Beatles Love,"Ive seen all the Cirque shows in Vegas. Sometimes they are so good I have to see them again. Beatles Love is a really cool show! So much going on at all times. So colorful. Acrobatics are great! Im not a huge Beatles fan and I have to admit I couldnt really follow the story line to the show. I think someone who has never heard of the Beatles (if they exist lol) could enjoy this show. I found a couple of the Cirques really have no plot but they are fabulous! I think families with kids would love this show too. 
* If youre Claustrophobic there is a spot in the show at the end that might not work for you. They completely cover the lower section of the audience with like a huge sheet. Between the lights and effects it looks like water covering the audience. Its really cool! (Photo 2). 
Would see this show again!"
Beatles Love,"A colossal disappointment. A bunch of of kids dancing to old Beatles songs. I didnt get it. For the amount of money per ticket I expected much more. Even the aerobics were meh. Ive seen a few Cirque shows and they all have amazing aerial moves. Until this one.

Im trying to come up with a few highlights and none come to mind. Maybe the big sheet that covers the audience. They went to a lot of effort with some extravagant sets. Unfortunately, no entertainment. 

All that aside. What was the point of this show? I truly believe it made no sense. No plot. Nothing accomplished. I was very close to asking for money back at the halfway point. 12/19"
Beatles Love,"What a great show featuring songs from The Beatles . The venue is located in The Mirage Hotel and it is huge. Its a Cirque Du Soleil show so theres a lot of acrobats and a lot going on at the same time.  

Definitely will recommend to all."
Beatles Love,My favorite Cirque show thus far. If you love the Beatles or even if you dont this show delivers. So much fun and nostalgia! Will definitely au to see it again!!!!
Beatles Love,"If you like the Beatles and you like Cirque, youll love the show. Ive seen this show 3 times and every time I am just very confused. I dont know enough about the Beatles history so throughout the performance I have no idea what is trying to be told through the music and dance. After the third time I was hoping id get more of it but this was the most confused yet. My friend knew slightly more than I did, and she loooved the show and tried explaining to me some of the parts I didnt get.

The acrobatics are amazing as always. This show contains a lot more dancing than other Cirque shows, I find a few of those bits to be uninteresting. I give it 4 stars because while this show is not for me, every person Ive gone with has totally loved it and left in awe. So i would tell anybody to give it a chance. All seats are good, small round venue. Id stay away from outer aisle seats as there are few obstructions."
Beatles Love,"I was pretty blanked out on what this show was about when I saw the billboards way back in 2007. I knew it was a Beatles show entitled Love and thought it was a tribute bands show. Fast forward 12 years later and after watching a few Cirque Du Soleil shows, we finally get to see this curiosity.

If you are a fan or familiar with the songs of John, Paul, George &amp; Ringo then go see this show. Music isnt live but is original Beatles music mixed smoothly into the shows choreography. In a nutshell it is a chronological Cirque interpretation of the groups journey.   What blew me away the most was the projections interacting with the performers and the blanketing of the audience under a sheet while a light show was going on top and actors operated under it.

As a tip its definitely better to enjoy this show from further seats as opposed to the ones nearest the stage."
Beatles Love,"This show is absolutely phenomenal. Total entertainment from start to finish. I came in skeptical because of a past experience with Cirque du Soleil KA, which put me to sleep periodically; and Im not a diehard Beatles fan. 

The set pieces, stage, performers, theatre I believe were all better here. KA felt more like a Broadway show, the performers were fantastic but the story was vague, with this show you dont need to know much about the Beatles to be able to follow the story of how their music played a role in history. Its energetic, engaging and worth every penny.

The seating chart is a little strange when buying tickets, but rest assured that this is a show with good views from 360 degrees. However some are better than others. If you are seating way down in the front you may end up missing something and instead become part of the experience. I was seated in Section 205 Row S Seats 14 &amp; 15, if youre buying tickets maybe dont buy tix 17 and up as view may be a bit obstructed."
Beatles Love,"Disclaimer: The performers are so talented; the acrobatics, dancers, rollerbladers...they are amazingly skilled. That being said, I didnt really like this show. 

I feel dumb saying this but, the music was way too loud (yes, I sound like Im 100 years old). I dont know why it needed to be so loud. So for those with hearing sensitivities, be aware that the music is very loud. 

They also chose the most obscure Beatles songs. At one point I turned to my husband and said, I feel like I need to be on acid to actually enjoy this show. Not a good feeling to have. 

Overall this show is just weird. I love musicals, plays &amp; the arts, but unfortunately I did not enjoy this show. It was a pretty dark and depressing kind of vibe; so if you are looking for a fun and upbeat show to see in Vegas; I wouldnt recommend this show. Please dont hunt me down and kill me for saying this!"
Beatles Love,"Do you love the Beatles? Do you love Cirque du Soleil?

If the answer to those questions is Yes, then definitely plan on attending this show. Overall the show is very good, and all the seats offer excellent views. Amazingly, the price for this show is quite low compared to the other shows and it was no where near sold out the night I was there. In contract the Michael Jackson show was much more expensive and was sold out the next night.

This show offers a very nice collection of the best Beatles songs, with some visual eye candy and some Cirque du Soleil acts. I had a very good time at this show and consider it a great bargain."
Beatles Love,"We love this show!!  We have seen it twice now and both times were great.  We recently watched with my sons (19 and 25) and they thourougly enjoyed the show as well.

All the acts, costumes, choreography...oh and did I mention all the great  Beatles music!!  The songs all have new meaning."
Beatles Love,"I have to preface this by disclaiming, I am a  HUGE Beatles fan!  That being said, the show was fantastic even if youre not a fan of the Fab 4.

If you ARE a Beatles fan, youll appreciate the allusions they make during songs like Blackbird (civil rights)  and faint one-liners from Shes Leaving Home at the end of one segment that really only heavy Beatles fans would catch. They subtly melded several songs like this that made me tear up.

The clever way theycomprised A Day in the Life with Johns face floating around during the majority of his parts of the song was superb.

The performers were excellent, their acrobatic and rollerskating/blading skills were impeccable.  The way they incorporated Ringo into Octopus Garden in a silly bubble was a perfect tribute to the drummer! And the blend of popular songs plus lesser-known to pop culture ones was a perfect combination. I cried several times during the show; not because it was sad, just because it was AMAZINGLY PERFECT.

I cant believe it took me this many years to finally see the performance, esp. living so close to NV but now it will be a yearly occurrence for us. I highly recommend it, even if youre not especially thrilled by acrobatics. Its just awe-inspiring!"
Beatles Love,"Wow! What a show! The finale to an amazing 20th anniversary week hiking the Utah National Parks. Chose the best seats at the point up front and, as Baby Boomers, we grew up on Beatles so one memory after another came to life before our eyes. It was wonderful! We won in Vegas because we didnt gamble a penny! Go see this amazing show!"
Beatles Love,"By far the best cirque weve ever watched, probably coz were familiar with the beatles songs. Performance was amazing and very entertaining. Didnt like the idea that we cant take pictures of the signage unless its official and the pictures they sell were just overpriced."
Beatles Love,"We were in the audience last night. Theres a scene where cast members are riding a boat, but unfortunately the wires broke off, causing the boat to hang upside down in the air. The staff had to turn the lights on and pull the cast out of the boat one by one. 
Its great that no one was hurt, and they offered refunds after they had the audience wait around for nearly 30 minutes. But it was very hard to see little kids trapped in the boat. They were hysterical and petrified when they were finally rescued. One guy had to hang upside down for over 10 minutes. I have an issue with them putting 6 year old kids in unsafe situations. Theres no reason kids should be on that boat. The audience cant even tell whos up there since its dark.

This is the last Cirque Du Soleil show Ill ever attend."
Beatles Love,"While at a work conference in sin city, I decided to see LOVE this one evening and it did not disappoint. If you are a fan of the Beatles, cirque du soleil or anything bright and memorizing, definitely see this show. Truth be told, I had waited years to see this show, so I was super excited and tested up when it began. I picked up my tickets at will call, and waited in line to enter the theatre. The line moved quickly and there were several ushers there to guide the way. Concessions were offered, so I grabbed a yummy strawberry fields cocktail and a popcorn and made my way to my seat. Greeted with more ushers that quickly directed me and I was ready for the show!

All cirque shows are visually entertaining, but paired with the Beatles music made it that much more magical! Since I bought my ticket day of, I was saddled with a ticket high up, however it proved to be ever in my favor when a scene came where they drapped a white cloth over the lower audience and projected an amazing, psychedelic experience with floating objects and theatrics! It was simply the coolest thing Ive seen! 

They played all the hits and had great story lines to match. I loved it so much, I plan to take my dad to the show in the near future."
Beatles Love,"We loved the show! Plenty for everyone to enjoy with interactive moments into the audience, dreamy sequences, funny moments, emotional moments,  romantic moments, etc. we went and had dinner for a bit after the show and came back to get our photos and look around the gift shop. Its open until 11 after the show so take your time elsewhere then come back!!"
Beatles Love,"If you like Beatles music, this show is a MUST! The performers are so extremely talented. Incredible is the best word I can use to describe the choreography. All movement is done to original Beatles music - the highlight of my trip to Las Vegas."
Beatles Love,"This was our second time seeing this show and its still amazing!

We had excellent seats and I like how the show characters move around the place so everyone gets an amazing experience. 

Highly recommend!"
Beatles Love,"This was amazing! The only negative was that they started 20+ minutes after the show time (930p). But the cast did a phenomenal job! It was a good mixture of music that everyone would know and some of the less popular songs. It was my moms second time seeing it and my first, and I absolutely would go back to watch again. 

You will want to sit further back for this show, as there is a bed sheet that covers most of the lower rows during one of the acts and youd miss out on whats going on on stage during that part. We ordered seats in the balcony, but the balcony was closed for this performance so we received seats in row R which were perfect."
Beatles Love,"Wow!  Even if your not a Beatles fan, youll know most every song and want to sing along! This show is super fun with great energy and costumes depicting the era. I recommend the large Strawberry fields show drink to complete this experience. Many people wondered if we missed a part of the show because we sat on the first row (due to lowering of the cover) Not at all, it was an awesome experience underneath!"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles LOVE show is one of many Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas and it was amazing. It was exciting that I knew all the songs and how they made a story out of it. I found it clever that in almost every act, there were four guys to represent the Beatles- as kids, as clowns, as roller skaters, etc. (hopefully this isnt a spoiler)
The venue is pretty small, so I think that any seat you reserve will be fine."
Beatles Love,"Besides O, this is my next favorite Cirque show in Las Vegas. Of course everyone loves the music, but the visual effects in this show are phenomenal. Its a round theater and all the seats have a good enough view but I think section 205 is best. Theres a lot going on the stage from ceiling to floor all the time. The graphics are great as well. There are several aerial acts and roller skaters. I love the costumes in this show - theyre so inventive. Ive seen the show when it first opened, and then a few years later. This version is very different from the early shows. I think it is better."
Beatles Love,"I went to see the Beatles Love show and it was spectacular!!! The tickets are on the pricier side and there isnt much of a discount but it is well worth it!!  All the seating are great because the venue isnt big so everyone has an unobstructed view of the stage.

The acrobatics and dancing were amazing and so was the music and story line.  They did a great job interpreting the characters in the Beatles song without losing the Beatles identity. There were even authentic short dialogues and videos from the band incorporated into the show.   The mesmerizing scenery enhanced the show. I can see why it is popular and have lasted all these years.  The best part is that it is so up-lifting!!

Definitely a re-do when I come back to Vegas !!"
Beatles Love,What a surprise! Sat in the second row from the stage and had the best time ever. Weve been to a few different Cirque shows and wasnt sure what to expect from a musical type show. Really entertaining and fascinating to watch. We loved it
Beatles Love,"Outstanding show!  So much going on with costuming, of course the awesome music, aerialists, the stage constantly transforming, special effects, acrobatics.....its a sensory explosion!

We sat in section 201 row L and had great seats but actually the way the show is done on a constantly moving stage in the round with aerialists and set pieces coming down from the ceiling consistently....there really is no bad seats in that theater.

Yes.  Get the tickets, see the show.  You wont regret it."
Beatles Love,I was reluctant to watch this show but Im so glad I made it because it was simply superb! The performances was just so enthralling and everyone on stage was just amazing! A huge shoutout to all the artists and people behind the scenes. The Beatles Love was a magical ride and thoroughly entertaining.
Beatles Love,"Not only was the show simply amazing, but while I was there I had a small medical issue. The staff, Michelle and Bridget in particular, were so very kind and loving. They took care of my every need and went above and beyond. True angels on earth! Thanks to both of them from Jodi the Birthday Girl.

And, again, the show was fabulous! We sat up high and could see everything beautifully. There isnt a bad seat in the house.

Excellent!!"
Beatles Love,"Great performance! The Beatles LOVE show and the euphoric Beatles song played were reminiscent to what made me fell in love with their music. The show will give you different sense of emotions depending how open-minded you are. The allusions for their theme-dance-art blended with the songs that portrayed it through acrobatic performances was as entertaining at best. 

Thank you Cirque du Soleil - The Beatles LOVE for the amazing performance and show. It is truly Awe-inspiring. 

Reminds me why I love The Bealtes. 

John.C"
Beatles Love,"WHAT AN AMAZING SHOW!! All the classic Beatle songs! We knew that we had to see a Cirque du Soleil show when we were in a Vegas and decided on this one. It did not disappoint!  

My boyfriend doesnt listen to the Beatles but throughly enjoyed the show. We bought our tickets in advance and had pretty nice seats. Spent around ~$120 per ticket. 

Definitely would come back!"
Beatles Love,"Enjoyed the nostalgia of the Beatles music and loved the interpretation of the songs through the performances.

Nonetheless, this was the least favorite of the Cirque performances Ive seen so far (Ive seen Quidam, Luzia, Totem, and a couple others)

This was more about the dancing and the special effects vs the acrobatics. If thats what youre looking for, I dont recommend this show. 

There were skaters that were impressive, some trampoline work and a breakdancer that were my favorites. 

Maybe it was my mistake that I didnt look too far into the reviews, but I was really expecting the crazy stunts like the other Cirque shows Ive come to know and love. It missed the mark on the wow factor for me."
Beatles Love,"Another must see Cirque show.
Im not a big Beatles fan and I thoroughly enjoyed the show; so if you love the Beatles youll
Love the show !
Great props and production !
Interesting stage / set up.
Great use of space and theatrics.
Highly recommend along with Ka at MGM which is my personal favorite."
Beatles Love,"Wow! Just wow. How could I have missed one of the greatest shows on earth all this time?

My little 9-year old has taken a liking with The Beatles songs lately so Dad and I decided to whisk him away to a quick trip to Vegas to fancy a Cirque du Soleil show. We bought tickets and we were not really expecting much, we just wanted to hear The Beatles songs really.  They have food and drinks for purchase before the show starts. I cannot miss the strawberry fields drink, its one of those got to have it. The Staff were really friendly and helpful and gave my son a cushion lift to sit on so that he can see everything. 

The show itself was spectacular! It was breathtaking, it was mesmerizing, it moves you, it overwhelms you with so much emotions and memories of the past. It was purely beautiful! From the lighting, the audio, the costumes, the stage design, and the acrobatic performers- wow!  All three of us me, hubby and even little 9-year old were in awe and almost teary-eyed with some of the songs.

It was a beautiful evening, one that will definitely go down in the books. Weve also created a beautiful memory with our son that he will remember for many, many years through this show."
Beatles Love,"What a beautiful show! My husband and I loved it! The music, the energy, the talent! Highly recommend this show to anyone! Ive seen it twice and would still see it again. I took my mom the first time."
Beatles Love,"This show was great. I love the Beatles and a bit of a psychedelic vibe, so this was right up my alley."
Beatles Love,"Spectacular!

Our first Cirque du Soleil show! It was fun to watch the acrobatic performances by these extraordinary artists as they balance, dance, and perform crazy human feats with agility and skill to the tunes of the Beatles. We were just behind one row from the front stage and although they were good seats now that Ive seen how the performance played out I wouldve rather sat a little further in the back rows to get a complete visual of the stage. The stage was always busy with performers coming from all sides, corners and above!

I enjoyed the colorful props, the high-flying performances, the artistic costumes, theatrical fog and strobe effects, the songs and the overall theme. Having given Beatles LOVE the kudos they deserve it is still an acrobat show and Im probably in the minority when I say this... I most likely will lean on not watching another Cirque du Soleil performance. I only liked this particular show because it had music background that Im familiar with -- the Beatles. Even so I am not familiar with all the Beatles songs so sometimes I dont understand the story being acted with the song. Also, late last year (Nov 2017), we signed up to attend the Magical Technical Tour where they showed behind the scenes of how the rigging, automation, lighting projections, sound, and the props all played out in the Beatles LOVE. We thought it was cool... it was free admission.

Glad to have a chance to see our first Cirque du Soleil show at Beatles LOVE. After the show we took a look at the merchandise displayed at the Store. There is also a neon backdrop with a silhouette of the Beatles for photo ops. If youre a fan of the Fab Four this show is a must see! This is performing at The Mirage.

Review #1059"
Beatles Love,"If you are or are not a Beatles fan this show is a go to see for sure. I was in between a 4 and a 5 only because I wasnt totally taken back by the acrobatics, expected a little more from a Cirque Du Soleil production but the theatrics edged it up to a 5. Costumes and general performance were over the top and of course the music was incredible; there was a moment during the performance where they draped an enormous soft, silky sheet like material over the entire audience while a song was playing- epic moment. The Beatles, ( John, Paul, George and Ringo) and featured during the performance and their actual voices are images are consistently intermingled throughout, was not expecting that  and is a highlight for sure. I think its well worth the money and there is not a bad seat in the house...great for kids also."
Beatles Love,"AMAZING SHOW! We had some really good seats and I was so impressed with the show. Amazing music, beautiful choreography. Of all the cirque du soleil shows I have seen, I think this one is my favorite. It definitely surprised me and there were some cool interactive stuff which was very interesting. I will definitely recommend this to other people and would watch it again if Im ever in town and have other people interested in going to see it. Everything about this show was beautiful."
Beatles Love,"Towards the end of our stay in Vegas, we decided to see what deals we could get on a show. We went to the discounted ticket kiosks that are littered around the strip and found that we could get very good Beatles LOVE tickets for ~79 dollars (if purchased between 9am-11am that day).
Upon entering the theater in The Mirage Casino and Hotel, we were greeted by an iconic and wonderful light exhibit (that you have probably seen on IG). Before starting the show, I grabbed a London Mule (aka a moscow mule) to quench my thirst during the 1.5 hour show.  We sat in the upper section where both the center stage and the peripherals were able to be seen.   The show started and immediately I was in awe. Set pieces and performers appeared and disappeared from every direction.  The dancing, visuals, and music combined to be an amazing experience.    My only complaint is that the music was LOUD...if you have sensitive ears, I would recommend some earplugs."
Beatles Love,An amazing show. But this is much more of a music and dancing show then it is a on the edge of your seat Cirque du Soleil acrobatic show. A lot of hanging from ropes and swinging about.
Beatles Love,"We had seen this performance a few years ago and we enjoyed it. We thought we might enjoy it one more time and we did. This is not one of those sound like the Beatles performances, it is the original music with performers putting the words into context. It is quite entertaining and probably among the best shows in Las Vegas. 
Dont expect a Beatles imitator and you wont be disappointed. Great music, dancing and performing."
Beatles Love,"Can I give them a 10+ star review. This show is amazingly good soo brilliant. I grew up listening to the Beatles so being able to see this show for my 25th Birthday was an absolute dream. The show wasnt even finished and I knew I had to return. My Bestfriend gave me this as a gift front row tickets. 

Everything from the beginning to the end was amazing, the production, the dancers, the customer service, the drinks and food were all extremely consistent. 

They have a good variety of alcoholic drinks especially to those that like the fruity stuff like I do, I had the Strawberry fields in the souvenir cup and it was delicious tasted like strawberry starbursts and it was a huge portion for the price. 

Recommend Next time getting tickets In the middle or towards the top so youre able to see better. The theater is small and super intimate you feel like you are almost part of the show, they did such a great job with the storylines for each song."
Beatles Love,"They broke down in the last 10 minutes and didnt offer anything for the troubles. It is an amazing show, but when something like this happens, even in the last 10 minutes they should offer something. The last part of the show is the BEST! And we missed it. They just made us sit there for 20 minutes with nothing. Feel sorry for the next show."
Beatles Love,"This show is amazing. For anyone familiar with Beatles music, you would be amazed how it
has been combined to create this fantastic story. Excellent venue, great service."
Beatles Love,"I brought my 5 year old for her birthday, she absolutely loved it! She laughed, she sang, she was mesmerized by everything and everyone on stage. We sat in the 2nd row and someone came and brought her a booster without us even asking (very thoughtful). Before the show some of the performers were walking around and one of them tossed what looked like rose petals on my daughter (it was paper) but it looked so beautiful coming down, she was so excited and it definitely set the tone for the evening. I really liked it and watching it with my daughter made it special, Im glad its kid friendly."
Beatles Love,Amazing! You will be mad when it ends and want to watch more. It was truly the best show Ive ever seen.
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque show ever. Im a fan of the Beatles - one of the greatest bands in the world! 
My favorite part was listening to the songs as this brought back feelings of nostalgia. The acts were all very impressive as well. However, I was a bit confused from the beginning to the middle because I couldnt see a connection between the song lyrics and the choreography. It doesnt seem like there is a plot or consistency to the story either. Anyway, my favorite ones were Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Something, and Hey Jude."
Beatles Love,"Amazing show at the Mirage!!! 

If you are a Beatles fan this show is definitely more exciting and in a nice intimate venue where every angle side and seat makes it enjoyable with great views. It was nostalgic to hear the music and see the different acts throughout as each and every part of the cast was very talented with dancing, acts, and acrobatics explaining the story visually and through The Beatles music. The inside and outside of the of the venue all have wonderful decor, lighting, and ambiance. 5 Stars.~"
Beatles Love,"This is a must see!  I have seen it three times.  The sound, performers, music, set designs and effects are mesmerizing. You dont have to love the Beatles to enjoy this show, but who doesnt?

If you can only see one show, see this one.  And P.S. whatever you do, dont even think about KA, it sucks so bad."
Beatles Love,An absolutely amazing show! My wife and I attended several years ago and again just a few weeks back. We loved it both times. Youll have enjoy it immensely if you get a chance to attend.
Beatles Love,"Best show Ive been to in Vegas. It did not disappoint. A MUST see for any Beatles fan. The performances were beautiful, artistic and amazing and synchronized perfectly to the best of the Beatles in each decade. There is no bad seating but we did pay for the pricey seats right above the lower orchestra and pleased we did.  My boyfriend is not too familiar with the Beatles music but still enjoyed the show, so definitely recommend seeing this show!"
Beatles Love,"I wish there was an option for 6 stars. This show blew me away. I had seen Ka awhile back and thought it was good, but this had it all...skill, music, emotion, technical bells and whistles that will blow your mind. Go!!"
Beatles Love,Amazing show. My girlfriend is a die hard Beatles fanatic lol. She loved it. I enjoyed it a lot even though Im a few years younger and never really listened to the Beatles. The ending was awesome. We got the cheapest tickets which were $87 on Mirage website and the seats were the last row at the top but let me tell you the view was still amazing. The theatre isnt huge and there is a part in the show youll thank me for being up higher lol. Definitely recommend whether your a Beatles fan or not.
Beatles Love,"This is definitely my favorite Cirque show. My second time seeing and I think it was even better than the first. I dont really consider myself a Beatles fan.. I enjoy their music. Well, some of their songs, but I never really go out of my way for them. However this show is awesome. So much fun! 
I love how Cirque subtly tells a story. Thats always so much going on, but its easy to follow it all. 

My favorite part are the female dancers that twirl through the sky. Its crazy they are hooked up to some kind of rotating bracket that gives them so much freedom and they can just easily twirl, somersault and spin through the air with no hindrance. Obviously, a slow about Beatles is going to have a lot of color. Very bright, energetic sets! My friends favorite part was the VW bus. I enjoyed it too great concept with the bouncy, trampoline roof. 

Theyre a lot of talent in this show thats for sure!"
Beatles Love,"I did not know what to expect but was feeling the flow that got me there. We had 4th row seats and by looking around at the way the stage was set, we were all in it. This was a kaleidoscope of colors and nostalgia, there was a swell in the room from everyone being in awe of this elaborate conjunction of bold soaring storytelling trapeze acts with these fantastical costumes and stage mechanisms. As someone who partook in some vaping and edibles, this was my naughty little caprice; for my elderly foreign born parents with no familiarity with in your face, fully immersed visual art and music this changed their life. I would totally do this all over again, it was a lot of fun."
Beatles Love,"We sat at a front row.  Loud but true to the beatles and quite a show.
We would go again, thus the 5 star rating."
Beatles Love,"I had a chance to visit Las Vegas recently staying at Caesars and I decided to see LOVE by Cirque du Soleil at the Mirage next door. I like the Beatles music and boy, this show does not disappoint. If you love the Beatles music then its a must show to see in Vegas. 

The color, the acrobatics, the dancers, the productions....etc .... everything in between, Awesome show... The show is about 95 minutes. And I got a good deal on the Price too, paid about $79 for a top row seat. 
The 3 Songs really stand out for me: Strawberry Fields Forever; Here Comes the Sun and Octopuss Garden. Wow, just wow, The cirque dancers are also great and awesome. Overall, this show is worth every pennies. 5 stars, this is as good as it gets in Vegas."

VIP Next to Stage Seat: Sec 105 Row E Seat 8

What can I add to already been said about Cirque du Soleil THE BEATLES LOVE Show:  Many people love it, some hate it, some feel it needs revamping, while others complain the psychedelic party doesnt sell out. 

I AM A CLOSET BEATLES FAN!
I love every production made by Cirque du Soleil; so when it comes to seeing all seven Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas, I decide to start this vacation with the classic.  First off, all Beatles songs premiere by Cirque du Soleil have been digitally remastered.  You will hear every music notes, twangs, vocal chords without distortion.  I am taken by surprise from the large volume of familiar Beatles tunes utilize by television commercials.  Hey, I heard that before!  Its by The Beatles? No way...

ENORMOUS STAGE PRODUCTION!
I am overwhelmed by the mere size of dancers, aerial acrobats, video installation and stage props accompanying every Beatles song.   Some themes more trippy &amp; psychedelic - drug induce - than I care for, but my 32oz of White Daquiri LOVE Special with a shot of Tequila positively enhances the experience!

FRIENDLY CROWD PLEASING SHOW
I have made so many video recordings and taken so many photographs from my iphone without a problem!  In fact, Cirque du Soleil performers walk right up to me and greeted with a smile or pat on shoulder and even pose for my camera.  

THANK YOU BEATLES FOR BEING A PART OF
MY NAUGHTY BUT NICE XXX SOCIAL CALENDAR!"
Beatles Love,"I have seen many shows in Las Vegas. And this is not the best show Ive seen. Especially compared to the other Cirque du Soleils, it is on the bottom of my list.
Overall show was mediocre with few cool moments. Storyline was dull and boring. Circus was okay. Music choices were disappointments. Definitely missing most peoples favorite Beatles music.
Im giving this show 3 stars since some of our family members that we were with actually enjoy the show. Maybe if this was my first Cirque du Soleil, I would have enjoyed more with less expectations."
Beatles Love,"If you dont see the show, at least see the entrance 
and visit the gift shop!! 

Must see for any Beatle-mania fanatics. 

This was the first Cirque du Soleil show I ever experienced while Ive been living in Las Vegas. This show was so LOVELY, it made me want to see as many Cirque shows as I can if not all!

As if the 60s was alive, recreated colorfully before us through the music. the audio is also amazing in this show, adds to the show very well. Talented passionate performers, singers dancers, costumes and actors overall well coordinated team.

Highlight of this particular venue, performance is literally center stage, round - so great seats all around! Ha! Which is unlike the other cirque shoes Ive seen which are usually more theater like stages. It seriously contributed to a scene in the show where the audience participates in creating an illusion! I dont want to spoil it but it was my favorite.. so amazing from the top overview, curious what the underneath was like.  Very creative set accessories, and costumes. This is a cirque show I would watch again. They recently updated the brand look and added new acts to show as well so Ill likely be back soon!"
Beatles Love,"90% Beatles retrospective, 10% Cirque.  Easily my least favorite Cirque show Ive ever seen. Gets really repetitive.

I probably went in with the wrong expectations... assuming it would be an acrobatic Cirque show with a Beatles theme... but its actually just a Beatles show with some mediocre stunts relative to the insanity of other Cirque shows.

Its mainly just dancing, dancing, dancing... then a rope stunt. Repeat. With other Cirque shows, they make you sweat with how scary the stunts are. This one? Its like JV Cirque, nothing that puts you on the edge of your seat. Also, they keep doing variations of the same wire/ropes stunts. You think its great at first but after a while, its, This AGAIN!?

I will say that if you are a Beatles fan, youll love it for that. A number of fans were rocking out for sure. Just go in not thinking of it as a Cirque show and, instead, a Beatles show."
Beatles Love,"Im a Beatles fan and I had just watched their Hulu documentary, Eight Days a Week so I was beyond stoked to find last minute discount tickets on Travelzoo. Ive seen my share of Cirque du Soleil shows but this just may be my new favorite! My husband and in-laws felt the plot was not fully coherent (understandable with the appearance of the devil and the KKK), but the show itself is a trippy spectacle. Highly recommend sitting almost nosebleed to get the best view. Several portions of the show can only be fully appreciated when seated up in the top stadium seats. Highlight of my Christmas vacation."
Beatles Love,"Im not a huge fan of the beatles, but got free tickets to the show so thought id give it a shot.
The show is nothing like the other shows in vegas, nothing fancy, all over the place, the good thing about it is that it tells the story of the beatles, how they started all the way till the end, so thats nice along with some songs and soundtracks.
If you are a huge beatles fan go check it out, otherwise, save your money!"
Beatles Love,Im a Beatles fan and I found my toes tapping a few times but this was just weird.  Ive never tried LSD but this is what it must be like.  Definitely would not recommend this show.
Beatles Love,"Bucket list item #10 : See a Cirque du Soleil show. IN VEGAS.
Totally able to cross that off now!

With all 6 of us in tow, we made reservations for the show of the year as advertised. Being a huge Beatles fan, I was thrilled to experience the music and see what this show had to offer - and let me tell you, it was OUTSTANDING!!

++ Literally all the best, and most unique songs are played during the performances - making everyone sing along!
++ Interactive pieces to the performance! We participated in a large sheet being draped over the crowd and often the performers were engaging with the audience to clap and dance!
++ Amazing costumes all projecting different periods of time, with corresponding themes! 
++ Killer stunts featuring everything from a VW Bus and trampolines, to Arial acts on a simple rope!
++ Located in The Mirage with pricing set at just $50/ticket!

I could easily go on and on about this show, but Ill stop here. 
YOU MUST GO!"
Beatles Love,"This was an enjoyable show.  If you like the Beatles its pretty cool.  A little different from O and Myrteri as this is more dance oriented, but they have acrobats and all that other stuff too.

Ot"
Beatles Love,Love this show. Had everything incorporated perfectly. The effects were amazing as the giant strings of material fly into the crowd. Fell in love with all their songs all over again and the performers did a great job. Probably my favorite cirque show.
Beatles Love,"This was without a doubt the BEST Cirque du Soleil show I have seen!

PROS: 

You dont have to be a Beatles fan to enjoy this show. We took my 67 year old mother who speaks Spanish and she was totally enthralled with the performance. 

The way the staging is set, there really isnt a bad seat in the theater. Its more about the visuals of The Fab Four and their timeless music being applied to the dancing and acrobatics. There is so much to see that you find yourself trying to focus on everything. Panning the audience I saw so many people with their hands on their chins just taking everything in.

Seating is very well organized but give yourself plenty of time to get to the theater. We couldnt find our Uber driver and almost missed the show!

The performance runs close to two hours and you FLOAT out of the theater. I was recovering from surgery and I was feeling kinda grumpy before the performance. Afterwards, I was all smiles. You will be too.

CONS: Absolutely NO flash photography or video recordings allowed or your phone will be confiscated! 

TIP: You will want to buy so much Beatles swag in the gift shop especially the music. However, if you already subscribe to Apple Music/Itunes ($4.99 month..better than Pandora) you can download The Beatles LOVE album in its entirety as part of your subscription.

Have an amazing time! Love to everyone. Amor y saludos para todos!"
Beatles Love,"Amazing new show by the masters of showmanship and acrobatics!

This riveting performance lasts about 1:30, and is peppered with over a dozen Beatles favorites throughout.  Typical acrobatics and fetes of physical skill, this show also has very colorful costuming and an original story.  

They actually perform over the crowd with some of the performance, and you truly feel mesmerized by the music and the sights and sounds.

See this soon..."
Beatles Love,"We came here on a Friday night, the theater is not seating full
The stage is in the middle of the seats, which is really fun
This show is great, good Music and good dancer
I had a wonderful night 
I would say this one is better that The One show, and at a lower price. I highly recommend"
Beatles Love,"This is a wonderful show.  We went last week on New Years Eve. The performers must truly be considered athletes given the phenomenal physical work and mental concentration.  The set is full of interesting designs and props.  Theres so much happening at one time, that its best not to fixate too long on one part as you might miss something else happening.  We sat in the upper section and were able to see fine.  In fact, the upper section allows a better view of the performers who descend from the catwalks.  The performances were choreographed to the Beatles music well, and the props used really made the lyrics vivid.  I would return to see this show again.  Photography without flash is allowed."
Beatles Love,"Who doesnt love a good Cirque du Soleil show?  If you dont, then its because youve never been!
The Beatles....Love is a absolutely wonderful show with some humor mixed with some more thought provoking moments.  Youll hear all their hits played out to a timeline of world events. Definitely a must see!
One thought...do not take the first couple of rows as the best seats are going to be roughly row five on back!"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles? Count me in. 
Cirque du Soleil? Yea, why not. 
Combine the two? OHH YEAA.

Ive seen enough Cirque shows to know that the is no such thing as bad seats (unless it just happens to be obstructed) and I actually prefer the seats in the back since you dont have to crane your neck. We had the perfect view of everything from the back (all performers, corners, screens).

The show starts out slow but things really kick into gears half way through. By the end, Im crying from the performance and nostalgia, and then when it ends, Im just sad there isnt more. Beautifully choreographed to the songs and just flows so perfectly."
Beatles Love,"I am a Cirque Du Soliel fan, having seen all of the Vegas shows except the Michael Jackson one(NO interest) and many of the touring shows when they come to my city.    That said, I dont get all of the love for this show at all.     If you see it as your first Cirque show, you may think it is swell, but not so much after you have seen the others.    Where was the acrobatics and feats of daring do?     Other than some roller skaters and the very repetitive air dancing acts(they hang from ropes or what look like curtains), there was nothing but dancing, which I am not at all into.  Really couldnt wait for the show to end sadly."
Beatles Love,"If you drop acid (LSD), you will love this show. The show was descent and the venue is real good. I recommend the second level in the 200s series. However, I didnt understand the point of the pregnant Zimbabwe woman doing the African anteater ritual dance? Weird is all I can say."
Beatles Love,I would give 0 stars if I could but I wanted to write a review (which Ive never done before) some red headed woman and grey haired man kicked us out for enjoying the show. If you are looking to have a good time in Vegas and want to sing along to songs in a half empty auditorium this aint it.  No wonder no one goes
Beatles Love,"This is my second Cirque du Soleil and they do not disappoint.  The acrobats the flips the rollerblades the bungee cords they bounce up and down on simply amazing. Artistic design and engineering fabulous. The stage choreography and costumes thumbs up.
They do have some dark scenes in it because they take you through history but they put a little love in our hearts!!"
Beatles Love,"Show was awesome. Every seat in house was great. Its a great family show. Sings,performers were awesome. Costumes were amazing. Its a must see show."
Beatles Love,"We finished up a family vacation in Las Vegas and my daughters really wanted to see LOVE. I indulged them by buying discounted tickets ($90 each) to the 9:30 show. Ill be honest and admit that I dont like spending lots of money for entertainment. But I didnt regret for one minute spending money on this show!! What an incredible experience! The music, the set designs, the amazing physical feats--it was just about the best 1 &amp; 1/2 hours that Ive ever spent. Cant wait to go back and see it again. If you only have the chance to see one Vegas show in your lifetime, Im pretty sure that this should be the one!"
Beatles Love,"Fantastic show.
Almost too much going on at one time.
Some really trippy scenes
Everyone from the teens to the seniors enjoyed it"
Beatles Love,"After recently seeing Volta in San Francisco, Beatles LOVE was a welcome surprise. I thought this was going to be some staged stories set to music but not a technical extravaganza.  Instead it absolutely blew me away!  I am a fan of the music but not specifically a Beatles enthusiast.   The stage work, lighting, video, moving screens, actor interactions, costuming and acrobatics were stunning.  The literature claims there are 130 songs referenced in the lobby, pre-show and in the show itself.  I really liked their selection taking their later work from Sgt. Peppers, Revolver, White Album, Yellow Submarine and Magical Mystery Tour etc.   You hear some variants on old favorites too. i.e. instrumentals or different mixes. 
From the first moment of the show, the place features surprises in every direction you can see. I kept thinking -OMG, there are things happening everywhere! This is SO COOL!.   The stage has walkways and lifts to flatten or provide deep pits. There are semi transparent screens that can shift or be lifted up which take on video projections or animated actors or scene elements to add to the show.   The two side walls have massive wide band video screens with old footage and interviews etc.  The scene, stage, video, projection screens &amp; costuming is constantly changing shifting.  I was just absolutely transfixed with the acrobatic thrills, clever routines, visual effects, lighting and costuming for about 2 hours.  I never got bored.  I didnt think anything was dumb or too silly.  Sometimes I feel C.d.S. caters to kids which is fine but this was a more adult oriented theme and in a couple songs bordered on burlesque but not offensive.  There is a ton of good music.  The sound stage is massive and immersive utilizing speakers throughout the entire theater. 
      I have heard that people complain that the story was not coherent etc.  I dont need it all spelled out for me.  There were a lot of fun scenes and costumes from Yellow Submarine that dredged up some wonderful childhood memories.   I was immensely satisfied and felt that the memory has lasting power for many weeks.  I would not return to Vegas without seeing this again.   So happy we saw this over O  at $250.  
Seriously $100 easy..."
Beatles Love,Wow they put on a great show!!!  I sat on the back row in the middle and it was perfect!  I suggest sitting higher up like we did.  There is so much going on and all these big screens that its best to sit higher to capture it all.  There was never a dull moment!  Obviously The Beatles have AMAZING music...but to see it come to life was spectacular!  This is a MUST SEE SHOW if you are in Vegas!
Beatles Love,"Beatles = check!
Cirque show = check!
Great night = Check!
Ticketing experience = terrible.

Overall, I had a blast at this show! I went with my mom to a 9:30pm showing on a Thursday night, and it was definitely enjoyable!

The ticket buying experience was the worst part... we purchased the most expensive tickets online in the best spot possible, and when my mom went inside to get them from Will Call, they said they couldnt find the order. Well we were charged $450 for 2 tickets so I know they had it, but they couldnt find it in their system. So, after 30 minutes of back/forth &amp; searching their system to no avail, they wrote on a pad of paper lost/stolen tickets and said to give them to the ticket people at the door, itd be fine.  

Turns out, it was fine... but when you spend almost $500 for 2 tickets, youd think itd be a better experience than being handed a post-it note to get in.

The show itself was incredible.... the performers were great, the music was great, and I loved how interactive it was :) it totally put some of the songs in perspective - or made me think differently about how the song was maybe created. LOVED it!

All in all, I would recommend this - but maybe buy tickets over the phone or in person.... it definitely took away from our experience.  Get it together, Mirage!"
Beatles Love,"Different than any Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen. But I do appreciate more dancing and acrobatics so this is my favorite of the ones Ive seen thus far. 

This show is pretty much like 90 minutes of straight Beatles music videos. Except its live, happening in front of your eyes, and super interactive! Theres more audience interaction that any show Ive been to and it was fun and super cool. 

Im a Beatles music lover so I had goosebumps all over as they started with their earlier music and transitioned to the later ones. Theres also a little history, Beatles storyline, and major 1960s and 1970s throwback. I love vintage fashion so all the costumes, dance techniques, and Beatles love made my evening!"
Beatles Love,"Ive watched this show twice and loved it even more the second time around.

Growing up, I heard pretty much all Beatles Albums and Songs.

This amazing show takes you back to the times when the world was less stressful and everyone wanted nothing else to do but LOVE.

The venue is just the right size, not too big or too small and the sound is perfect.

The color combos and the acts/sets are unbelievable, I felt like I was in a dream. 

The story from beginning to end is well thought and put together.  

If youre not looking for a magic show or a concert, this is the place to be.  

There are acrobats, dancing and lots of lights. 

Whether you are a Beatles Fan or not, you will appreciate the music, talent and how it all comes together."
Beatles Love,"The Beatles Love by Cirque du Soleil located at the Mirage in Las Vegas is a very easy show to enjoy. As with the Michael Jackson One show, the shows primary strength is in its unparalleled soundtrack. If you dont enjoy the music of the Beatles, I really dont know what to tell you. Do you even understand what joy is?. As one would hope, the show features spectacular set pieces accompanied by the best soundtrack you have ever heard. The set pieces themselves dont necessarily make sense in the way they attempt to portray the songs, but thats not what you came for. You want to watch spectacular acrobats do crazy stuff while listening to the Beatles. Congratulations, you are in the right place."
Beatles Love,"Magical performance. Transcendent even. IMHO, among the best Cirque de Soleils. The music was fantastic, and the sound system blew me away. Highly recommended ( if you like the Beatles, of course)!"
Beatles Love,"Beautiful. Do not miss this if you are a Beatles fan! The music is incredible, and the dancing is out of this world! Ive never seen such wonderfully creative sets and props, and all the colors and dynamic transitions will keep you riveted. I do wish they had better aerial. They are Cirque du Soleil, and straps act aside, I was hoping for better flying. Lucy in sky with diamonds could have done more than just a few splits. It also would have been nice if some of the music were live. Still, its a once in the lifetime experience, and it really shows how versatile Cirque can be. Also appeals to all ages and genders so theres something for everyone."
Beatles Love,"So amazing.  We are theatre people and were gasping the whole show.  I  meant is cirque so there is a very slight plot (not why you go),but truly the most incredible,eye popping stuff you will ever see, all done to Beatles music(the sound is incredible...dont worry about where you are sitting, you will hear it...you have speakers all around you.
the one thing i want you say about seats is...we had the cheapest seats, and they are amazing.  Some people talk about the curtains that cover some of the stuff...they leave, and come back,"
Beatles Love,This show is amazing. It brings together everything that you would want to see you in a good show. Obviously the music was great
Beatles Love,"What an amazing show! Very eclectic, colorful, far out and exciting show. We sat in the last row and it was perfect. The show is all around you so for us it did not matter where we sat. Go see this show."
Beatles Love,"The best Cirque du Soleil show.  I loved how everyone was just singing and truly enjoying themselves.  The. Nosebleed seats are the best!  The acrobatics fly right over you or they are waiting at the top of the theatre to fly down.  Sometimes they fly right over you.  They also have a huge screen showing different images.  They had this really cool Love Van,Mr. Mustard made an an appearance.  I loved this show so much.  Compared to the way overpriced O Show.  This is a much better deal.  I wish I would have gone to see it again."
Beatles Love,100% awesome.  If you like the Beatles this show touches on a lot of the big hits and brings back the memories.  It makes get the feels when you listen to the music and watch these performers do what they do!
Beatles Love,Not a fan of acrobatic shows but I loved this.  Disclaimer:  I am a huge Beatles fan from way back.  I found the music and the performances very enchanting and emotional. How could anyone not like it?  Get your tickets in the second tier for the best view but almost no bad seats so dont waste money on the top price ticket.  As they say All you need is Love.
Beatles Love,"Great show. Great show. I dont think Id recommend it for an epileptic because of all of the flashes, or for children because of the F-BOMB. But all others this is a good show, great watch"
Beatles Love,"Cirque du Soleil did it again! We had a great time at this show last night! The sound system was awesome and it really bought this experience to life for us. 

Ive seen 5 or so other Cirque shows and this one by far had the most beautiful stage/props. It was truly beautiful. The music was great and they used it to set a really great mood for the audience on the 75 minute journey on which they take you. 

What really makes these shows most spectacular for me is the acrobatics. I love the death defying stunts! They had some in this show but not as many as some others Ive been to. So the -1 star is totally due to my personal desire to have seen more acrobatics. 

I can assure you that you will not be disappointed if you see Love. Cirque to Soleil never ceases to impress me! 

Go see it!"
Beatles Love,"Id agree with a lot of the other reviews. If you are a Beatles fan like I am its a must see and youll love it. 
Other reviews said its a lot more dancing and less aerobatics than other cirque shows. This having been the only cirque show Ive seen I cant confirm that but I suspected it to be true. It reminded me more of a musical with some aerobatics in the background. 

All that being said, I had a wonderful time because I so enjoy the music of the Beatles. The costumes were great, the selection of music was very good, with some interesting mashups. (Within you without/tomorrow never knows as an example)


My personal preference for Beatles music tends to be Rubber Soul onwards and to the best of my recollection other than two songs (I want to Hold Your Hand, Help!), every song was from that album or subsequent.

I think its 5/5 for a Beatles fan. I just put 4/5 since its also a cirque du soleil show and maybe some people who are fans of cirque but not necessarily fans of the Beatles might not be blown away."
Beatles Love,"I was honestly surprised to see mixed reviews on Yelp for this show...but to each his/her own. Me? Im a Cirque junkie. Ive been astonished and entertained at every show that I have attended...and Love was no different.

The combination of acrobatics, outstanding dancing, visual effects, costumes and...of course...music...kept me entertained for the entire show. As with any other Cirque De Soleil production, there is usually a lot going on at one time and its hard to figure out where to focus ones attention.

So many talented people working together in this round, unusual theater at the Mirage. The only issue is that theres one exit from the theater and the mass exodus takes a while to get through,"
Beatles Love,"So fun!!

Pros:
- If you are a fan of Beatles music, you will really enjoy the show. They performed to all the classics
- That theater is amazing. We sat towards the top of the first section (the mezzanine was closed), and it didnt matter. We still got an awesome view of the entire stage. The theater was built so it would be a great view from wherever you sit!
- Seats were comfortable
- Show was super entertaining. It was a nice mix of dancing, acrobatics and a few performances - the Lucy in the Sky performance was probably my favorite. Great for the entire family
- Super large mixed drinks. I went to get a bottle of water, and somehow ended up also ordering a huge drink called, Strawberry Fields. So dangerous. Im no light weight by any means, but I was pretty tossed after finished that drink
- Super friendly ushers and staff
- Free upgrade. I guess they didnt sell as many tickets as they would have liked. I paid for seats on the mezzanine and got upgraded
- I love that the theater is not too far from the entrance of the Mirage. Other theaters can be such a trek from the front door of the casino, but this theater was very close to the casino entrance

Cons:
- None I can think of. 

Would I come again? Sure!"
Beatles Love,"Spectacular!!! On a whim, my wife and I decided to see Love. I am so happy that we did. It was beyond our expectations. Id go again."
Beatles Love,"Love the show. However, the beginning of the show was a bit too much. The music was way too loud. Speakers were screeching. Wanted to cover my ears but didnt. Couldnt stand the music. After the first 2 songs, everything was better. It toned down the music and show. Whew. The lighting was beautiful. The slow, melodramatic songs were great along with the cirque acts. My favorite part was the white sheet over the seats and lighted ocean scene. Beautiful. I only knew a few songs. Although, that didnt matter. If youre really into the Beatles and a fan, youll love this show! We sat in section 201 row O. I got it at a good deal through myVEGAS. The discount was half off. Paid $180 for 2 tickets for premium C level seats. Definitely worth it."
Beatles Love,The most beautiful show Ive ever seen. I live for Classic Rock and grew up on this.. But you dont have to to appreciate the greatness of this show. Its a complete MASTERPIECE. Its Art. My Husband and I have seen it twice. I loved it so much the first time I cried at the encore out of pure emotion and excitement. Oh I just love it. If it didnt cost close to 300 bucks every time we see it I could watch it over and over! But lets be real.. Your ass gunna put that 300 bucks into a Slot Machine anyway. Might as well get some memories out of it instead! Can not recommend enough.
Beatles Love,"Who doesnt know The Beatles songs.  You must be living under a rock not to know.  I still recall the moment I heard the unimaginable about John Lennon.
That being said...
I was underwhelmed. Three stars perhaps Im over Cirque shows.  The latter part of the show held my attention more:)  I anticipated more, as Ive seen other Cirque performances. An hour in and I quite frankly was ready for the show to finish up. I didnt find the acrobatics flowing smoothly while suspended above.  Lets chat about the children in the white masks, creepy. I know the amount of reviews are highly rated of this show.  More than half the theater was empty.  The entire row in front of us was vacant.  To my left our entire row was empty. The entire row behind us- yes, empty. Yet, we had two people seated right next to us.  
Indeed we inquired about spreading out a bit- absolutely not we were told.  What prompted our question was the man directly to our right spoke the entire show. Nope, not in a whisper regular speaking tone.  Heard his every word Perfectly clear over the music.  I gave him a stare down a few times and yes!  I made mention about him speaking. He clearly had the me, me, me syndrome. As did his wife, her shoes were off (no socks) and she had them hanging over the seats in front of her.  I heard more of him than the show!
Ive been in attendance for various Cirque shows from the beginning.  Yes, these have been around well over a decade. Not sure if I would give this or any other Cirque show another go around.  As you can see from my pictures, I enjoyed the gift shop! By far more entertaining:)"
Beatles Love,"This show is Massive Epic, there are no bad seats! I like to always seat in a different spot as the dynamic multimedia is experienced differently depending on where you sit. Its a visual spectacular full of eye-candy everywhere you look on stage (or off) things are happening. As the storyline progresses  so much is going on. The outfits makeup costumes and dancing was spot on, they have a phenomenal bit where skaters are doing massive trick jumps and hitting trampolines on skates, and I adored how about mid-way through all the hi-energy things slow down and these 2 amazing robotic train like items cart in candles and then they do a whole here comes the sun bit, it was Magical and sounded calming and amazing,, after which the energy went back up and there was more stunts, Aerialists , lots of dancing on the stage and ladies on really neat old-timey fur-coats that  made it look like their heads were falling off cant explain you just have to see it, and at the end, there is an Explosion of Energy that Fills the Room (literally) It starts with Fabulousness and Ends with a Bang.. this is a Must Do Show in Vegas"
Beatles Love,"Hands down my favorite Cirque show of all time. We got seats in the lower 200 section and they were perfect. Id probably even go slightly higher next time, but the theater feels pretty intimate, I dont think theres a bad seat in the house. Will be coming back again soon, there was so much to see I think this one requires multiple viewings."
Beatles Love,"Living in Las Vegas for several years and not seeing the show earlier has been a mistake. I am a Cirque du Soleil fan and have come to really love their shows, their music, and their unique experience given to their guests. The show was unlike anything else Ive ever seen from Cirque. If you are a Beatles fanYou have to see the show. Its not so much about the show as it is hearing the music in a way youll never hear it anywhere else. The easiest way to describe it is the Beatles in 3-D. The show itself is very entertaining and very trippy 60s love you have to see the show. Its not so much about the show as it is hearing the music in a way youll never hear it anywhere else. The easiest way to describe it is the Beatles in 3-D. The show itself is very entertaining and very trippy 60s.  Go see it"
Beatles Love,You will have an amazing time even if you are not a Beatles fan.  My wife never heard of the Beatles and really enjoyed the experience. The production value was as even higher than I expected and I expected a lot. It was more engaging than I knew was possible and had a fun play with the songs. A must see for any Beatles fan and a worthwhile visit for everyone else.
Beatles Love,"With everything I have, I urge you: as musicians, as human brings, if you possibly can see this show, then GO! 

So beautiful, artistic, athletic, aesthetic... I was utterly transfixed. 90 minutes passed in a single blink. My friend and I literally sat on the edge of our seats. We laughed. We sobbed. We sang along. 

Take your beloved (or, failing that, your bestie) and GO!"
Beatles Love,Cirque du Soleil never disappoints! The music and times of the Beatles taking you on a psychedelic adventures. Youll be trippin to the sounds and sights of the 60s
Beatles Love,"Help!!  All You Need Is Love!  The Beatles LOVE Show-My all time favorite show on the strip. I have been to this show over 5 times and every time I see something new. So Amazing!! I Love It!!!

This show is located at the Mirage Hotel Casino. Featured in the movie Vegas Vacation This is where the Love show is at and the ambience is casual and cool.

I recommend getting there at least 30mins. early. That means you have given the ushers your tickets and you are deciding on what drink to get. I recommend Here comes the sun a tequila sunrise in a commemorative Beatles Cup a bit pricey like $20 or around that. You get a nice size drink and what the hay have something to remember the show by in addition to all the very cool memories. Plus the show is over a hour long and you might get thirsty.

This show has amazing energy and so many fantastic trapeze artists and acrobatics going on that you are bound to be smiling from ear to ear or be in complete awe for sure. Of course you will hear the Beatles music being played the entire time,but it is not being done by impersonators. The music is playing and the performers are putting on short stories, acts if you will. Cirque du Soleil is so amazing in almost everything they do in this show. With top notch performers it never disappoints. 5 star show :) Yay!!

 I cant wait to see the show again :) Now,every time I hear a song by the Beatles, I can picture the show and what was being done during that song. *smile... Ahh good times. 

We have been to Zumanity which was OK. I wouldnt go again, it just was not my thing. Mystere just irritated me with the big guy dressed like a baby. I dunno, I found it weird, grown man babbling like a baby in baby talk ,ugh, annoyed me and a waste of my time.*sigh Oh well to each their own, I guess.

In Las Vegas or coming to Las Vegas? Please check the times and schedule of The Beatles LOVE show as the performers do need their rest and take breaks. You will not be disappointed. Great energy, great fun. Have fun. Enjoy!!"
Beatles Love,"This show is a must for any Beatles fan! I watch LOVE everytime I go to Las Vegas. Incredible show with Beatles music set to a dream like theatrical, acrobatic, cinematic and whimsical imagery. It always brings me to tears when they play the song, something. It is quite magical. The theater is circular and the stage is in the middle so every seat provides a wonderful view. Treat yourself to this memorable experience... You will fall in love all over again with the Beatles..."
Beatles Love,"I cannot say enough about how amazing this show is! Its loud, its powerful, emotional, beautiful, reminiscent, colorful, psychedelic, you name it. We saw it when it first came out, and again this year with our kids. They were in awe! And are now fans of Beatles music. Best show ever. Highly recommend"
Beatles Love,"I have seen most of the Vegas Cirque du Soleils over the years and have thoroughly enjoyed all, but one of them.....the The Beatles LOVE is not that odd one. Although not as large scale a stage as the likes of CDSs such as O LOVE was no less fun, high energy, colorful, and exciting to watch. There were such awesome stage technology, character performances, and Beatles music.....oftentimes heart pounding.....wait a minute, that couldve been the awesome sound system you could actually feel in pounding on your chest. The performers were so incredibly skilled with every acrobatic and dance move that it just keeps you awed throughout. 

For those who thought there was no story line to this performance probably dont understand what the the production is all about. Its not a literal story like you may see at a movie. Its an artistic and loose interpretation of the Beatles life and times. Just because an abstract painting by Van Gogh doesnt look like a Mona Lisa doesnt mean it has no meaning or story behind it. Every work of art has a meaning behind it and CDSs The Beatles LOVE production is no different.

I had actually wanted to watch the show the day before and had asked our hotel concierge for help with the tickets. However, we were a bit too late and the prices were rather high just a few hours before the performance. According to him, prices will typically go up the closer it gets to the performance time. So we opted to go watch the show the following night. We had reserved a balcony seat for just over $100, but when we got to the theater, we were met at the door by the usher who informed us that they had closed the balcony section and that we would be re-seated at a much better seat closer to the stage....wow....a $200 seat for $100!.....then again, I have seen this done before when there are plenty of empty prime seats to fill.....our view of the stage and performance was absolutely awesome as we were literally just feet from the stage and could watch every detail up close. The only problem I had was that there is very little leg room for taller people and I was a bit uncomfortable with my knees pressing up against the back of the seat in front for the 1-1/2 hour performance.

The entire cast of characters, performances, effects, music all literally made me feel like I was in a dream. In fact, although Id never tried this it myself, I can only just imagine that this is precisely how it feels to be high on magic shrooms without actually having taken the stuff :)"
Beatles Love,"More like 3.5 Stars, and yes Im a Beatles fan. I was around to see them perform on the Ed Sullivan Show with my parents and 3 brothers. You could have called us The Black Beatles back in the 1960s. But I dont know, this was my second Cirque du Soleil show and I guess after all the hype through the years, I thought they were more superb with the acrobatic presentations then Ive seen. 

The music selections were no problem for me, since Im quite familiar with their catalog. But like one previous reviewer stated, too much clowning and antics, after what were quite serious moments. Like their Michael Jackson show though, which I was thoroughly disappointed with, the music is the best part of the performance. And I get it with the odd costumes; think Yellow Submarine, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour. But still somewhat of a let down. I probably wont need to see another Cirque du Soleil show anytime in the near future."
Beatles Love,"This was such a fun Cirque show! I am a dancer so I love a good dance spectacle. This Cirque was more dance-y than acrobatic so if youre looking for more crazy tricks, then Ka and O would probably be better. However, the music and the choreography was really awesome and had several wow moments with lighting and design!

I would definitely come back and see this show again from a different seat to get a different perspective!

I highly recommend!"
Beatles Love,Growing up with grandparents from Liverpool the Beatles have always been a staple in my life. This show most certainly did not disappoint it was a great show for starters and even better because it was around some of the Beatles greatest hits. Definitely worth seeing.
Beatles Love,"At least I got to see the free technical show in the afternoon.

Listen, the show looks absolutely great.  There are stage effects that absolutely make this show one of a kind with every possible enhancement imaginable just short of holograms.  There are speakers on every seat, a million different light fixtures, and a transformer-esque stage.  If it was approved by Ringo, Paul, and the daughter of George, you know youre in for a treat.

That is.....if the price is right.

The parts that can be problematic is the pricing and the customer service.  Perhaps not everybody is on the same page when it comes to sales, availability, and simple math.

We called the box office (or what we believed to be the direct place to purchase tickets).  There was a deal that offered us 3 seats next to each other in the 50s range.  Someway, somehow, after all the taxes and fees were added (which, from rough memory, included transaction fee and 9% sales tax), the total price ended up being about $321.  No joke, although we absolutely wish it was.  Realizing that all the extra charges basically doubled the price, we asked about the breakdown of the charges.  We were immediately told that she forgot what the prices were.  So, we cancelled the whole order immediately considering we werent being given any explanation why that was the cost.  The individual on the phone with us absolutely did not want to deal with us any longer, and she told us that if we want to purchase tickets, we need to see the box office in person for them.  Way to handle the transaction, and it honestly was the critical roadblock to us from watching the actual full show.

When we got to the theater box office in person, all we were offered were tickets as cheap as $110 each before taxes and fees.  We respectfully declined and ended up watching the Baz Luhrman show at The Mirage, which I think we enjoyed much more, given the circumstances.

So, the lesson to be learned at this moment in time concerning show ticket-shopping is that you will likely need to sit down and have a calculator ready when figuring out pricing because even the very ones who have control over what you pay will absolutely up-charge you without giving you an explanation.  But then again, thats Vegas for ya.

But there are ways to lessen the financial trauma.

1) If you happen to play the MyVegas game app through Facebook, you may unlock the deal for 50% off 2 regular tickets to the show for a mere 5000 loyalty points.  Once purchased, you are given a code to use at purchase online.  (And you must use this for online purchases, NOT at the box office in person.)
2) Costco offers e-gift cards on their website and/or mobile app.  For $80, you get $100-worth towards the purchase of tickets.  However, once you activate them, you will run into some complications if you happen to need to return them.

But in any case, dont even try to purchase tickets if youre on a tight budget."
Beatles Love,"Im a Beatles fan but this show was pretty boring. Luckily I attended for free, but if I had to pay for it it wouldnt be worth it."
Beatles Love,I LOVE Love! I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and went to see it for a second time. It was even better the second time around. There is so much to take in that I needed to see it again. The music and the show is perfectly choreographed. Its a feast for the senses. Everyone should see it once.
Beatles Love,"Cirque shows are always impressive and The Beatles LOVE does not disappoint. A phenomenal show with crazy-talented performers all set to some of the best music ever written and performed. My only issue was with the the people sitting behind us who talked throughout the entire show, and not about the show. Im guessing they must have had free tickets since they couldnt care less the show, nor being courteous to the people around them."
Beatles Love,"Easy....I love easy!!  I went on Vegas.com to find tickets for the Love - Cirque de Soleil show - found the seats I wanted at a reasonable price, Paid....went to the show...showed my tickets from my phone...bought some snacks...got to my seats...and Voila...enjoyed the show.  Found out later..I paid $50 less per ticket than my friend for tickets the next night.  Dont know where they bought theirs from but Vegas.com was a good purchase.  Seamless experience...will definitely use again when Im back in Vegas."
Beatles Love,"We loved the show!!, highly recommend it! Come early and watch the volcano at the mirage too!!"
Beatles Love,"Its swell.  But if you have very high expectations, lower them a bit and youll be happier.  

The show is lighter on jaw-dropping acrobatics than Cirque is famed for.  And it doesnt have much of a focus--most of the time theres so much happening on stage that its not clear what to focus on.  In the end it probably doesnt matter--the show leans heavy on the charm of the music and the Beatles chatter.

A friend of mine loved it because it allowed her to pretend she was at a Beatles concert.  I liked how they mixed all the songs and tidbits from various outtakes into one 90-minute flow. 

There are no bad seats, probably, but there are better seats than others.  My guess is the closer you are to the middle, or front-middle, the better.  If youre too close to the stage, you may be too close to get the effect of all the synchronization between the cast.  If youre too far, its fine, but you may lose out on some detail.  The middle seems to be a sweet spot."
Beatles Love,"I was nearly pulling my hair out trying to decide what Cirque du Soleil to see. Im convinced there are a lot of great options but had an inkling as someone who grew up with the Beatles, Id like this one. (I wouldnt say Im a die hard fan, but Ive heard many of these tunes more than 100 times, for sure.)

I agree with some of the reviews that there was a balance between dancing vs. acrobatics, but both were done very well. Some segments were perhaps a bit more mesmerizing, like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, but the whole show is very well choreographed. 

Im not sure I followed the story very well - is there a story? - but there are definitely some moments that are beautifully portrayed, like Lennons death. 

Luckily, no one around me was singing. (It was a concern of mine!)

No regrets in my decision to see this one. It sounds like this one is quite unique."
Beatles Love,"Most popular show in Vegas is hosted at The Mirage. This hotel is a Vegas icon because it was developed by Steve Wynn in 1989 which at the time was the largest hotel in the world. 

Alright onto the show itself, heres the the price breakdown of seats:

$196 Category A: Section 200s (first row K)
$168 Category B: Section 200s (middle rows)
$141 Category C: Section 100s (lower rows)
$113 Category D: Section 200s (last row R and S) and section 300s. 

Based on the pricing chart, MGM thinks section 200s has the best seats. Also never pay full price on a show. Check Mlife, Tix4Tonight, and coupons for deals. 

Its not like a NBA game where the lowest seats are the better seats. Alright m love?"
Beatles Love,"Its.. Okay. I love the Beatles, but I felt this show was like going to an old laser light show at the planetarium. Just music and a bunch of things dancing around.

There was not enough cool cirque stuff in this show, and too much dancing.
The production does not have nearly the wow factor from a technical standpoint, and the human talent did not have enough wow to make up for it.
So, you get an over priced, dance number, with a few acrobats thrown in.
Go see KA. Or O

There is also one character in Love that looks like Dr. Evil, and it makes no sense, is distracting, and in almost every scene."
Beatles Love,We came to Beatles Love for our anniversary date night.  Cirque and The Beatles whats not to love?  This was my first time seeing the show.  I know a few friends who are not happy with the updates to the show recently.  Since I didnt have anything to compare it to I wasnt disappointed.  I loved the show from start to finish.  You dont have to be a super fan to enjoy this show.  I like The Beatles but pretty much know the hits.  They did a great job.  Typical Cirque show where so much is going on.  Amazing stunts and beautiful imagery.  I think unless you really dont like The Beatles music will you enjoy this show.  I was a little distracted by the sheets of fabric separating the audience.  Eventually they came down but they blocked our view for a portion of the show.
Beatles Love,This was one of the very best live performances I have ever experienced.  The theater was actually designed for this show and it was spectacular.  My wife and I loved it!  You dont have to be a hardcore Beatles fan to love this.  I cannot recommend it high enough!
Beatles Love,"This show has been revamped. While it is still a really good show, it was much more superficial than the original show. Like so many prominent Las Vegas shows, they seem to be changing to entertain at the lowest common level of the culture. The original show was emotional and had depth. This one, not so much. If there was a story, it was impossible to follow. The music was great, and so was the dancing and acrobatics. The first time I saw it, I couldnt wait to come back. That was years ago. This time, even though it was fun, I couldnt imagine spending big bucks to see this show again."
Beatles Love,"Wow, what can I say without giving the show away?

I am aware of the Beatles and their contribution to pop culture, but was never a follower. The way they blend all generations through aerial acrobatics, costumes, props, and blend of musical hits is brilliant!

Theres no bad seat in the house, we sat in section 207. Though we missed out on some of the interaction between the stage actors and props, we had a nice view of the entire integration of acts.

Everyone should go see this CDS show! Weve been to Zumanity and Ka, and this is by far our favorite!"
Beatles Love,"Absolutely amazing show! I wish there would have been more acrobats like the O we had seen the day before, but the costumes were amazing and the setup of the stage was perfect to be able to see at every angle."
Beatles Love,"Beatles, Im there.  Cirque du Soleil, Im there.

Ive been to 6 different shows over the years, and Ive seen my last Cirque du Soleil show.  Not that I didnt like the music (although not live where others Ive see are), and not that I didnt appreciate the effort - great choreography, set design, and elaborate stunts and dancing.  In fact, there were a few moments where I said wow.  But it wasnt enough.  Frankly, I was just underwhelmed.

I dont get the clowning around mixed in with the serious.  Enough."
Beatles Love,"Definitely an entertaining show.  This was my 2nd time and I enjoyed it as much as the first time (its been a few years).   My friends also enjoyed it.  Seats were 4th row from the back but the theater is not that large so the views are still good.   Theres a short segment of the show where many people in the audience cannot see the performers (a large piece of material is billowing above their heads, blocking their view).   Our seats were just high enough so we could see over the fabric- it was a very interesting perspective so Im glad we were in those seats."
Beatles Love,"Ive obviously never been to a terrible Cirque show, but now I have been to another average show. 

Our Concierge prefaced the ticket purchase with the statement: This show is a busy body, that I can say for sure. Well, she wasnt joking, but I will get to that in a moment. 

As you walk up to the theater, in the circa 1994 hotel and casino that is The Mirage, you can see that money was spent on this theater and this Cirque production. The UK flag on the ceiling, as you approach the theater, and the shiny color changing lit up floor. Spectacular!!! The photo shoot that each guest has a chance to take part in, before you head inside? Smashing!!!

I do not reveal spoilers, even if a show has been in production for over a decade. I respect the Cirque experience and I want each ticket holder to be surprised when the show begins.

That said, this show was more musical than the standard Cirque acrobatic performance and thats fine. I just dont think The Beatles are my thing and that likely has more to do with my age group than anything else. I was a stoner, but the kinda stoners I ran with were more consumed with The Doors, Jimmy and Janis than The Beatles. 

I wanted to checkout an alternative Cirque production, but Michael Jackson was dark the days we were in town. LOVE was good, just not my cup of tea."
Beatles Love,This was seriously such an amazing show. We sat all the way to the top and had the most amazing time. I didnt feel like we missed out on a single thing. I may sound a little exaggerative because this was the first Cirque Ive ever seen but my boyfriend and I were just so amazed at every part of the show. The effects were awesome! The sound was super good it sounded like the speakers were right next to us (not in a bad way). It really truly felt like each Beatle was there with us. I would highly highly recommends his show to any Beatles fan out there!!!
Beatles Love,Fabulous show! So visually stimulating that my eyes didnt know where to look. The music was of course great. Just the right volume. The seating was perfect no matter where you are. There is one particular scene that I think benefits you if youre up high in the cheap seats. Although Ive never seen it from a lower perspective. We bought our tickets 3 months in advance and paid about 83 per ticket. Well worth it.
Beatles Love,This was absolutely fabulous. The tricks and dancing the music the atmosphere totally phenomenal
Beatles Love,This show is just amazing and entertaining.  Could not contain my excitement. Just pure fun. If ever youre in vegas this is a must see. I would watch it over and over again.
Beatles Love,"It has taken me TEN LONG YEARS to FINALLY see this, and it was spectacular, phenomenal, and so artistically creative.  WOWWWWWWWW!!!  Interesting to me that some Yelpers were disappointed, but they seemed to go with expectations, and the show did not reach whatever their expectations were.  Im amazed that after 10 years of this show being in existence that I didnt know anything about it, but I didnt, and I walked into the theatre-in-the-round with zero expectations.  Maybe thats better.  I dont know.  All I do know is that it was fantastic, wonderful, and when it was over, I teared up.  Seriously.  I just didnt want it to end.  My brother had been bugging me for all 10 years to see this show because he knows what a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge Beatles fan I am, and someone like me needed to see this show.  I now know why.  I want to see it again.  And again.  And again.  It was just so good.  Let me sum it up this way..... my daughter said she had ALMOST AS MUCH fun watching ME (and my husband) and our reactions as she had watching the show itself.  We, and especially I was like a kid in a candy store, and my exuberance, elation and sheer joy was very pure and child-like ....... in a good way, of course.  For all of you out there who havent seen it and want to / intend to...... I can tell you there isnt a bad seat in the house, and you will see from wherever you are sitting.  If you love the Beatles, seeing this show is a MUST.  TRUST ME ON THIS.  One last thing... you CAN take photographs...... you cant videotape, but still shots were allowed."
Beatles Love,"Another great show in the Cirque collection of shows. Beatles Love definitely has its own unique elements from the other shows. 

The theatre is round so that all seats are surrounding the stage. It didnt seem like there was a bad seat in the theatre except for maybe the couple of rows closest to the stage. The stage was uniquely shaped with moving parts to recreate the shape of the stage frequently. 

This is a Beatles show so obviously there is great music. The costumes were great and true to the era of Beatles music. The performers were energetic and came together for a great show. Every act included perfectly coordinated dancing which was fascinating. There werent any dull moments. 

One of the unique elements of this show was the audience interaction. I wont give away details to make it more fun for those that havent seen the show, but there are some fun ways that the audience is made to feel included. 

Since most of the Cirque shows include spectacular physical stunts it should be noted that this show includes very little of that. Beatles Love focuses more on dancing and music than the typical awe of Cirque shows. Its truly a great show, but it could be disappointing for those looking for the awe they experienced at shows like Ka."
Beatles Love,Incredible show. Im not a big Beatles fan but I can tell you from start to finish this show was great
Beatles Love,"I like Cirque shows, and I thought this one was pretty good. This show is a bit different than most of the other Cirque shows. They heavily use projections on the screen, but the effects are pretty nice.

There are some acrobatics here but I felt like a lot of the show was a mob of people on the stage running around dancing. It follows the rise of the Beatles to international fame, but theres a little bit of dialogue (by the Beatles themselves? Or impersonators) over the loudspeaker.

Theres one really cool scene that involves a gigantic sheet. For this reason, I recommend sitting in the back row to view the whole effect.

They play a bunch of different Beatles songs obviously so its a nice throwback to this wonderful band."
Beatles Love,"Amazing! This is my third Cirque du Soleil show Ive watched and they never disappoint. The staging, lights, and costumes made such an impact. And of course, its pretty much a sing along performance. What a great way to express the music and story of The Beatles."
Beatles Love,"LOVE is not your typical Cirque show.  I can understand why some people give it bad reviews.  The mystique, the stunning acrobatics, etc you expect with a Cirque show are not there.  I have to admit I enjoyed KA more, but this is a different experience. 

First and foremost, this show is a celebration of the Beetles.  If you love their music, youll love this show.  Although this show probably caters to an older generation, this show made me appreciate the music of the Beetles. It leaves a lasting impression on you and did a great job of interpreting their music into art/dance.

I enjoyed the show, there are some magical moments but a lot of it is just dancing.  I read a disappointed review of how this show looked like a high school musical.  Its partly true.  The show kind of tracks the evolution of Beatle music and does a great job of visually expressing some of their more psychedelic songs.

The Dolby sound is perfect, you do hear the Beatles in all their glory and the show got me tapping along.    

Final tip - there are no bad seats in the house."
Beatles Love,"BANANAS good.

This show is like seeing that very first Cirque show you ever saw. I have seen many - and was starting to think they were getting a bit complacent that they were sorta all the same.  THIS ONE was my favorite of all of them. I bet you could see it 10 times in a year and still love it - you would have to sit in different seats b/c they all have a unique perspective.

I cant describe it - just go. I cant help! (HA HA) but think that John Lennon would have loved it!"
Beatles Love,"This show is AMAZING!  I LOVE the Beatles, grew up on them...my folks had a lot of the albums.  My husband was cracking me up reading me some of the bad show reviews written by people that dont like the Beatles - why the hell would you come to this show if you dont like the Beatles?!? 

We came the day before to pick up our tickets, take pictures and shop in the gift store. And were extremely proud of our shrewd strategy since the night of the performance everything was a bit crowded. I had an awesome moment at the snack bar when dude asked me if I wanted a double wine in my commemorative Beatles plastic tumbler. Oh my, yes!  Who can refuse a Big Gulp of wine? Not I.

The show blends music, Beatles conversations, acrobatics, images and theatrics into a riveting performance.  It was especially sweet that there were two little kids sitting behind us so we got to hear all their awestruck comments and glee.  And they had little English accents - so cute!

$170.50 got us really good seats with a great view of everything. But the show was definitely not even close to sold out, so they may want to consider lowering the prices a bit to pack the house? 

Loved the show and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Beatles fan!!"
Beatles Love,We have seen them all and had high hopes for this especially given the content that they could draw from...fell short of the other shows in Vegas...other than the songs we were hard pressed to see the connection with the Beatles!
Beatles Love,Great show! Kid friendly! Music is great! Performance is great! No lulls in this show! Every seat in the house is great! No bad views!!
Beatles Love,WOW! This show was AMAZING! Thanks to everyone who put this wonderful production together. It made our special occasion an over the top experience. Definitely the highlight of our trip! It is an absolute spectacle. So many great performers and visual effects. Listening to the music of one of my all time favorite bands the whole time was the cherry on top. Sitting in the front row definitely made us feel part of the show. We loved the interactive performers/parts. This was the first  Vegas show for everyone in our party. We all want to see every cirque du soliel show now.
Beatles Love,"If you are a Beatles fan with 110 minutes and dollars to blow, all you need is LOVE.  

Ive gone twice, so I know that the cheapest seats on the very top are just as good if not better than the other seats.  Sit here, there, or everywhere-  but I prefer the top seats, which happen to be discounted.  Money CAN buy you Love.

The star of the show is the Grammy-winning mash-up soundtrack and production values.  Youll dig it."
Beatles Love,"The Cirque shows on the strip become a blur after awhile as almost all of them have: aerialists, contortionists, acrobats, clowns, unique stage, special effects, and music you may or may not understand.  For those not familiar with the Beatles, you will be lost in a daze...sort of like a Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds head trip.  But I guess that might have been their intent - LSD being the name of the song and the show centered around the hippy phase of the Beatles long, storied, history.  Do not expect the Bowl Haircut, Ed Sullivan version of the Beatles on this show, but do expect the 60s Free Love version of the Beatles.  You know, the psychedelic, bell bottom, big-hair version as typified by their Sergeant Pepper phase of their history.

Well let me start from the beginning.  The weekday shows will generally not be sold out and there are typically two per day when showing.  Weekend shows will be more of a challenge.  There is a 7pm for older folks and 9:30pm for less older folks.  Doors open a half-hour before the show and you always want to be there early in order to not get clowned.  Pricing options are: MLife members get around a 30% discount, a sometime available two-for-one deal through on-line Vegas Slots, sometimes half-price deals at the Mirage ticket office, or supposed same day cheaper tickets at the Strip discount ticket kiosks / booths.  So many ticket options, as in, so many dealers in Vegas.  In Vegas, someone is always dealing; albeit, card dealers, time-share free-show dealers, half-naked girly business card on the sidewalk dealers, etc...  Yeah, everyone has got some deal going on so check around before buying.

When making your deal or buying your tickets, try to sit higher than Row Q and in Sections 200 and 209 which are centered.  The stage is oval and seating is in the round or should I say oval.  You will want to sit further back to take in the entire spectacle.  Additionally, there is a point in the show where a large fabric covering is lowered to simulate the open sea and youll be pissed if youre sitting underneath this fabric in Rows P and lower.  Therefore, sit higher and enjoy this simulation...it is really one of the highlights.

If youve seen many Cirque shows, this one differs as there is a lot of dancing.  More like out of controlled dancing mayhem with performers situated all over the large stage.  A little too much like a church revival to me.  The show also has skaters and trampoline / net climbing acrobats.  Yes, there is employment hope for your out-of-controlled teen head banger.

Three nits... One - Lone Contortionist facing one direction for all of his moves.  Suggest turning a quarter, four times to allow the entire audience to enjoy your feats facing you.  Two - half of your audience is lost underneath the sea of fabric for the important boat-on-the-sea period of the show.  This portion of the show is a must-see and should be seen from above Row P.  Three - what were the kid performers supposed to be doing?  They really dont add any value and I kept expecting them to do something amazing other than run around.

Overall, worth seeing for the visual special effects and hearing Beatles music from their druggie phase of their lives."
Beatles Love,"When you go to Vegas, you see a show. Its just the way it is! But there are so many shows in Vegas to choose from, I didnt know where to start. I think we pretty much settled on a Cirque show since its sort of a Vegas classic. After watching a lot of Cirque trailers, I selfishly eliminated any with clowns (I am deathly afraid of them!). Then I asked my friend who lives in Vegas (and works for Cirque) for her recommendations. 

She had worked on Beatles LOVE before and highly recommended it. That sold it for me. We were seated in the 206 section, I believe and it was perfect. We were able to see everything without being too far from the stage. 

All of us really enjoyed the show - its stunning with a bit of humor. The music was on point and really great if youre a Beatles fan. The acrobats were absolutely awe-inspiring! There was so much going on the stage and in the air; It was so hard to pick which ones to watch! 

Highly recommended!!"
Beatles Love,"Wow, what an amazing show 
Im a huge Beatles fan but even if youre not I guarantee you will have a great time. Its almost impossible not to be impressed by the acrobatic skills preformed right in front of you. Ive seen this show 3 times and would see it again and again. Theres no bad seat in the house!! Definitely recommended checking this show out"
Beatles Love,"I love Cirque Du Soleil shows and have seen most. This is not a bad show but it wasnt good compared to others like KA, O, and even Mystere. The acrobats were ok but the rest of the show did not impress me personally. Would not be my first show suggestion."
Beatles Love,"My take on this show? Where IS the love? If you havent seen it yet, save your money. 

UNLESS YOU LOVE watching people in Austin powers and KKK costumes dancing around, (seriously what was the point of having white supremacists spin Barney-style alongside good, happy people? Or having the unwed pregnant African American woman &amp; her baby daddy mostly walking around in the show?) 

IF YOU ADORE seeing people driving around cars that go .5 mph, and wig-wearing women bouncing up and down on bungee cords for hours (some of them-- specifically The glowy things from Octopuss Garden-- utilized NO SKILL whatsoever. They literally looked DEAD)

IF YOU Have a NEED to BURN your hard earned money and your precious time, then THIS is YOUR SHOW.

Beatles Love has NO storyline, or feeling WHATSOEVER. Its ALL over the place. Parts of it actually made me feel uncomfortable and NOT in a good way. NOT the best cirque weve seen, and weve seen O, Ka, Mystere (3x), Zarkana, La Nouba (in FL), and MJ One so far.

If you want to see a show with chart topping music, go watch MJ One instead. Awesome story, feeling, stunts, diversity, and LOVE over THERE.

(And yes, we are Beatles fans.)

Our family of 7 paid huge $$$ to be bored. 2 stars only because our kids liked the bubbles. (That says a lot if thats what they liked best.)

ETA: I strongly believe many of these five star reviewers are either getting PAID to write them, or are getting something from someone for free. NO WAY could anyone like this show that much."
Beatles Love,"This show is far and away the catchiest, most innovative and hypnotic stage show I have ever seen.  Whether you are a fan of The Beatles or not this show is a MUST SEE in my opinion.  

The Mirage is home to the spectacle that is LOVE and by having this show performed in the round is absolutely brilliant.  The round stage offers a remarkably good view to all guests no matter what seat you purchase (although their is one minor interactive element exclusive to those who sit closer during the show but I wont spoil it).  The music is prefect and covers songs throughout the entire Beatles catalog of music and the story flows seamlessly throughout.  For those saying this has less high gravity and death defying acts than your normal Cirque du Soleil show is fair perhaps but the show definitely still deliver in this aspect as well.  There is so much going on at one time it is sometimes hard to keep up with it all and you go into overload mode but in a good way.

The Beatles have had such an impact on many peoples lives in one way, shape or form and for me their music resonates big time in me and is often playing loudly in my head.  I enjoyed the entire show but the several of the scenes such as Hey Jude and Lucy in the Sky really stood out above some of the rest.  The show will take you through the entire gambit of emotions as you embark on the roller coaster ride that is this show.  You will feel the happiness and joy that many songs convey one second while being brought back down into a more somber, melodic and melancholy feel the next.  The show moves at a breakneck pace but never fails to keep you thinking and watching at every turn.  

The special effects and props used were done to absolute perfection and really have to be seen firsthand to be believed.  They did an excellent job of weaving in world events and other periods of Beatlemania into the story which really gave the show a complete feel.  The Beatles are one of those bands who like them or not whose music will be around forever and will continue to resonate with people in different ways.  They truly were a once in a lifetime band that will love on forever and this show is a perfect homage to them.  If you are in Vegas and looking for a show this would definitely top my list.  Beatles and non Beatles fans alike will fall in LOVE with this show (pun intended)."
Beatles Love,This is the second time Ive seen this show and it is mesmerizing.  I love it because its all the cool acrobatic stuff typical of cirque du Soleil but it has great and familiar music to go along with it.
Beatles Love,"We had no intentions to see a show this trip to Vegas....then we said what the heck. Tried to get into see the Michael Jackson ONE, but the show was off that week. At the recommendation of the ticket sales at the Mandalay Bay we opted for the The Beatles - LOVE show. Our tickets sales gal was great and she suggested to sit higher up due to the great effects during the show. So off we went to the Mirage ...had a lil dinner first, then saw the HUGE line. Doors open about 40-30 minutes before show time, so we casually waited at the bar near by as the line slowly dwindled down. Once seated you can see how the stage is sorta circular and I would say there is no bad seat in the house. The performers come out and mingle a bit with the crowd before the show, which is funny and entertaining - made the waiting time pass quickly.

If you are a Beatles fan, you will be singing the whole night.....if you are not and do not know of the era the show might be a little confusing. The story line follows the Beatles musical Sgt. Peppers Lonely Heart Band; in which tells the story of a band as they wrangle with the music industry and battle evil forces on stealing their instruments and corrupting their home town of Heartland. It shows how tragic their era was, wanting peace then the protesting and of course wanting love. Really touching, heartbreaking, yet very heartwarming.

Kudos to our ticket sales gal.........the higher seats you can see when it comes to the middle part of the show.......a little SPOILER ALERT (they wave a big parachute like blanket for an effect and it covers the middle to bottom seats - and those seats cannot see! That part and the effect and was incredible and really nice from above! We were in row 208. The performers were fantastic, as the effects and acrobatics up above. Costumes were awesome - you will love this show!"
Beatles Love,"Been wanting to come for years, so happy to say this was one of my bucket list experiences that exceeded my dreams! Wether you love the Beatles or Cirque du Soleil, you will Love this show. And if you are a fan of both, youll be blown away! I will come see this again it was so much fun!"
Beatles Love,"Im a Beatles fan from way back.  I remember watching Hard Days Night as a kid of 9ish and asking my mom if The Beatles were a real band with real fans that were that crazy or not?  I remember my mom getting a very serene smile on her face as she humored my  innocent music questions.  Since then I have listened to The Beatles to help with everything from heartbreak to insomnia.   There isnt another band that can fit every mood and time of my life like The Beatles.  I was very excited that this show existed and I was very anxious to try and fit the show into my last trip to Vegas.  Lucky for me they were also had a discount ticket deal going on when I was looking for tickets.   
1. There is no bad ticket!  I could have been in the cheap seats and had as good a view as my mid range tickets offered.  I would actually say dont get the seats right up front as there is way too much going on to take it all in from those seats.
2.The music is great, how could it not be :)
3. the dancing, acrobatics, story line are all great
4. I would see it again"
Beatles Love,"Arguably my FAVORITE of the Cirque shows Ive seen.

The best way to describe it... I very much didnt like the Beatles, but after the show, I cannot get enough. I will say I laughed, and was wowed, but I really cried quite a bit. This show is just an experience and has a lot of great statements about the past but also about this time. My review will never give this show justice. Please go watch and support, you WILL NOT be disappointed.

This is my favorite Cirque show, and its coming from a guy who really didnt like the Beatles beforehand. GO WATCH NOW!!!!!!! WATCH THIS SHOW IF THERES ONLY ONE THING YOU DO IN VEGAS!!!!!"
Beatles Love,"I like The Beatles, but I dont love them. They were basically the first boy band and their songs didnt start getting good until the band members slowly went crazy. Whatever. Thats besides the point.

LOVE is a really entertaining show. Although it lacks a lot of the physical feats that Cirque shows have come to be known for, it more than makes up for it through innovative stage concepts. The stage, lighting, choreography and attention to detail make this one of the best live performances Ive ever seen. It contains beautiful segments that feature animation, dance, and really crazy costumes. On more than one occasion, I actually said, no way out loud. I never, ever do that unless some cataclysm has occurred or they mess up my order at Chipotle.

If you wanna see superhero-style strongmen hold one another up on their abs or something, go for Absinthe or one of the other Cirque shows. Like KA, the stage is just as much of a performer here (which is cool for me but it might not be your thing).

protip - its a theatre in the round and the higher seats are way better than the ones close to the action. Trust me on this one. Go for the cheap seats."
Beatles Love,"This was so beautiful I wish it went on forever!  Do make sure you go to the bathroom first because you totally are not going to want to leave to take a break at all!!

I HAD to go BUT realized it would be too high profile for me to walk out during the show.  The show makes use of EVERY part of the theater they can, including drawing the audience in and making them feel a part of it which is genius in and of itself.  

Without being a spoiler let me just say the Beatles wrote MORE than you probably even knew or recall!  A total treasure a must do while in Vegas!

The Buffet at the Mirage was excellent as I had dinner there prior to the show.  EVERY PERSON that worked at that buffet THANKED us for our BUSINESS and not one other buffet went out of their way to smile and make sure we knew were appreciated.  This blew my mind!  Even the garbage taker outers all the way to the CHEF made sure they thanked us when we THANK THEM!!!  The food was great and I rank the Mirage Buffet top 3 Buffets in Vegas.  Aria being #2 and Wynn being #1

But I will stay at Mirage next time I go to Vegas...because also the lobby was breathtaking and it all was entering a beautiful story like atmosphere.  Very calming and aquariums and plants everywhere and very tastefully designed.  Thank you Mirage!"
Beatles Love,"Wow! 

I have never been to a Cirque du Soleil show before seeing this one, but if theyre all this amazing then I need to see every one. Ive always wanted to see one when theyve come into town, life just always gets in the way. 

Anyway, I found myself in Vegas with a couple friends to celebrate a 30th birthday. You need to see a show in Vegas, right? They are all huge Beatles fans, and while I certainly like some Beatles songs, Ive never been super into them. So they picked the show and I figured it would be great, but it really blew away any expectations I had.

I was so wowed by everything. There are sad parts, there are fun and happy parts, there are crazy parts, there are parts where you want to run on stage and start dancing. There wasnt a boring moment. Ive never been so upset about a show coming to an end, why couldnt it just go on all night?! We had 3rd row seats, so we were able to see every detail. There were a few instances where the performers came right up to us in the aisle, which was always a hoot. 

Whether you adore the Beatles or only know a song or two, go see this show!"
Beatles Love,Saw this show several years ago and it is completely different. Awesome both times... Totally worth the price
Beatles Love,Simply amazing.  The best concert I have ever scene.  The stimulation was unreal.  The acorbatics was out of the world.  I would definitely see this again.  Certainly a must see if you.come to Vegas!
Beatles Love,"This was my first cirque show and I was utterly captivated and blown away.  It was amazing and worth every penny.  As many have said, the theatre is round so theres no bad seats, acoustics and visuals were all amazing.  Special effects, set, costumes, choreography are all breath taking.

Concessions are insane - I paid $54 for 2 margaritas and a popcorn.  $54!!!! And the margaritas were gross (and Ive had my share of margaritas!) merch in the store is equally harrowing to the credit card with shirts going $40+! 

Go see this.  I was a bit meh about cirque but came out a believer!"
Beatles Love,"Just saw the show, seated in the 300 section. I was not impressed. I think there has to be better shows than this. Especially for what we paid for the tickets. The theater is in an odd shape that adds no value to the effects. Hope this helps."
Beatles Love,"No LOVE for the Beatles at the Mirage in Las Vegas.  Unless youre a hard-core Beatles fan, you will find this mildly entertaining at times and trying to stay awake the rest.  Its low on the acrobatics youd come to expect from a Cirque du Soleil production.  At first, Id thought that I accidentally stumbled in to an off-Broadway revival of Hair, with its way over-done tribute to the 60s and 70s.  

Then there is a VERY weird and pretty dark segment that can only be described as anti-Christian.  With a horned devil-like trapeze artist and a Cross surrounded by fire and screeching hell-like noise.  

There are a couple of really beautiful adagio numbers that try to off-set the rest of the blah-blah attempts at comedy and repetitious tricks.  But mostly, I was bored!  And not just our group.  There was a prevailing lack of energy in the room and the whole audience could sense it.  

Save your 160.00 and go see something else."
Beatles Love,"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.-With A Little Help From My Friends, Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  Its been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  Theres a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I wont spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up peoples arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing peoples reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds &amp; the act featuring Strawberry Fields Forever.  Very touching.  I didnt care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  Im talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money &amp; time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great &amp; we saved a lot of money.  Im generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic &amp; colorful show."
Beatles Love,"This was by far our worst Vegas experience.  In fact, after multiple trips to Vegas I can safely say it was our very first disappointment.  Weve been to multiple Cirque du Soleil shows so we thought we knew what to expect.  LOVE was nothing close to the other Cirque shows.  It was a chaotic display of boring randomness that lulled us to sleep.  We couldnt even bring ourselves to politely clap for the performers who Im certain were all tremendously talented.  Save your money, take a nap in your hotel room with The Beatles music playing in the background."
Beatles Love,"By far my favorite Vegas show.  Ive seen most of the shows in Vegas.  The music in this show is what makes it.  The physical feats are not as impressive as others, the the focus is on the legendary music of The Beatles, and Im so glad that the music isnt changed, re-performed, or remixed.  The story line is moving, in that it travels from post WWII England into the 60s.  It flows so well, and the performers love the music which shows. I love that this show feels much more immersive than other shows in Vegas.  The section from Abbey road was very well done."
Beatles Love,This was incredible! I LOVE the Beatles and I felt that they would have love the artistic take on their music! Everyone should experience this at least once! I intend to go back as much as possible!
Beatles Love,"All You Need is LOVE!!
This was a fun show! I was sad when it ended!
I dont think that you could have had a bad seat in this establishment, whether you were up front or in the higher seats, it is all good seating.
I loved the music and the dynamics of the show. You were taken through each era of the Beatles! I loved the music combined with Cirque du Soleil creativity and acrobatics.
Do not miss this show if you are in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"MY FIRST CIRQUE DU SOLEIL &amp; LAS VEGAS SHOW

Growing up I wasnt a Beatles fan. That changed several years ago when I saw VH1s Greatest 100 Rock &amp; Roll Albums. I noticed that five of the Beatles albums were in the Top 11 (#1 Revolver, #6 Rubber Soul, #8 Abbey Road, #10 Sgt. Pepper, #11 White Album). Surprisingly Chuck D of Public Enemy said his favorite Beatles album is Revolver. He also said what makes a great album is that not every song is a hit song. When I started listening to those albums I understood what he was saying. What made the Beatles great wasnt that they wrote great songs, but they created great albums, which is considered a lost art in todays music.

I didnt know what to expect from this show. Ive never seen a Las Vegas show before. My boss saw this show a few years back and didnt like it. I havent seen any Cirque du Soleil show but I wasnt sure if I would like the theatrics from the show. Also I wasnt sure if contemporary dance will be performed. Being someone whos fan of hip hop dance Im not particular fond of contemporary dance. Also I heard there was montage or collage of Beatles songs meaning a whole song will not be fully played. I set myself for low expectations.

After watching the show I was blown away. Without detailing every song or moves, for those who are interested in watching the show, I will depict the highlights. I love the mood in the opening scene of Liverpool in WWII. For the song I am the Walrus there were some hip hop and b-boy moves. In sense I was shocked for this show to see a lot more b-boy moves like lock and pop as I assume the dance form for this show would be contemporary dance. Even though Im not a fan of contemporary dance for the song Something there were b-boy moves yet the emotion felt through the dance moves had a contemporary dance vibe to it. If I had to summarize the choreography of the whole show there were mixtures of hip hop and b-boy moves yet there was an emotional contemporary dance feeling to it.

In terms of acrobatics there was guy on a swing that was raised high in the roof. The acrobatics he did without a cable and safety net astonished me. If youre afraid of heights you will be aghast what he was doing. Ill be honest for those who are interested in more Cirque du Soleil acrobatics this show doesnt have a lot of them. This show is more about the choreography through Beatles songs. What is amazing is that the later Beatles songs werent meant for dancing in clubs like todays music. Their songs had pure emotion. What makes this show entertaining is the choreography telling a story through The Beatles songs. 

Ive performed in several hip hop showcases. The reason I was blown away after watching this show is seeing the timing of the choreography of this show amazes me because I know how much the time these dancers put in. To get the timing and sequence right, if done correctly, makes the show entertaining. That takes a lot of practice. 

You know are enjoying a show when you dont have to look at your watch to hope and see when the show will end. Never once had I looked at my watch while I was watching this show. 

Picking a Cirque du Soleil show can be difficult. I recommend picking a theme that interests you. If you love the Beatles then you will love this show."
Beatles Love,"We LOVEd this show, we saw it for the first time 8 years ago and it was completely different this time.  Its been updated and is even more gorgeous, brilliantly colorful and emotional than the first time.  I actually gasped several times at the beautiful interpretation of these classic Beatles songs.  The dancers and acrobats are amazing, incredibly talented.  The theater and sound system are top notch.  Even the gift shop on the way out is unique and fun to explore.  Ive seen several Cirque shows and this is by far our favorite.  A must see when in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"It was a huge let down, and maybe its because Im not a fan of the Beatles nor do I know anything about them...

The stage is so dark and the music is so monotone that it was like a lullaby.  Needless to say, I slept half of the time.
Also, the acrobatics were so mediocre compared to KA that it felt like watching those circus solelis that travel around the US that are just sub-par.

I recommend KA to everyone and save $$$ on watching this show."
Beatles Love,I absolutely loved it. Was a very thoughtful and inspiring performance. We got seats 3 rows away from the stage and there were multiple times we felt as though the performers would fall in our laps. Would highly recommend to anyone.
Beatles Love,"If you love the Beatles youll enjoy the show, even if you dont.  A typical cirque du solei presentation full of Aerial feats matched to music.  It has moments of awe and inspiration.   A nice production."
Beatles Love,"Ive been wanting to see this for about 10 years now.  Fortunately for me my girlfriend wanted to see it too and was willing to buy the tickets.  We got there early, walked around the overpriced gift shop, and then found our seats.  I was hoping to get the Love vinyl for less than the record stores usually have it, but I was out of luck.

The show started and the music was phenomenal.  The tricks were your usual Cirque du Soleil, which are of course amazing.  The props and set were very well done.  The show lasted around 2 hours and I was impressed with it the whole way through.

The soundtrack is really good.  Any Beatles fan will love it.  Definitely worth seeing!"
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show I ever saw and WOW is all I can say! 

There are no words! The show keeps you entertained the entire time, and youll quickly find yourself singing along and having a blast! The show is super trippy and the action on stage is breathtaking! Since first seeing this show I have seen it three more times, and it is just as good each time!! 

A MUST SEE!!"
Beatles Love,"If there were 20 stars, I would give this 20 stars... This is the 3rd time Ive seen the show.. It is worth every penny.. The props, costumes, music, lighting are all fantastic. The performers are the best in any show we have ever seen... Truly a great show. I have had seats closer to the stage and middle and up high... All views were wonderful.. Its not a super long show..but it is jammed full. The best part of our trip to Las Vegas.."
Beatles Love,"HIGHLY recommended. I have seen that show eight times and I still love it. I take everyone who comes to visit me as a tourist to the show. This is THE BEST circus do Soleil show Ive seen out of all of them. I love the price, I love the waiting area, the staff,  the smell of the theater, how hyped up it makes everyone in the audience. I didnt know anything about the Beatles but after seeing the show I absolutely love the music. Absolutely stunning performance."
Beatles Love,"Loved the show we are a fan of the Beatles. The show was amazing.Wish it was longer.The dancers ,acrobatics were all great."
Beatles Love,"This show was absolutely entertaining and fun!

Our seats were close to the stage so we participated in a small portion of the show.

The Man is a fan of the Beatles so he was jammin the entire time!

I would love to come back and see this show again!"
Beatles Love,"I have seen several Cirque du Soleil shows and most have intense acrobatic routines which I love.  This show didnt have as much acrobatic routines but the music is fantastic, the visual effects and costumes kept me engaged so mission accomplished!  If you are not a Beatles fan this may not be the show for you."
Beatles Love,"Ive seen many Broadway musicals and this show is competitive! The imagery shows that the choreographer and art/prop/music production teams really get it. There are so many clever overt and nuanced points and the production is riveting. I loved it better than Ive loved any other show for years! Even if I werent a huge Beatles fan, I wouldve loved this!"
Beatles Love,"Ive been wanting to see this show for years and finally got to see it last week. Best Vegas show ever!! A must see for Beatles fans. The music, choreography, costumes, characters, acrobats, &amp; visuals all amazing!! Two seats in section 206 Row P $214.56 (including tax &amp; fees). I would recommend sitting lower than row P because I couldnt see both screens just one on the right side due to a high wall divider. Might not be a big deal to some but Im weird and wanted to look both ways. The skits during each song had a meaningful story &amp; made you reflect on that time period. The strawberry fields 32oz drink $24 from the bar was strong and hit the spot. The photos as you walk in will remain cherished for years to come $45, so buy them! Oh and dont forget to stop by the gift shop. Bought two quality t-shirts $60. I would definitely see the show again. Spending quality time &amp; making memories with your teenager....priceless!! OXOXO"
Beatles Love,"I am sure my review will be redundant, but this has got to be one of the best shows I have seen.  And I have seen Broadway, LA, and so on.

I guess if you arent a Beatles fan this may not be the show for you, but if you arent a Beatles fan you are probably chronically unhappy anyway.

I dont really want to share too many details and cause spoiler alerts, so I will mostly say that Cirque adding a show that has skaters in it is genius.  Add to that the staging and story they build out of the Beatles musical catalog will have you laughing, crying and ooing and ahing.

Expensive?  Yeah, but Vegas so...

Worth it?  DEFINITELY!

Also, family friendly!  A big change from most Cirque offerings."
Beatles Love,"The only thing negative about the show was that I wasnt high on something before coming to the show. If you are an antique Volkswagen, Beatles, or alcoholic lover you will find this show fascinating. Get buzzed before coming to the show."
Beatles Love,This show was amazing. The time choreography to the classic Beatles songs. The way the performers transitioned from one set to another were flawless. I was so engaged in everything around me. I would definitely recommend to others and watch more shows like this.
Beatles Love,"I enjoy the Beatles music!  But this production was kind of depressing. A lot of loud commotion!
Pounding! Loud annoying music and sounds!
Save your money and listen to the Beatles on pandora,
I gave it a 2 stars because the skaters was the best part!"
Beatles Love,"LOVE this show! Enjoyable Beatles music, glimpses back to 40s war, 50s rebuilding, 60s pop culture, 70s to 90s love, sensuality and even loneliness themes played out in dance and music. 

Small theater with all round good seats. Front row for close up intimate view of dancers and acrobats flying over head. Back rows to see full stage esp acrobatic feats. 

Talented dancers, acrobats, performing with individual artistry and flair to well-loved Beatles music makes for an enjoyable evening night out."
Beatles Love,"Love the many different Beatles songs, and very colorful really cool show. No singing and not as acrobatic at the other cirque du Soleil shows."
Beatles Love,"Love this show. Its one of the better cirque shows thats good for all ages -- my mom loved it as much as we did. The music is great -- but even for non Beatles fans, you can appreciate the acrobatics, etc. The Venue is one of my favorites -- its set up in such a way that there really isnt a bad seat. So you can get cheaper seats and still see well. They allow photos, but no videos, so you can capture cool photos from your show."
Beatles Love,"How to combine a legendary band with an exceptional acrobatic act - I had seen Cirque du Soleil (CdS) and found their performance to be exceptional. Beatles...no comment is needed at all. I wondered how these would be integrated to produce something even better together.  Integration of Beatles music to the performace was nice, but it lacked a coherent story line. It is as if each piece of Beatle love songs stood alone. I felt that integration of the music could have been better. In the beginning, the performance was almost too overwhelming with a hectic pace of performance, but I locked in with the rhythm within two songs. I especially fell in love with a dance between a male and a female dancer (I think, to the tune of Something). Despite seemingly disjointed songs, I loved each individual act and loved the energy of CdS. I didnt care for one performance of portrayal of the violence and racial tension, but I concede that it is relevant to the 60s. 
Dancers and performers were top notch. The set was impressively detailed and intimate. The physical performance was brilliantly choreographed and dazzlingly executed. I loved the experience, and this performance made me want more. Exceptional performance. Bravo!!"
Beatles Love,"Roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour!  The plot for the entire performance was fairly close to none, but they did try to bring to life the characters of some of the songs that were played.  From Eleanor Rigby to Fr. McKenzie to Lucy to Jude to Mr. Kite to Julia to Sgt. Pepper...  Then theres the Octopuss Garden, too.  Oh what joy for every girl and boy!

The show was relatively short at about 1:30, but it was enjoyable nevertheless.  For me, this was more of a celebration of the music of the Beatles rather than the colorfully clad acrobats doing their act.  Several tracks were remixed and mashed up and as a fan of their music, I could say that I found them refreshing.

The vignettes about the Fab Four were absolutely cool.  I thought they could have used more of those and maybe stretch out the show to about 2 hours.  Not to mention the numerous Beatles songs to choose from.  Overall, there seemed to be some misses here and there, but it all works out; It doesnt matter much to me...  Strawberry fields forever..."
Beatles Love,"With a heavy heart I lob two stars off this show.  Its A-OK but no longer a must see religious experience.   As many veteran fans of this show are suggesting -- someone broke Beatles LOVE.

The original version made me cry before the majesty and beauty of the show.  A strange dream inside a dark corner of the Yellow Submarine.  Where nothing was real.

To be fair I saw that version about 5 times.  The last time I looked at my partner and said, Well... weve seen it, havent we?  I never see any shows that often (or even twice) but the original Beatles LOVE earned these return visits.  It was really that good.  One of the best shows of anything on the planet.

This new version... is broken.  

Was too much changed?  No.  But enough?  Yeah.  Ive seen this version twice now.  The changes didnt grow on me.  I cant name one that was an improvement -- except for seeing the many African American faces during Blackbird.  And Beatles faces everywhere.  But even the Beatles mugs were ruined by lowering down TV screens here and there which is an aesthetic anachronism.  A show thats set in several pre-digital periods shouldnt be invaded by post digital tech.

In general Id say the new production boldly tries to fix sleepy parts of the original show.  Why do I say sleepy?  Because as the years went on I discovered (much to my shock) certain drunken audience members snoozing away around song 5 or 6.  SLEEPING.   Which is NEVER good. 

So I believe Cirque decided to insert alarm clocks.  TWIST AND SHOUT, for instance, was added to keep things peppy.  Several problems.  Its just shoved between two songs that are already up and bouncy, rendering it ineffective in this department.  It was simply in the wrong place.  Also its not even a Lennon and McCartney song.

LADY MADONNA used to be a very clever and fun dance number.  The dancing became simplified and the floor comes to life with projected splotches of color.  What was a fun and exciting change the first time became a Disney broad brush stroke.  And therein --

-- lies the problem with this Beatles LOVE.  Every change bashes you in the head.  Like those ludicrous spinning things in OCTOPUSS GARDEN.  All the subtlety of the first show jack-hammered away.   

Dont believe me?  Someone added HUGE pink balls that are suddenly thrown at the audience.  Like giant beach balls were invited to toss them about.  Again a way to force the audience to remain attentive while the explanation of which is baffling.  It comes off as desperate and distracted.

And while all these obvious changes to the veteran stare you in the face -- subtle changes irk.  Is it just me or did they let about 7-12 cast members go?   That the new faces arent just new faces but are doubling up to save the show money?  I swear Mr. Kite was missing half the circus folk it used to have.  It used to be intricate and clever.  It seems sparse now.

I appreciate that change is good.  And necessary.  This last viewing it occurred to me that any young people in the audience would have no real idea why the Volkswagon bugs and bus come and go.  For me its memory lane but for them they might wonder why were in a vintage VW showroom.  Way too much of that.  They should all come and go in one song and then bye bye.

Cirque.  You broke one of the best shows on the planet. 

Fix it."
Beatles Love,"Im really not much of a Beatles fan. Their music is great, but lets just say that I prefer other genres ;). That being said... the show was absolutely FANTASTIC!

It was my first experience with Cirque Du Soleil, but later Ive seen O so I have something to compare it to. Here, the stage was situated in the middle of the podium and seats were all around it. Because of this, the visibility was great no matter where you sat. As far as I know other performances do not have such an advantage.

Of all the shows on the Strip. LOVE is probably the one with the least acrobatics. Still, there are a lot of aerials, climbing, trampolines and roller skating tricks :). What it has instead is great music and a great story with the historical and pop-cultural background. The classic Beatles songs are arranged in a new way to match special effects and changing of the sets. Nearly every song is carefully created and separate peace of art with beautiful choreography and amazing performances, my favorite being Strawberry Fields Forever and Here Comes The Sun. And the giant tent effect - wow! Definitely great to see!"
Beatles Love,"Let me put this out there right now:
Im not a Beatles fan.   I dont mind their music, but I dont own a Beatles Album...in fact, I prefer covers of Beatles Songs.

That being said, my husband and I had the opportunity to go see LOVE this weekend...and I really enjoyed myself!  

The theater is in the round, which is a first for me with Cirque Du Soleil.  Ive seen 4 of their other shows on the strip, and have never seen an in the round performance before...I thought it worked really well. 

This show seemed, to me anyway, to be much more dancing, and less acrobatics.  There were still plenty of acrobatic acts:  aerial/tissue, rope climbing, trampolines, and these AMAZING roller blade tricks!!  It seemed to be more focused on dancing to the music though, and I liked it.  

Im a huge Cirque du Soleil fan, so I knew that the quality of the performances would be second to none.  

Hats off to the performers, you all did an incredible job!

The theater staff was great too.  Everyone was very friendly, and cracked jokes with us.  

My issue:  the seats are not comfortable.  They are SUPER close together and cramped.  Other theaters chairs seem just a touch bigger, and not quite as cramped together.

That issue aside, I would highly recommend the show, Beatles fans or not.  It was extremely well done, and I would LOVE to see it again."
Beatles Love,"This is going to be short and sweet. I have seen 5 different Cirque shows, and just saw O May -18. They are all good but absolutely loooved Love the best."
Beatles Love,"Weve seen about a half dozen Cirque shows now.  By far the best was O.  This one was somewhere in the bottom half.  It was good, but had a lot of choreography and not much of the amazing stunts that other shows have.  It was pretty trippy.  Like being on acid without the actual drugs..."
Beatles Love,"This was the only show we went to while at Vegas, as Im not the type to drop a ton of dough on shows like this. 

We had the nose bleeds seats and paid a lot for them. Still, we were able to see everything quite well. The show is about 90 minutes and uses a ton of Beatles songs. Its like any Cirque du Soleil, but with Beatles songs!

The show started off as a mess and was really chaotic, but kept getting better and better and I felt truly inspired by the time it was over. At first I was slapping myself thinking I had wasted a hundred bucks, but by the end it felt like it was truly worth it. I dont want to give away much of the experience, but you really should check it out, especially if youre a Beatles fan."
Beatles Love,Simply spectacular! Would recommend it to anyone. Such an amazing experience watching such talented artists. We had such a wonderful time. I would see it again!
Beatles Love,"I love this show so much. I loved everything about it. The price was good, but the taxes and other fees of course made it more expensive but worth watching."
Beatles Love,"Love LOVE. Im from post-Beatles generation but obviously recognize their genius. The show is amazing in every respect: music, performance, special effects. The audience was gasping, laughing, crying... It was beautiful. 

The show is family-appropriate. And all generations can appreciate it. Ive only seen two other Cirque shows so not a coonosier by any means. But, it seems that production values are very high as only in Vegas the whole stage is built specifically for the show and its not a temporary installation. Other places pale in comparison."
Beatles Love,"Love, love, LOVE!! A literal dream come true watching this show. Ive been a huge Beatles fan as long as I can remember and was so stoked when my mom bought me the tickets. I cried more times than Ill admit, but they were happy, mesmerized tears. The effects of the show are amazing in itself, plus the performers skills were seriously so amazing. Ill see this show a billion times more.. and then a bit more."
Beatles Love,While in Las Vegas last week - I saw this show and o.  This show was certainly entertaining and I enjoyed that they got the audience involved in the show - I would have to say it was probably my one of least favorite of all the Cirque shows Ive seen.   Not because it was bad or lacked entertainment - but I would say if HAVE to be a Beatles lover to truly appreciate the era this show is trying to represent.  We bought these tickets the day of the show at one of the discounted ticket vendors which was also convenient but I did feel it was a little long - and unfortunately my boyfriend fell asleep twice!  The staging was great and I did like that the stage was centered in the middle of the auditorium - there were however a lot of empty seats!
Beatles Love,"Im not sure how to rate this. This is my second time seeing this. Its pretty much a great show. But I felt like they could have done more with the choreography. Get newer acts. It just reminded me of a cruise ship show. 
Would I go again. Yes because I love the music. With so much talent out there on tv I would think they could make it more exciting."
Beatles Love,"If youre a Beatles fan, then youll enjoy this show. Im not sure if it would be as enjoyable to someone unfamiliar with their music. I am a fan of the Beatles but Im not completely wow-ed by this Cirque show. 

We had gold circle, row K seats, which are supposedly the best according to the box office. I will have to disagree with that sentiment. I would recommend a row or two behind K, as you sit higher up and wont have people walking directly in front of you. 

The show is music like other Cirque shows that Ive witnessed (Mystere, Elvis, and Michael Jackson ONE) in that theres dancing, humor, acrobatics, etc. The lighting, sound and stage setup is very impressive. All this requires a large amount of technology and coordination, which also equals plenty of room for problems as we experienced. Our show was delayed mid-performance for about 5 minutes due to a technical problem. This was the first time Id had this happen to me or even heard of it, although its understandable with all the performers, hydraulic stage and lights. This delay definitely kills the vibe of the show as it essentially causes the performers to break character and simply walk off the stage.

If youve never been to a Cirque show, this is a great way to start but its not the best one.

I rank what Ive seen:
4. Elvis (no longer showing)
3. Mystere
2. LOVE
1. Michael Jackson ONE (definitely the best)"
Beatles Love,"Love has got to be my favorite cirque show. Ive seen it 2x and loved it both times! Theres so much action going on the whole entire time to keep you entertained. 

There is theoretically not a bad seat in the house, since the stage is round with seats surrounding it so youre able to see the stage regardless of where youre sitting. However, Id recommend sitting a bit higher up to be able to take in all thats happening. 

The acrobatics, special effects and costumes were amazing, its a show not to be missed if youre looking to see cirque in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"This is not your typical Cirque show. This is a song and dance show with a very light amount of Cirque like performances thrown in. Underwhelming at best, mind boggingly overpriced at worst. Save your money and spend 200+ bucks on something else. Absolutely not worth the price of admission."
Beatles Love,"ONE HELL OF A SHOW

If I live 1,000 years I doubt I will ever see a show quite like this.  There are so many mind-blowing stunts and nuances that you will be on the edge of your seat the entire time (keep a close and curios eye on that Volkawagen Bug).  Love even excels among other amazing Vegas shows.

This show made me so happy to live in a world that was privileged enough to be privy to the music of The Beatles.  In fact, immediately after the show I felt compelled to fly to Liverpool, scale Paul McCartneys perimeter wall and brave a swarm of guard dogs to tell Paul how happy I was;  I wanted to contact a medium so I could pass the word along to George of how happy I was; I wanted to take a trip to Uganda, board a boat in the town of Kampala, sail down to Bugala Island, meet with a witch doctor that could summon the dead and ask him to conjure up the soul of John Lennon so I could tell him how happy I was; &amp; I wanted to maybe send a letter in the mail to Ringo to tell him how happy I was (Id send him an email but I dont have his address)."
Beatles Love,"One of the best in my book. Living here in Vegas I got to see all mgm cirques. My list for top would be ka, love and mj one. Each one is different in its way but all very good. Each has a storyline but you have to BE ON TIME TO UNDERSTAND it. I see a lot of negative reviews from those who dont understand due to their tardiness. But as for the show its dance and acrobatic with historical add ons"
Beatles Love,"I was immensely entertained throughout the entire 90 minute performance by The Beatles crew. From the music to the dancing to the acrobatic acts, everything was excellent. My favorite part of the show was the rollerblading trio, they performed some awesome stunts!

If you arent too familiar with the music of the Beatles, I would recommend you listen to at least 20 of their songs before attending a performance. That way, you will enjoy and appreciate the act even more."
Beatles Love,Amazing show ! Definitely a MUST SEE if you are a Beatles fan and even if youre not you may just become one after seeing the art and meaning behind all the music. Talented performers I could watch this many times and always be satisfied.
Beatles Love,This is one of the best shows in Vegas. Im not a Beatles fan and that kept me from going for awhile but my husband has never been to a cirque show and I wanted us to go to one that neither of us had gone to. So we picked Beatles love and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. The music was fabulous and the acrobats were fenomenal. Everyone must see at least once
Beatles Love,Fantastic show!! Im not even a huge Beatles fan and I loved every second of it!!! Go see this if youre in Vegas and want to see an Cirque de Soleil show. Ive seen only this and KA and I enjoyed this one so much more. Beautifully done.
Beatles Love,"Easily one of the best shows running in Las Vegas right now. It was full of color and action, catchy music we all knew the words to and it never got boring. In fact, it was sensory overload most of the time. There really is no such thing as a bad seat for this show, although I would suggest skipping anything to low or close to the stage as it might limit your view with so much going on all at once. Here Comes The Sun, Something and Octopus Garden were some of the best acts and I was glad to see that that those songs made it into the show.

We really enjoyed this show, and have even talked about the possibility of seeing it again on a future visit."
Beatles Love,"As a local Ive seen this lovely show 3 times including the test version in the beginning.  Today I was so excited to surprise my 7 y.o. Granddaughter that is in her drama after school program with the experience of watching FREE REHERSALS of LOVE cast. I didnt tell her where or what we were doing...but when we arrived to the Box Office..I told her what we were going to do and see. She was SO EXCITED.  Then the man gave us the bad news. CANCELED...BOO HOO.  Canceled?  The look on her face......broke my heart.
So Grandma and sad kid walked away from what was going to be a BIG MEMORY.   Yes we will someday go back, but the opportunity to watch them rehearse-Priceless. Yes, they have other times maybe in the next couple weeks, but with work and school this was our day. 
I advise anyone coming to Las Vegas, this is a great show to consider."
Beatles Love,"I LOVED IT! LOVE LOVE LOVE! 

This was my first Cirque Du Soleil concert and I was very surprised with the turnout. I grew up listening to The Beatles because my father loved them when he was growing up as well. I chose this concert to go to because I knew I would be familiar with the music. I didnt expect much at first, but from the beginning to the end of the performance I was completely blown away. The acrobatics were terrifyingly amazing, and the music choice was at its finest because they were hit songs that I knew. The projection of the music was also very clear and I dont think there were any bad seating: in the crowd even when I was sitting on the rear end of the balcony.

My experience with The Beatles LOVE show was definitely one to remember and relive again when I get a chance. It may not have been the actual Beatles performing, but it sure felt like they were there. The theater ambiance and performances were perfect enough to continue impressing the crowd throughout the show.

If you or your parents or grandparents or your friends love The Beatles, then you will love this show. I definitely recommend you to see it, especially during the summer because you can get great deals!"
Beatles Love,"There are well over a thousand reviews on Love, so Ill be very brief here. I was suckered in by the flashing lights, happy faces and great reviews. We went to Vegas twice in 6 months, once in November and again last month, in March. In November, we saw Boys II Men, also at the Mirage and pasted by LOVE. It looked amazing and I wished we could have seen it then, but due to time constraints, we simply couldnt. I also like the Beatles, so this seemed like an instant love connection. I was so wrong. 

On with the positives... The production spares no expense on set, decor, costume or lights. This is one of the more elaborate shows. There is always something happening on set and your attention will be pulled in a thousand directions. This circque de sole show pulls out all the bells and whistles. 

The not so good... Of all the amazing songs that the Beatles created, they choose a wide variety of popular and no so popular to convey their messages.  For example, there was one scene during the show that references the civil rights era in America and had actors dressed in Ku Klux Klan costumes... That was a little unexpected, but it somehow ties into the story line. How it ties in exactly, I dont really know. There is a lot going on (and not in a good way). There were a few acts that just had me completely confused."
Beatles Love,"Definitely a great show
I saw it 3 times 
If you are or arent a Beatles fan you will enjoy it. 
The acrobats are incredible 
The music and lights are beautiful 

Definitely recommend to all. 
There is an amazing gift shop open all day long and there is a Beatles Lounge"
Beatles Love,"WOW! The show opened with a bang, my eyes where looking at everything and everyone, my heart was filled with so much joy. This show was amazing, wish there was more acrobatics involved but nonetheless it was spectacular!"
Beatles Love,"To quote Brad Sherwood from Whose Line Is It Anyway I Love Love, and I Love to Love Love. I absolutely was dumbstruck by this show. I feel that there is no other experience like it. The Set design, costumes and choreography are top notch.

Its so good that I cant even identify which part I loved the most. The banter between the band was spot on. This show is definitely worth the price of admission! The staff were courteous and really helpful. I cant recommend the show enough if you make your way to Las Vegas. Also, like Michael Jacksons ONE, buy your tickets at the Box Office, not online. Youll get a better deal."
Beatles Love,"This is our fourth visit to Love and was looking forward to the new revamped version.
Very disappointed from the original show and theme. While most of the music is the same the show seemed dark and sometimes lifeless. Also not a big fan of shows with a political agenda mixed in as the Song Blackbird turned into. Keep entertainment and politics separated it will be a better result. 
If youve never seen Love I recommend it but for me I am done with it."
Beatles Love,"This show was off the Hook my mind was blown 5 minutes into the show. The Performers, choreography, music. Show was so much to take in. Beautiful!"
Beatles Love,"This is my fifth show and it was sat the Mirage 
. They have two shows 7 and 9.  I went to the early show. Wasnt very packed.  Wow to watch the performers THEY WERE Amazing!!!! It was great to also know the words during the show.  Its a must if you have been thinking about it. You will enjoy it as much as I did."
Beatles Love,"Honestly I LOVE the Beatles, I didnt love this. For approximately 
$130 per person I watched some fairly cool acrobatic acts but overall not impressed. I wouldve enjoyed my recliner better with a good Beatles CD playing watching tv. Save your money."
Beatles Love,"Have you ever done acid?  Me neither, and I was never planning on doing so.  But I imagine if I ever did, it would feel like this show. Ill admit, Im no Beatles fan but weve seen nearly all the Cirque Vegas shows and we convinced by a tour guide at O that we must see this one even if we arent Beatles fans. 

The GOOD:
Im so torn because this show was fun because it was so interactive.  Very cool ways for the whole audience to participate a few times which was a very pleasant plus.  The music was cool, drinks were jumbo-sized.  Was lucky to sit not too far from the bathroom which is suggested if youre drinking a jumbo-sized margarita during the performance. The theater was large with most seats in the house giving good views.  We sat in a very front row which gave us extra leg room and a couple performers came right up to us. Way cool except this one dancer who was dancing directly in front of me, and I kept looking at her feet in my face thinking she really needed a pedicure if shes going to be performing in bare feet.  Ultimately, I think itd be a little easier on the eyes &amp; neck to sit at least 3-4 rows back. Ultimately nearly all seats should give nice views.  


The BAD:
On the other hand, it was very trippy and make me feel kinda high but not in a good way.  Like in a there is WAY too much going on and Im getting a headache and nauseous.  Some of the performers were great, but not nearly as many as in other Cirques shows like O (my fave), Michael Jackson ONE (also my fave), Ka, and Mystere.  It was a lot of dancing and not as much thrilling acrobatic action Ive seen in other shows. Its there, but not as much.

BOTTOM-LINE:  Im glad I saw it but its not my favorite Cirque show by far.  If you can only see one or two while in Vegas, you must choose Michael Jackson ONE and/or O at the Bellagio.  KEEP READING IF YOU DONT MIND SPOILERS...

The TRIPPY:  (***SPOILER ALERT***)

The show opens with WAY TOO MUCH GOING ON.  Like a ton of people on stage dancing, not the best dancing either.  If you want to see great acrobatic dancing, its not here, its at Michael Jackson ONE cirque show.  There are kids in pajamas, a (faux) pregnant dancer, a bald guy who looks like Dr Evil and is pouring everyone invisible tea from his tea pot, sensory overload and not in a good way.  Later theres a scene with some dancers in KKK white hooded mask outfits, then it cuts to the song black bird, then you have this actor making sounds like Eddie Murphy when he did In the hot tub SNL skit and doing step moves like from a fraternity.  Weird indeed.  Be prepared to protect your drink in the end before confetti falls in it."
Beatles Love,"Love! Love! Love!..... Theyve made a few changes since last year, but its still amazing!!! Great music and performers!  My all time favorite show. So much to look at. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
Beatles Love,"Love is like a mashup of your favorite Beatles songs ... that you watch whilst on an incredibly pleasant acid trip. Theres no better way for me to describe it.  

Dont go into this show expecting a traditional musical with beginning, middle and end---youre not going to get that. Theres no storyline. 

Love is really all about taking the audience on a unique multi-sensory experience. It is a series of unique, artistic (mind-blowing!) interpretations of Beatles songs. Its more like the best concert youve ever been to, and less like what you might recognize as traditional theater. 

Its about feelings and experiences, not about a storyline.

At the risk of throwing around a cliche, it was truly a feast for the eyes. It was packed full of every kind of entertainment: beloved Beatles tunes, dance, trapeze artists, clowns, contortionists, gymnasts, roller skaters, and more--each more impressive than the one before.

The use (and creative manipulation!) of stage space, lighting, costumes and props really blew our minds. Its clear that sooooo much creativity went into the making of this show. The way that the show transformed the environment and welcomed the audience to participate in the production was really unique. There was one part where the stage and audience was almost entirely enveloped in a huge parachute, onto which a lazer show was projected. It was incredible and just one small example of how mind-altering the show is. 

Love was filled with so many impressive, awe-inspiring, and truly amazing moments. (I cant tell you how many times I accidentally said Oh my god audibly out loud during the show.) I was hesitant to see this show because Id heard so many folks say that the Beatles Love is  only so-so in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows ... but Im glad I did! Me and my husband (in our 30s) saw it with my parents (both in their 60s) and we all absolutely LOVED every moment of it. It was such a unique and special experience, and worth every penny of the $119/each that we paid for our tickets."
Beatles Love,"Amazing!!! Ive always loved cirque du soleil, but holy cow I was blown away! It was so good! 10/10 recommend this show!"
Beatles Love,"This was one of the best shows Ive seen so far. I did watch four Cirque du Soleil shows prior this one, just not in Vegas. I do understand it doesnt have as many acrobatic tricks as some other shows, but its so creative and colorful. If you like Beatles music there is no way you wont like this show. I couldnt believe how well they used the music and story line for their performances. Amazing! 
Theater is small and rounded and everybody is right - there are no bad seats in this theater. I thought couple first rows are too low though, it looks like they are literally built in the stage. But some people may like it, you would feel part of the performance. We sat in section 204 and it was great! I could still see artists faces but also were able to take full picture in."
Beatles Love,"Awesome show, continuous entertainment, must see in Vegas if you are a Beatles fan or not!  I would definitely see again!"
Beatles Love,"Im glad I watched this. Love is very good. It is what you get when you combine the well known theatrical acrobatic of Cirque Du Soleil with pop culture that is Beatles music. The result? Mesmerizing performance that you see while tapping you feet in rhythm. It is entertaining. Especially with speakers in your own seat, making you feel engulfed in music. So this is how Beatles music sounds like with 21st century speakers, and gosh I want that seat in my house!

I like the stage settings in the middle of the podium and screens all around. Because of this, there are no real bad seats in this show. I was at the front row of balcony seats, which is in the cheapest tickets category and I still feel as part of the performance. In fact, I think I could see the lighting affects better from up there. 

Some comments though, I feel that Love doesnt have as impressive acrobatic stunts as Ka and Mystere, and some scenes have so much things going on, its hard to grab the storyline. Despite of this, I enjoyed the whole show. The lighting effects are superb! I feel this is a must-see Cirque Du Soleil, even if you are not The Beatles die-hard fan. I rank it above Mystere and slightly below Ka, which is the best Cirque Du Soleil for me.

4.5 stars."
Beatles Love,This is my 4th Cirque and this has been the best one yet. The environment is pure magic and the theatrics and music are just perfect. Loved everything about the show.
Beatles Love,"This was an amazing show even though Im not the biggest Beatles fan. Ive only seen one Cirque du Soleil show before and it was Paramour in NYC and it doesnt compare whatsoever!
The 360 stage is so cool and everything happens all around you all at once. The interpretations of the songs were really cool and it was nice to see the back story of the Beatles.

I definitely recommend this show to anyone especially if you do appreciate Beatles music."
Beatles Love,"Im sure this was exciting for many people. I, however, could not wait for the torture to end. Too loud, uncomfortable chairs and sucky if youre not a Beatles fan. Maybe the regular cirque show would have been a more worthwhile experience.

Had to exit to ask an attendant for ear plugs so that I could rejoin my party and not appear rude."
Beatles Love,"All You Need Is LOVE!

The Beatles LOVE was my first Cirque dus Soleil show so I didnt know exactly what to expect. I appreciate theater &amp; the performing arts, but Im the kind of person more inclined to go to a pro sporting event, stand-up comedy routine or a concert. I have always wanted to watch a Cirque show though &amp; in Vegas, its Cirque du-palooza!  

That being said, I thoroughly loved The Beatles LOVE Cirque show. In 1.5 hours, the audience was completely captivated by the cast &amp; crews interpretation of all the Beatles greatest hits (including my fave, Eleanor Rigby) through their ornate costumes, stunning stage props, dynamite dancing/choreography, and jaw-dropping acrobats &amp; stunts.

FYI: The Beatles LOVE Cirque show is located in the Mirage Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, NV. I sat in Section 204 as advised by the Mirage ticket agent as being the best seats in the house to view this show. I agree you can see everything perfectly without having to strain your neck like youd have to if you were any closer. There is no intermission, but the show flies by &amp; I think its the perfect length at 1.5 hrs, any longer would be overkill! There are concessions &amp; beer available for purchase before the show, doors open 30 min prior to show time. No pictures or video are allowed during the show...but ya know, see my pics!

There are a lot of Cirque shows to choose from in Vegas, so let me yelp you out if youre unsure whether The Beatles LOVE show is gonna be up your alley. I loved this show because it has a gemazing team of performers that does a fantastic rendition of The Fab Four without being overly dancy, froofy, boring or too long! Even if you only like the Beatles, you can bet your bottom dollar yer gonna LOVE Cirque du Soleil-The Beatles LOVE... a lovely, rockin 5-gem show!!"
Beatles Love,"Hey Jude, dont make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Beatles music + Cirque du Soleil = The Beatles Love

This is in a circular stage so there are really no bad seats, but if you are willing to pay a bit more, seats in the lower level close to the main stage will give you the best view of most of the actions.  If you can, get an aisle seat to get some up-close-and-personal views of some bonus actions and of course, be right next to some of the absolutely gorgeous and lovely performers.

The presentation is excellent and the storyline somewhat loosely corresponds to some major World events that took place in the Beatles era.  The show really doesnt highlight the Beatles legacy, but rather, how the World changed during their legacy.

The mood and pace swing often throughout the show - from upbeat and acrobatic to soft, mellow and romantic. From bright and cheerful to dark and sorrowful.

There are some truly beautiful scenes expressed not just in absolute beauty, but also combined with sheer strength and athleticism. (For example, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, among many other interludes).

There are also scenes that are fast-paced and acrobatic, but in a creative and refreshing way. (For example, Revolution).

However, to be fair, this show really lacks the jaw-dropping, thrilling and gravity-defying high-flying actions that are typical of a top tier Vegas show - Cirque-branded or not.

Nevertheless, this show is so much fun to watch and is so emotional, memorable and entertaining that, even though it doesnt have many bodies diving and flying in the air sans wire, and it doesnt make me bite my fingernails and pray for the performers safety,  I still have to give it 5 stars.

And the best part is that you really dont need to be a Beatles fan to love the show.  But if you are, then youll definitely fall in love with the show.  Youll fall completely in love.  Madly in love.  Hopelessly in love.

Endlessly in love."
Beatles Love,The perfect combo of rocking music and fantastic theater! 100% would recommend this. Food and drink was really pricey but Ive come to expect that in Vegas. It was an amazing show and I think anyone how can go should go.
Beatles Love,"Really good show! Hubby and I enjoyed every minute. Sometimes, I dont know where to look! So much happening. Very entertaining. 

Tip: Ask if you can get better seats. They usually move you closer to the stage if the show isnt full. We good free tickets with nosebleed seats and the usher moved us to front row after we joked about it. It was really nice! Got a rose too from the performers. Fun show!"
Beatles Love,"This was my third time to see LOVE. Three years ago, prior to moving to Vegas, I spent a girls weekend with my cousins and sister. On the last night in Vegas, one of the cousins wanted to see LOVE. I was kinda bummed because, Im not a Beatles fan, but I wasnt going to fuss about it and thought I should just follow the crowd and do something different and I am so glad I did.

Theres this air of excitement while waiting to go in the theatre. Theres Beatles music playing, while Beatles fans are singing along. Its infectious.

When you walk into the theatre, you just know its going to be awesome! Its a small venue AND the theatre is round, so that means every seat is a good seat.

WARNING! Just because you pay for the most expensive seats near the stage doesnt necessarily mean those are the best seats. Because of LOVE, Ive learned to sit higher up so that I wouldnt strain my neck looking up to see all the aerial stunts and imagery.

Im not going to give any details of the show away and ruin your experience. However, seeing this show a third time with someone new to the show, I enjoy hearing WOW! THATS SO COOL! THAT WAS AMAZING!  I LOVE LOVE!"
Beatles Love,"One of the most beautiful shows I have ever seen in my whole life.  The music was like a warm hug and the sound system divine.  Each seat had stereo speakers.  We sat at the top center and what an awe inspiring experience.  The concept and the execution is genius.  The colors, the artistry... BRAVO.    There was too much to look at simultaneously - hows that for a complaint?!? I was overwhelmed and will rant about this show for years.  GO!"
Beatles Love,"Definitely one of the best Cirque shows I have seen. I love the Beatles so the theme was expected to be awesome but they also put it together well. There were a few surprises and effects that I had not seen in a Cirque show before, so that was nice. I would like to see it again."
Beatles Love,"Im a fan of The Beatles and this was my first Cirque show. I had a really fun time and enjoyed all the music. There are no bad seats in the theater and the mixed drinks from the concession stand were tasty, ~$50 for two 24oz drinks w/collector cup. Visit the gift store during the day to avoid the rush."
Beatles Love,"LOVE is a great show and probably the highlight of our trip to Vegas. If you are a Beatles or Cirque fan, I dont think you will be disappointed with the performance. True, there may be less acrobatics than other Cirque shows, but it is still a highly entertaining, captivating and artistic show.  The theatre is small, and dont be afraid to sit in the second tier, our seats were great. 

I loved the Lucy in the sky with diamonds act, and also Here comes the sun. Both were visually stunning, beautifully executed, and exciting to watch."
Beatles Love,"My friend was nice enough to purchase tickets for this show. We got bumped closer to fill in the seats which was nice. I dont think there is a bad seat in the house! I do recommend sitting in the middle instead of up close. There is soo much to see, you will get dizzy at trying to look at everything. The music of course was fantastic and sounded great in the stadium! Between the music and the beautiful dancing, Ill admit I got caught up in the moment and teared up a bit. It was so exciting from beginning to end and thoroughly enjoyed it! It was the highlight of my trip! It was a bummer that we couldnt take pictures because I would have loved to save those memories."
Beatles Love,"I thought the show was disjointed, lacked a unifying theme, and did a great disservice to the Beatles genius and ground breaking courage in deeply challenging times. Sure, if hearing Really Loud snippets of old Beatles faves is what youre looking for, by all means go (because the snippets are accompanied by dancers in bright costumes who perform occasional great acrobatic moves and drive real cars onstage.) But as a child of the 60s who grew up in SF, this show gave nothing. It felt formulaic and tired. 
 
I was hoping the show would have at least one profound moment about the Beatles legacy I could share with my family but, for me, there were none.  

Suggestion #1 - buy the cheapest seats (I wish we had.) 
Suggestion #2- just listen to their music."
Beatles Love,"A feast for the eyes and soul. 60s trippy complete with VW bugs and mod fashion sense, the show did not disappoint. Ive been trying to acquire tickets for LOVE now for a few years whenever I get to Las Vegas. Finally I succeeded. It has all the wild acrobatics of the typical Cirque du Soleil show with the addition of the Beatles soundtrack remixed by Beatles producer Sir George Martin and his son Giles. One of the coolest things about the soundtrack was hearing lots of lost behind the scenes audio clips of the mop top lads from Liverpool horsing around in the studio between takes -some of which Ive heard and some a brand new experience for me. 

A colorful kaleidoscope of sound and visuals. Definitely five stars for me! A splendid time is guaranteed for all!"
Beatles Love,What a production! Tremendously impressive! Truly an eye orgasm. Ive seen KA and MJ 1 this week and this is truly the most amazing. Granted they have an unfair advantage with their music but the characters are so dynamic.  Bucket list for sure!
Beatles Love,"Aesthetically gorgeous show  with a  large cast performing in a unique wheel-shaped stage, set to Beatles music- you dont need to be a superfan to appreciate and enjoy an amazing night here, nor do you have to shell out for any particular seating section as they all offer amazing views. In fact, Id sit further back to be able to take in more than just whats right in front of your seat.

Lucked into some amazing second-row seats via a generous Yelper (thanks Janel!) and spent the evening swiveling my head back and forth and up and everywhere trying to take in all of the action. At times there are up to 30 performers on stage or in the air with no central focus point, as such it seems like it would translate to one of the few shows worth seeing more than once, as you could easily see things you missed before.

Favorite parts:
Strawberry Fields Forever with bubbles
Here Comes The Sun with candles
Octopuss Garden with lights
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds almost a literal interpretation

Consistently rated one of the best shows in Vegas, recommended as one of the best Cirque shows, LOVE lives up to the hype-  and then some!

TIP: Dont get a drink in the lobby, you dont want your bladder to force you to miss any of the scenes!"
Beatles Love,"Loved LOVE  an absolute treat! Went with a group and had a great time! Think I sang every song. Reminded me of my brother who grew up during the BEATLES. At some points in the show I thought I was on a trip! Lots of excitement on stage, quick and make sure you look at everything. The show did not disappoint. Really left feeling happy and loved! Glad I helped celebrate their 5,000 show! Go see it! Wish the balls were thrown around more like blue men group!"
Beatles Love,"This show is great, especially if you love to watch elaborate dance scenes. But if youre looking for tons of acrobatics, this is not the right Cirque show for you. Costumes and sets are gorgeous and elaborate. They really immerse you in the entire experience!

I highly recommend sitting in the middle to back of the audience - sit any closer and you cant get a good feel of all of the things happening onstage!"
Beatles Love,"July 2018. This show is great. Highly recommend seeing. We sat 3rd row from the stage. Awesome acrobatics, singing, the musical brought you back to yester years. Very colorful and no intermission throughout the show. They kept performing number after number. Such energy!  Fantastic...well worth seeing and getting souvenirs after."
Beatles Love,One of the best shows we have seen. I am a huge Beatles fan and was not disappointed. My wife likes The Beatles (not a huge fan like me) and loved it. A not miss show when in Las Vegas
Beatles Love,The show is good. Family friendly.  Dont sit too close.  Amazing production really.  Just impressive to see the show all run. Im not sure youd see it twice however.
Beatles Love,"I may have been born in the late 80s but having a parent listen to, sing, and play The Beatles throughout my early childhood, I became accustomed to their music thus becoming a fan myself.  So going to Vegas and watching The Beatles LOVE was a given for me.  

Watching this show was amazing! I loved how they became so creative with the songs and incorporated the audience in parts of the show.  I have to admit, I did cry on occasions because the songs matched the storyline to the tee.  

Overall, this show was great, the dancers were awesome, the acrobatics were flawless, and the music took you into another dimension.  The only issue however, is that if you do have vertigo, I suggest you sit in the back area so you wont get sick from all the lights and movements.  Other than that, order a ticket, sit back, relax and enjoy this show!"
Beatles Love,"I must say, one of the best shows I have ever seen. I have seen the one on video which is Worlds Away, but it does Not even compare to an actual live show. We decided last second to try and get tickets at one of the half price tickets place on the strip, but was sold out not even a half hour after they opened. Very bummed I had my wife check online and found two for a little more than what we would have gotten in the first place, but the early show was gone.

It did not seem like it was working out very well, but when we got in the show it all turned around. The delayed show, long lines, etc did not matter because we had somehow gotten front row seats and we could lean and touch the stage. The show was absolutely amazing coming from a couple that see Broadway shows and musicals often. The music was fantastic, the performers were awesome, and the experience was memorable. In fact the show was so interactive with the audience and my wife even got a rose from Sargent Peppers himself. Great show and a must see!!!! Be warned though, it is a sensory overload with lights, sound, etc."
Beatles Love,"So I decided to surprise my GF with love tickets since she loves The Beatles and cirque du solei. I got a great deal on tickets and great seats. The waiting area is a bit small and can get a bit claustrophobic. The Beatles shop is overpriced but then again they got a few things I havent seen anywhere else. Once inside the little walkway is awesome for pictures (when its not crowded). 

Like the movies the concession are overpriced but hey its Vegas and its expected. The actual venue is small so any seat will be good. The show itself is awesome (it was my first cirque show) with the small stage they had they did a lot of tricks. I am actually thinking of doing the other cirque shows next time Im in town"
Beatles Love,"Its starting to become a mission of mine to check out all the different Cirque Du Soleil shows now.

I got introduced to these shows not too long ago and ever since I watch my first ever show maybe 2 years ago, Im hooked! Ive been wanting to see The Beatles show for some time now so we decided to score some tickets on our last Vegas trip.

Upon walking into the theatre, I seriously loved the psychedelic runway into the entrance!! It was all very 70s! We got the lowest priced tickets were in the seating area c or d. They were only $70 so we didnt really care where we ended up seating. However, when we arrived inside, they moved us closer to the stage because they were some empty seats in the theatre! Score!

One thing I absolutely loved about the The Beatles show was the way the theatre is set up. The stage is right in the center and the seats are surrounded around the stage al wherever youre sitting youre going to get a good view. Even if you the balcony seats youre going to be able to see the stage pretty well. I actually recommend getting the seats a little bit further up bc sometimes the acrobat will be up in the air and you wont be able to see them sitting so close to the stage. 

The show itself was pretty good. They focus more on the songs and the themes of each song than they do for stunts and tricks. I admit the other Cirque shows had way more impressive stunts but I really enjoyed watching them perform to some of the old Beatles classics.

If youre a Beatles fan youre going go absolutely love this show. It does a good job on representing each song and doing justice by adding some creative and impressive choreography to each song."
Beatles Love,"I had never seen a Cirque show until I saw The Beatles LOVE - but I am a huge Beatles fan and had wanted to see a Cirque show for quite some time. Ive had the soundtrack since the show debuted, and just finally was able to go to the show this past weekend.

The show was amazing and I want to take my entire family. Im sure plenty of people before me have reviewed the content and the technical aspects, so let me throw around some tips about the actual experience of seeing this show in particular and what stood out to me.

1) There really is no bad seat (unless you get one of the cheap-o seats that SAY restricted viewing when you book.) The theater is smaller than I had anticipated, and although I was in the highest section, still had a fantastic view.

2) The lobby is really fun and unique and there are a lot of cool drinks to buy (just be prepared to spend around $20 on a large drink in a souvenir cup). Having said that - there is NO BATHROOM in the lobby. So if youre like me, and you decide to guzzle down your entire large drink in the show, and then race out when its over because you need to pee, be prepared to navigate all the way out the lobby, past the gift shop, and around the corner from the box office!

3) Its not what I had in my head of a typical Cirque show (although I havent seen any others.) The acrobatics were fun but mostly not jaw-dropping. There was a lot of dancing and some fun running around. Dont expect to be mesmerized by crazy body-bending and mind blowing feats. Thats not what this is about; its about the music and telling the stories of the Beatles history and music. Thats not a negative thing - its just a note about the content and style of the show.

4) Try to get into the lobby a bit early so you can take pictures with all the fun decor before it gets too crowded. Grab your drink and take a selfie - you sure wont be able to after the performance when its packed!"
Beatles Love,"This was truly an amazing show for the whole family. My girls 8 and 18 both loved it.  We sat in front row but all seats seemed to have a nice view. 10 star show!!! FYI...go to gift shop first, afterwords  its packed."
Beatles Love,"This is as good as it gets! I LOVE this show!
Riveting and imaginative storyline, amazing acoustics, not a bad seat in the house. Cannot like this enough, Ive been twice now! 
P.S. You can bring in drinks from ANYWHERE, in all shapes and sizes to beat the expensive prices and lines there."
Beatles Love,"All you need is LOVE. 

Love love loved this show!! Growing up listening to the Beatles album in the car with my dad made the experience even better. Its a much awesome experience if you know the songs and story behind the Beatles. 

Im so glad we chose to watch this Cirque du Soleil show. There are actors/actresses during the pre show which keeps the audience entertained. As for location of where youre sitting, it really doesnt matter as the theatre is round and youre able to see everything no matter where you sit. Theres just so much going on you sometimes dont know where to look which is why I would give this show a 4.5 stars. 

Its a pretty impressive show and if youre in Vegas, I recommend watching a cirque du Soleil show. This one is located at the Mirage which is just along the strip. 

Surprisingly, they allowed photography, just as long as it did not have flash which was mentioned by the announcer at the beginning of the show. The theatre gets crowded just after the show as everybody wants to take photos so if you want to take photos, I suggest doing so before the show!!"
Beatles Love,"What a show!! My mom was wanting to see this show and so we came on Friday 5/22 to the 930pm show. It was fantastic! I had heard great things about it but didnt expect it to be this good. The colors, production, acting, and acrobatics went perfectly to the music of the Beatles. I would highly recommend this show to everyone!"
Beatles Love,This has been my favorite Vegas show!! Its beautiful as a family night or date night. You really cant go wrong with any seat in the house. We did sit in the 3rd row and got to participates in the show. But with entertainment dropping from all angles you should constantly be entertained.
Beatles Love,"After watching KA during my last Vegas trip... I was weary of watching another Cirque show here... but fortunately... this turned out to be frickin awesome!

From the costumes... the live music... the acts... the lights... wow. Definitely well worth every penny and really... if youre a fan of the Beatles... you cant miss this!"
Beatles Love,"Interesting show.... very fun and colorful! However, I wish I had been better versed on the Beatles history prior to viewing the show. The music was VERY LOUD, so bring earplugs if you have sensitive hearing, or want to keep your hearing."
Beatles Love,"If you were never a big Beatles fan before, after this show youll be wanting to listen to them more and MORE!!!!!!! I know I did!

I have been to this show four times now since 2008, and each time Ive been it has been just absolutely magical.  The idea of mashing up Beatles songs to some, may seem sacrilegious, but I for one found it to be absolutely GENIUS!

Ive seen other peoples review of this show how the story is difficult to follow... it isnt.  It really isnt difficult.  If you know anything about the Beatles in the most simple explanations of their music and the time in which they were huge, then the show will make perfect sense to you.

Certain show pieces are directly correlated to the music thats playing, while others are just background pieces, but altogether, the show is one amazing sight to see!

Also, many have complained that none of their favorite songs are used.  That is just a very minor detail.  Remember folks, this is a Cirque du Soleil SHOW, not a Beatles concert of their Greatest Hits.  If you want to hear your favorite Beatles song, just go to Spotify/Pandora and find it and quit complaining.

I love the performers that come out beforehand in the audience and interact with the teapot.  Theyre obviously enjoying their job and they really make a wonderful effort to interact with as many people as they can before the lights go out.

Ive been fortunate enough to have in the four times Ive gone to have seen the show from different perspectives.  One time, my fiancée and I got a $99 Locals Special for a designated seating area but it was actually closed off, so for FREE, we were allowed to go sit down in the lower two front rows by the stage!  It was a blast to be able to see everyone so close and also get to be underneath the giant sheet used in the show!

Then another time, for our anniversary we had seats in an upper seating zone that was somewhat uncomfortable and since the show wasnt a sold out performance we were asked by a cast member if wed like to move to our own individual swivel chairs in another area which we were very happy about!  Plus we had that entire area all to ourselves! Nobody else was sitting below us or next to us!

The Beatles Love by Cirque du Soleil was the ONLY Cirque show I had seen until 2015 when my fiancée and I saw Le Reve for her birthday, but its definitely a different type of experience.  All I can say is that when it comes to repeat viewings of shows in Las Vegas, I will ALWAYS pick The Beatles Love!

From what Ive read recently, they have given the show a bit of an update and made it more psychedelic and some have said its not a good upgrade.  Well, I feel like I may just have to make trip number five to judge for myself!

Best parts of the show for me (Small spoilers ahead!)

-The opening performance for Get Back/Glass Onion when those curtains drop after Ringos drum solo from The End that really gets you in the mood for something big about to happen!

-The dancing galoshes in the Lady Madonna sequence

-The Abbey Road VW Beetle both intact, then in pieces during the A Day in the Life sequence

-The Help! rollerbladers

-The jumpers with trampolines during the Revolution sequence

-The Beatles Shadows bits that show on the curtains between sequences

-The finale

Really, all you need IS love!"
Beatles Love,Doesnt get any better. My second time seeing this show and I would go again! Also if you saw this a while ago they have changed so much! Go see it again. The single best production show Ive ever seen. You dont have to love the Beatles to enjoy this show.
Beatles Love,"wow.  double wow.  seen this show twice,. both times it blew my mind.  The theatre is great.  good seats.  amazing special effects.  costumes !!!!
I highly recommend this one !!!"
Beatles Love,"From the moment I approached the theatre entrance up until the conclusion/end, I enjoyed every minute of the experience of this show.

Firstly, all of the ushers/workers/staff are dressed in what I would call traditional clothing from the music period of the Beatles heyday in England.  An English touch is also present with a large scale replica of the Union Jack on the ceiling as well.  On your way to the theatre, guests will pass the LOVE store as well as a color changing wall with a composition/pattern depicting the fab four.

The theatre itself is a spectacle as well as a technical accomplishment that befits the typical Cirque show in Vegas.  Its 360 degree stage allows the audience to view the show from different perspectives depending on their seats.  

As far as the the show itself, its definitely an achievement and triumph in showcasing the music and period of the Beatles with all of the acts, costumes, and enjoyment that Cirque Du Soleil is renowned for.  The costumes are colorful and dramatic, the cast is full of happiness and energy, and the music may just tempt you start clapping along or dance in your seat perhaps =)  

Although all of the acts/performers in LOVE are up to the standards Cirque shows are known for, one of my favorite parts of the show involves some audience participation.  I wont give anything away except to say that if youre seated in the front rows/section, your participation will be needed at some point.  It was quite fun to say the least and was one of the more surprising and fun aspects of the show!!

Bottom Line:  I would definitely recommend this show to people who are either fans of the Beatles or Cirque Du Soleil, or who are fans of both.  Enjoy!"
Beatles Love,"Awesome show. A must when in Vegas. Great music and acrobats synced to beatles songs. The seats has speaker for surround sound effect. No photo taking.
Worth the line and the $$."
Beatles Love,"Our team attended this spectacular sensory experience of amazing artists, dancers and theatrics, music, props, lighting. Staging and unique costumes. Just WOW!! A true feast for the senses!"
Beatles Love,"I have to start this review off with the preface.. if you didnt absolutely adore every second of LOVE.. you need to put your inner child on a the back of a milk carton.. because its lost.. and for that, I am truly sad for you. 

(The comments you see in negative reviews talking about needing to be on acid or have lost your mind to enjoy this show are just about the most inane things I have read on Yelp.)

My girlfriend and I booked our flights as we did just to make sure we would be in Vegas in time to pick up our tickets the day of.. and I was prepared to risk jail time to call the box office from the airplane if we were going to be late for some reason.

To start, the theatre is beautiful situated in the Mirage. We spent a lot of time in and around the gift shop and in the bar close to it. There is plenty of LOVE related swag. We even grabbed a few small things. There is a few solid places to snap a photo, and the staff is really good to allow people to do that as the show is going on and in the chaos between shows.

Its a little bit of a cattle herding start, but we just sort of ended up at the front of the bus and got let in first, to be able to get to the concession stand (things are little pricy) but the bartender was good enough to fill up our keeper glasses we had with water for a tip.

Then you wait with great anticipation for the next gate opening, as they usher you into the theatre. Its dark and a little hard to navigate but there are plenty of staff there to assist you.

We were situated in the middle of section B. I got a ticket for free because of MLifes app called MyVegas which saved us over $100 bucks in the end. (And I got this on the last day I would have a chance before we actually left for Vegas)

Section B is where its at.. Sure there is not a bad seat in the house as this theatre was built for the show itself... but you are just high enough that you dont miss anything over your head or behind you.. and you are close enough to really catch all the subtles. 

The girlfriend and I have tried a few times to decide what our favorite scene was.. and it changes by the hour it seems. The Lucy in the Sky scene was just so memorable.. but in the Octopus Garden is right up there too.

There is not really a story persay. A few characters along the way you can follow, Sargent Peppers, and the four boys are a constant. But honestly, if you want a movie, go see one in a theatre... this show is just some of the best music you will ever hear in a show, and pure eye porn for your senses.

I did not see one person coming out unhappy with their experience. 

Its more than worth its price in memories."
Beatles Love,Great show!!  This is our fourth or fifth cirque du soleil show and we love them all!!  You just cant go wrong when seeing one of these shows!!  Of course the music in the Beatles show is awesome!
Beatles Love,"i fell asleep during the show...  and ive never fallen asleep in any cirque shows before.  

well for one, im not a beatles fan, so it was more difficult to get me engaged with the production.  

the acrobatics did not live up to other cirque shows standards.

just glad i had a glass of wine in hand to get me through the show."
Beatles Love,"Perhaps I just enjoy more upbeat Beatles music, but the songs were obscure and the imagery disturbing. It opens with what seems like a joyful circus like atmosphere that gets bombed and walls are broken, bodies strewn around. With recent events, this seems too close for comfort, and lacking compassion or tact. Then there were KKK hoods on guys wearing white gowns. Seriously, they shouldve warned us. Thank goodness I didnt bring my kids to see this show. The producers should consider having more of a story line that is less destructive and more in keeping with the title."
Beatles Love,"This was my second time seeing the Beatles Love show. This first one blew my mind and was very uplifting. I couldnt wait to take my niece and my best friend. However I was incredibly disappointed. The show had more of a Pink Floyd (which I love but is more dark) feel from the creepy masks, to the war scenes and fighting. I certainly didnt feel the love and my 10 year old niece even found it a little scary and covered hear ears a lot. The dancing, the props, the theatre are all still amazing but if your wanting an uplifting show where you feel the love, this isnt it! Change the name and maybe I wouldnt have been disappointed. Almost felt like it had a political agenda..."
Beatles Love,"- The Beatles LOVE, was the first Cirque du Soleil show I have ever attended (back in 2009.) Having attended tons of shows, including more than 10 Cirque du Soleil performances, I have to say that  LOVE is my least favorite one. It was convenient for us, since we were staying at the Mirage. Maybe if I was a fan of the Beatles I would have appreciated it more,Duh!

- There was less acrobatic moves, and more dancing. 
- The longest 90 minutes, and the most wastful 90$ of my Las Vegas trip.
- Still loved the visual effects.
 
Three Yelps."
Beatles Love,"Such an amazing show. I m not a huge Beatles fan but this show is so worth seeing. I couldnt even choose my favorite part, they were all breathtaking, innovative and creative. LOVEd it!!"
Beatles Love,"There is nothing not to like about this show.  I am by no means a Beatles die hard and I loved everything about the show.  The music and acoustics were amazing.  The aerials and stage were mystifying.  I read that they spent over $100 million building the stage and it shows.  Its truly amazing!  I know its slightly different that other Cirque shows, but you will not be disappointed!

Just a note, but we got our tickets on Travelzoo for half off.  $65 a ticket was a lot easier to stomach than the full price."
Beatles Love,"I booked our couples trip to Vegas so my husband could finally see the Blue Man Group (very disappointing experience) but then booked the Beatles LOVE show on a whim for our last night in Vegas. This is truly an incredible show with stunning beauty, creativity and talent. The stage is constantly morphing and flowing and is just surreal in its effect . Highly, highly recommend!"
Beatles Love,This show did not disappointment. Not a bad seat in the house as we had are seats in the last row.  Great dancing and music come together for a non stop show. Its not as technical as other Cirque du Soleil shows but its makes up for it with the dance routines.
Beatles Love,"If you love the Beatles like I do, every song played will take you through such a beautiful emotional roller coaster. I loved this show!!! The music paired with cirque de soleil acts worked so well!!! I  this show!!"
Beatles Love,Great show !! My boss suggested going and you did not disappoint. The stage is in the round so even the cheap seats looked like they got a great show. We were down closer but not at the stage. Had a fun night and my wife really liked the show. I grew up the Beatles and it brought back many fond memories. Thanks
Beatles Love,"Ok I love the Beatles but I really didnt know that they were way high man!!! I mean the show is a trip. Even a tribute to African Americans which I found odd and the pregnant lady, kinda weird, I felt like I was high and I wasnt but wow. There is so much going on from skaters to acrobats. The show is worth it. Amazing"
Beatles Love,"This show was non stop smiles! The music and sound system were great. The costumes were colorful. The sets were fun. The show exuded happy energy and such creativity. A blend of acrobatics and choreography, I highly recommend it if you want happy. Theater is small so the seats up a bit are great."
Beatles Love,"I saw the first rendition of the show 3 times and just saw the updated version.  I prefer the former but this wasnt that bad.  I could have done without the black American experience, as was seen in Lady Madonna, which to my knowledge was not written about a black woman.  Do the producers think that if they had a black vignette in the show that black people would see the show?  Cant we enjoy a show without racial politics being shoved down our throats?

I liked the opening number in the old show--it hit you like a freight train.  This opening was more tame.  I miss I am the Walrus.  No need to see this version again."
Beatles Love,"This is the most boring of the Cirque shows. Theres only 2 cool circus type acts, the swing and the rollerblades. The rest is just random stuff and Beatles songs, its really not that good. I got sleepy at one point, there was a really chill song playing and they were just blowing bubbles, that was the circus act, bubbles. 

And this is the most expensive Cirque show too...Why? Paying for the rights to all those songs prolly. Anyways it was ok overall. 

Id rather watch all the other ones before this one tho."
Beatles Love,"What a show! Definitely something I will never forget! A great show to see even if you arent a fan of The Beatles. The music is great and the arena you are in for the show makes the show even better. It is an in-the-round stage which makes every seat a good one. It is a clean show, so you could bring young kids if you wanted to."
Beatles Love,"We got 2 for the price of 1 tickets to the show on the balcony which I think are better seats than the lower bowl as you can see the activity around and below you.  There were curtains dividing the stage but they are removed for most part of the show.  Two large screens along the sides of the theatre are cool for Beatles video. 

Im a Beatles fan so I really enjoyed the music loud and great sounding. Having been to other Cirque shows, I wasnt sure what to expect.  But I liked the mix of dancing and acrobatics and less of the comedy than other shows.  Love started off more fun with lots of activity and lots of performers to watch.

There were a few songs that I really enjoyed including Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds with the bling and aerials.  Here Comes the Sun was another favourite of mine.  I also liked how they incorporated some imagery on the screens of the Beatles talking.  

No photos and recording are allowed in the theatre and although there wasnt security to be seen, we saw at least 2 people caught and told to delete the photos from their phone and tablet.

Great show with lots of props, colour, and diverse performers.  A great 90 minute show for $120US for 2."
Beatles Love,"Wow! This show was exceptional. The stage was in the center of the theater, which made it a nice viewing experience from most angles. I would definitely not recommend sitting very close to the stage as the stage is nearly at eye level and much of the action is at higher levels. The drinks were actually reasonably priced. The music was amazing, the technology (use of holograms and powered lights and tricycles) was really interesting, and the acrobatics and stunts were wonderful. At times it appeared to be almost psychedelic, giving me the impression that perhaps hallucinogenics were popular in that era. Regardless, it seemed very appropriate for children and several children even had roles in the show. The seats were very comfortable. People were singing and clearly enjoying themselves. I was so happy we chose to see Love, it was well worth the money!"
Beatles Love,"What a great show! I surprised my fiancé with tickets to this show since it was the one she really wanted to see. While Im not entirely familiar with ALL of the Beatles music, my fiancé is and she definitely enjoyed it. 

To me, it seemed more of a Jabbawockeez-style type of show with all of the dancing/break dancing routines.... Mystere and KA seemed to showcase more of a true high-flying and acrobatics routine that I think Cirque is more known for. 

I was surprised there were a lot of empty seats in the theater... but I believe since February is an off-season for Vegas, Im sure they do get packed in the summer time like most shows do. 

Our seats were in section 205, row N, seats 4 and 5... our view was great. Id upload our view, but they prohibit photos of the stage.

I still had a great time... and so did the guy next to me. So if youre a Beatles fan, book some tickets to come see this show!"
Beatles Love,"This is my favorite Las Vegas show.  We had front row seats and characters definitely engaged with us and crowd.  This was our third time seeing Beatles Love .  Although the show has changed a bit, not as fun as the original.  It was still mesmerizing"
Beatles Love,Best cirque! Def recommend !! Everything was perfect from music to the ambience!! this is a must see!!!!!!!
Beatles Love,"I was not a super Beatles fan until after seeing this production of Love. Just outstanding and I have been reading through the lower than 5 star reviews wondering how anybody regardless of taste (or lack of taste) could give this marvelous production anything but 5 stars. 

Another great production from the worlds top live entertainment company.  Cirque du Soleil, the food and shopping is the only reason to go to Vegas."
Beatles Love,"Third time is the charm! Saw the show for the third time and enjoyed every minute of it. Its definitely a show that is different, depending on where you sit in the theatre.

Went with some friends that have not seen the show. Fortunately they purchased great seats!
Anything near Row S is ideal.  I last saw the show when it first came out and I had heard that the show had recently changed.  It was fabulous!

The only disappointment was that the snack bar was not able to sell beer that night. The dispenser was out of CO2...Food and beverage prices are steep, but it was a nice treat to have snacks and drinks during the show."
Beatles Love,Super creative.  The music made the show.  Gold circle seats the best but all seats great. You can BYOB.  No issues in or out.  Courteous staff.  Drinks super expensive.  However frozen Moscow Mule super good.
Beatles Love,Of all the 6+ Cirque shows I have seen this is by far the least impressive.  There were few acrobatic circus acts with a lot of filler and dancing.  I love the Beatles music but this also had a decidedly anti-Christian/Church and Government leaning to it.  Saw Mysterie the same night and it was far more impressive.
Beatles Love,"It wasnt that the music wasnt exquisite. The music itself was amazing and the sound was crystal clear.  It wasnt that the performers didnt perform stupendous feats.  They did.  It was that the music never truly married the stunts, and the circus aspect fought, fought too hard, for hours, the distinctive music instead of marrying it.  

It needed nuance, which was to be found in this viewers opinion only in the Here Comes the Sun dance, which was beautiful and graceful.  The brief outtakes projected of the actual Beatles footage after the show was more impactful than the overkill show itself.  

More was not more.  Wanted to love LOVE, and left feeling like it was not an homage, but rather a spectacle with bravado but lacking in soul.  Someone sold out."
Beatles Love,"One of the best shows from Cirque du Soleil. If you like Beatles music, you must do this before any other. The athletes are great and get all over the place. Theres no spot with a thing moving at all times. If you want to appreciate it completely you should buy a ticket in the back or middle. If you want to get the experience and interact with the actors, then you can seat in the front. You can take no flash pictures and have lots of fun. Dress properly. Dont forget to buy souvenirs, they are unique and really cute!"
Beatles Love,Amazing show!! With a very lively cast and amazing concept. Would 100% recommend for anyone to go! Also spend some extra money if you want and be on the lower section for fun interaction with the performers and awesome views!
Beatles Love,"I am a big Beatles fan. I have also had the soundtrack album for this show for years before finally getting a chance to actually see the show. I was very excited to finally go. Call me biased, call me the right audience for this show, whatever. This show is amazing!

As soon as you walk in youre immersed in Beatles history. A huge multi-colored light up walkway takes you towards the bar serving several Beatles-themed cocktails. Entering the arena (in the round) youre confronted by four large sheets with projected images of the Beatles on them. In the background you can hear mostly instrumental Beatles songs, which put me in the mood to hear an hour and a half of Beatles music. They did exactly what I would have done; they played almost exclusively Beatles songs NOT featured in the show itself, which I appreciated.

Everything about the pre-show sets you up for the fun and exhilarating show to follow. An actor walking in the crowd snuck behind an audience member and sat in his seat before he could. It was this type of unnecessary fun that made the entire experience fantastic. The show itself starts with a haunting display of acrobats slowly descending from the ceiling and ascending from the floor on wires in slow motion to the song Because but only the vocals.

Soon after the show bursts to life. I wont ruin it for you. You should go see it. There was so much visual spectacle happening at once that my girlfriend and I often didnt even know which amazing stunt to look at! A note: watch the guy on the swing high above the stage, it will make your heart stop. I was overwhelmed by the amazing acrobatics happening in front of me. The people at Cirque know how to dazzle."
Beatles Love,"3.5 stars.  Still not sure what to even say about this experience!
The music, the colors, the dancing and acrobatics were amazing.
Did not give it a higher score for several reasons: they had see through curtain screens that are up for different parts of the performance and you actually miss part of the acrobatics and dancing.  Mind you this isnt based on bad seating either because there doesnt really seem to be a bad seat in the house.
Second if you are in the first 2 sections there is a point where a large tarp like sheet comes over you.  Its flapping around and if it get a loose and not right over you be prepared to be smacked in the face.  One corner hit my eye and I sat there with my hands around my eyes until it was over to prevent it from happening again.
If you are claustrophobic or PTSD you may not want to be under the tarp so plan ahead.  Now, with that being said it is also frustrating that you pay for tickets and dont get to see the show when the tarp is over you.  I guys they figure the experience is worth it.
Overall good show, upbeat music, and choreography."
Beatles Love,"3 stars

I like the Beatle theme &amp; playlist for the whole show. the whole show was kind of telling a story, but there wasnt a lot of interesting acts."
Beatles Love,"If you like the Beatles, stop, youll love this.  If you like Cirque Du Soleil, stop, youll love it.  If you can see can remember anything from the 60s, stop, youll flash back!
Its a multimedia production using the music of the Beatles as the thread to move acrobatics, costumes, light and video thru your eyes.  To bad this aint Colorado or Washington!  Lol. Very Psychedelic ! 
Remember to allow time to pick up your tickets from Will Call, at least an hour before.  We were able to grab a snack at California Pizza Kitchens in The Mirage with less than an hour before show time.   
Love, love, love!
Next, Id like to see a Rolling Stones Cirque Du Soleil.  Why not?"
Beatles Love,"I didnt see the show.  I have seen jt twice b4, and it is absolutely GREAT!  Being of the age I am A major BEATLES fan.  This show does them justice. 

What I did see yesterday was the MAGICAL TECHNICAL TOUR.  It is a free show which, I believe, runs Sat afternoon, thru the end of this month.  So, hurry up if U want to see it.  Its FREE!

It is a 30 minute behind the scenes look at the LOVE show.  It isnt too technical, just lightly brushes on the sound, lighting, and projection systems, as well as the incredibly elaborate stage elevator system (about a dozen moving sections!).  You are seated in the theatre, and a host narrates, providing lots of fun facts and trivia about the show.   

Its a very cool, interesting, half hour break. 
I recommend it - but, HURRY!"
Beatles Love,"Attended early August 2016, 9:30 showing. Our seats were about 6 rows back from the stage; next time Id like to sit a bit farther back, but we had a great view of everything on the stage and were able to interact with the performers (so cool!). 
Ill admit this was the first Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen, but it wont be the last. This show was absolutely incredible: the music, booming from the seats around you, is of course wnderful. But the performances were beyond anything I expected (and my expectations were REALLY high). The Octopus Garden scenes with glowing jellyfish and the While my Guitar Gently Weeps sequence where a female dancer interacts with an animated beau were my favorites, but the roller skaters shouldnt be overlooked either! 
The tickets werent cheap, but they were worth every penny. I cant wait to go back and see it again!"
Beatles Love,Love this show!!! Amazing production and I have to say Im not a fan of the Beatles but pleasantly surprised to find out how many of their songs I know!
Beatles Love,"There is nothing more I can say about this show that hasnt already been said.  It was a beautiful, intricate, immersive feast for the eyes.  

I do have to point out a few things to help you choose from the many different Cirque shows in Las Vegas at any one time.

1. You will enjoy this show 10x more if you are Beatles fan.  They excerpt part of the Beatles Sessions/Beatles Anthology with speaking parts from their recording sessions.  They fake you out a few times with that.  If you dont know the music, you will still probably like it, but I think knowing the songs helps you understand the context of some of the aspects of the show.

2. This is not a terribly aerial or acrobatic show.  Dont get me wrong, there are acrobatics in the show and some of them are cool to watch, but you will not get the gravity defying acrobatics that you might see in some of the other shows.  This show is all about the music and the songs.  They tell stories and they dance.  And oh do they dance.  If you are a fan of dance, you will love this show.  I would describe it as more acrobatic ballet. 

3.  There really is not a bad seat in the whole place, but if you sit in one of the lower sections, you will be able to participate in the audience participation part of the show which is hella cool and if you have kids, they will really love it.  The scale of the online seating chart is misleading.  It is a pretty small theatre and you will not miss out on anything or have any obstructions if you sit higher up.  I would recommend section 209 if you can get it.  It is where I sat and I had an excellent perspective. 

4. The staff was very professional and friendly.  I bought my tickets online and was not given the opportunity to select a seat.  The seat I was assigned was next to a young couple who were obviously trying to impress each other because they smelled like they had very literally taken a bath in cologne and perfume.  It gave me such a headache, I got up and asked the aisle section attendant if I could possibly be reseated, especially since it didnt seem like it was going to be a sold out show.  I explained why I wanted to be reseated and she seemed to understand.  Not only was she able to reassign me a new seat, it was in a better section, closer to the action.  I am extremely grateful, otherwise Im not sure I could have enjoyed the show.

5.  Dont even think about trying to sneak a photo.  They have people monitoring the sections and if you get caught, they will ask you to leave."
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque de Soleil show, and I had the pleasure of taking it in with a trapeze aerialist who could view the show with a critical eye that I lacked as a layman. 

The high scores on here are well-deserved. The show was an amazing combination of visual delights, aerial stunts, special effects, and classic Beatles tunes. Im not even a die-hard Beatles fan, but after seeing the show I have a new appreciation.

My favorite sequence: Something in the Way She Moves. One of the most beautiful scenes Ive seen... it was absolutely breathtaking.

Worth seeing, worth paying more for better seats, though there really arent bad seats for this... but the experience up close and personal is really something."
Beatles Love,"LOVE is a lot like being at a concert, watching a band you enjoy, wondering what theyll play next, hoping theyll play your favorite song.  As impressive as the set list is they just cant get to everything, much like a real band.  The songs that are here, however, are elevated in such a way that you will leave satisfied no matter what.

Ill be honest, Ive never been a big Beatles fan. Im still not.. But I thought this show was fantastic. Ive only seen a few Cirque shows but this is definitely my favorite so far.
I was lucky enough to get a floor seat a few rows away from the stage so I felt totally immersed in the action, with performance seemingly taking place from all sides of me, especially overhead.  The theater is set up such a way that I think you would have an awesome experience anywhere you sit, though.  The stage is in the middle with the seats surrounding it like an arena.

Beatles music melds seamlessly with audio clips from the news and pop culture, sound effects, and minimal character lines. 

Like all Cirque shows, the acrobatics and light spectacles are phenomenal. There are some really great set pieces, which I will not spoil, but let me tell you, you will be amazed.  Its the sort of show that, if you let it, will take you away to another place. The carefully placed music and lighting, along with the brilliant choreography paints a unique live action picture of the world according to the Beatles music. There seems to be an interesting story too if you pay attention, commenting on aspects of history, and pop culture from the time the music was produced.

Honestly, Im surprised I have been able to describe this much to you. Its a seriously triply show (in a good way), and words dont come close to the stuff youll be treated to in this theater."
Beatles Love,"One of the best shows Ive ever seen. First off the seats are amazing, no matter where you sit you are very close to the stage. Some people might not like this because this isnt a typical cirque du soleil b/c it isnt very stunty/acrobatic like normal. However there is some of that with a variety of lights, sets, props, ballet, breakdancing, giant tvs, makeup, dance, humor, costumes. Its kinda a little bit of everything and I thought what a great tribute to the Beatles it was. They had a great variety of their songs thru the years told thru the decades of London. It was a mash-up kind of show which perfectly fits the Beatles wide-ranging sound, talent, and audience. The show was done with a great energy and spirit."
Beatles Love,"Good but very loud
Cirque du Soleil has amazing productions, and Ive seen several-my absolute favorite is O at the Bellagio, but I had high hopes for the Beatles love. It was just as expensive, and perhaps even more intimate staging, but while I love the Beatles songs my expectations were above the actual."
Beatles Love,"I guess I expected a lot from Cirque being as this was my first show to see in Vegas. Beatles LOVE just did not have the WOW factor that I would have imagined. Nothing was over the top as far as acrobatics went. The show was more choreographed on the ground to the beats of Beatles music. I think O may have been more of my cup of tea.

TIP:
I would sit a little bit higher up just to view everything on stage. People expect closer seats to be amazing, but your viewing angles are bad and not worth the price you pay IMO."
Beatles Love,"I think this show is decent from CDS.   I would personally not pay full price for a ticket as La Reve is much much better show and I would be happy to pay full price for a ticket to La Reve!
More dancing than acrobats.   Loved the Beatle songs!!   I am confused why so many people thought it is a 5 star?   My wife thought the same way without me prodding her."
Beatles Love,"Let me start by saying this was a fun show with great music.  It helps that Im a Beatles fan.  I had to refrain from singing along (since I knew all the songs).

This is the second Cirque-like show Ive seen.  The first was Le Reve (we lucked into free tickets).  I have since learned Le Reve wasnt a Cirque show, but it definitely is Cirque-like.  So while I wouldnt classify myself as an aficionado, I do have a basis for comparison.  As my rating indicates, the show was OK.  It was enjoyable.  It was fun.  But it wasnt great.

First, the athleticism I saw in Le Reve was mostly missing from this show.  There was some acrobatics, but not nearly as much as I expected.  And on several occasions the action was almost frenetic.  It was difficult to focus on the performances because there was too much going on.  Le Reve did not suffer this problem.

Second, the story wasnt as clear as Le Reve.  It seemed almost like a lot of random stunts and tricks without much purpose.  Le Reve I could see the story they were telling.  I know the story of Sgt Pepper, but it was still hard to follow the story in this show.

So, even though I am a huge Beatles fan, I would recommend Le Reve before I would recommend this show.  The story was easier to follow, the show was more visually interesting, and the acrobatics were more impressive.  Only the music was better in this show, but if you already have the CDs you can listen to the music at home."
Beatles Love,"OK - the show is a FIVE. I dont deny that. The music and performance is the best Ive seen in Vegas. This show was just fantastic. The sound quality is amazing and THERE ARE NO BAD SEATS. Buy cheap seats safely, nothing much gained by moving up a level. Its a circular theater so you are in a good spot.

I just had to deduct a star for two reasons:

1) The concessions were atrocious. I can kind of accept that Im getting ripped for $12 popcorn, but at least pop the kernels. I could pay $15 for a jack and coke, just pour it fair. We paid $60 for two drinks, a pretzel, and a popcorn. The pretzel was awful, the popcorn uncooked, and the drinks weak. You gotta meet me halfway. So maybe just eat/drink first and avoid this.
2) The seats arent comfortable. They are oddly small. If youre 60+ its going to be tight. If youre bigger (Im a L/XL, around 61) and I had to basically cross my arms to stay off the seats beside me and I didnt even have room to cross my legs.

Thats just some feedback FYI - it is a GREAT show. By all means go see it, its wonderful and you wont regret it, just keep those two things in mind."
Beatles Love,"I am sure I am in the minority on this, but I just didnt really enjoy LOVE at all. I have seen all of the other Cirque shows in town and this is hands down my least favorite of them all.  

First off, I am not a die hard Beatles fan.  I like their music, and listen to it on the radio when it comes on, but by no means a fan.  I know some diehards and we almost had to break off our friendship when I told them I didnt like this show.

Secondly, I think you were supposed to take LSD or acid or something loopy to know what is going on.  Now all Cirque shows or at least the 5 I have seen are a little out there and require you to go on a crazy journey with them, but this was just too weird for me.  With LOVE though, I just felt I had missed a memo or something the entire show.  And the little shoes that walk out by themselves totally freaked me out and gave me a nightmare after seeing the show.

Thirdly, it was just way too much Beatles stuff.  Many of the things referenced parts of the Beatles history that a layperson probably wouldnt know or care about.  My diehard friends had to explain some of the things to me and it made a little more sense afterward I got the run down from them, but during the show I was just confused.

So please dont hate me, but I dont like this show.  There are a ton of Vegas shows I would recommend to my friends before this one.  So take it or leave it, but now you know my opinion."
Beatles Love,"Stunning production! Cant be more happy with my wifes choice to see this show. The seating was fantastic as every seat is good. Dont worry about where youre sitting because the show utilizes the entire theater as its spectacle. Theres so much to catch that at times you dont know where to look. 

A childhood favorite Lucy In The Sky of Diamonds was brought to life by beautiful acrobatics and light displays. It was simple but to the point, I absolutely loved it. The costumes are amazing and creative, full of color! Cirque definitely knows what its doing when it comes to productions as theyve always been above par. 

Do yourself a favor when going to Vegas and spend the money on these uniquely crafted shows. Itll be worth your time and a great experience. The minor shows on the strip are good if youre saving money, but definite time wasters. The real talent is at these shows and you wont be disappointed!"
Beatles Love,"Ome, omy.  Oh, how I loved LOVE to no end.  Now, Yelp Elites and muggles, listen here and listen good:  if you go to Las Vegas and you are going to choose one, just one, Cirque du Soleil show to see --just let it be LOVE.  Seriously, theres only one word to describe LOVE:  whatintheworlddidwejustwatchitwassofreakingexcellentletsdoitagaintilthesuncomesup.

^ Yeah, that word.  I have been to Vegas twice now, I have seen my fair share of Cirque (all but Criss Angel and Kā) and this, mdears, this one steals/slaughters/decapitates the entire line-up of Vegas Cirque set-up.  LOVE takes you on a magic carpet ride of mystery, fun, and whimsy.

It is the only Cirque show that Ive seen that I legitimately grinned from ear-to-ear the entire time that I was watching it.  Magnanimous, beautiful, awe-inspiring acts await you at the LOVE Theater inside of the beautiful Mirage hotel.

I feel so lucky that Ive seen this show; for I will never see a live performance that made me feel as happy as LOVE did.  It was the icing on the cake of an otherwise magical trip.  Just go, seriously, why are you even still reading this?  You should be buying your tickets.  NOW."
Beatles Love,"I am a huge Beatles fan, and I loved watching the music come to life.  Sadly, I was a little disappointed by the lack of grand acrobatics that Cirque du Soleil is known for.  There also wasnt a cohesive story that bonded all the vignettes together like in Iris, and I found myself searching for meaning where there was none.

I enjoyed the show and certain acts took my breath away (I mightve teared a bit at Something) but overall, not the best Ive seen from Cirque du Soleil."
Beatles Love,"Ive seen many Cirque shows in Vegas.  This show was entertaining, and the music was spectacular. My only complaints are that the stage becomes busy and you may miss something cool.  Also, the level of acrobatic routines were not (in my opinion ) at the same level as the Mystere show, which is my favorite if you like acrobatics."
Beatles Love,"Cirque Du Soleil - The Beatles Love show was truly eye opening and quite the captivating performance! 

Youre taken on a musical &amp; theatrical journey throughout the various Beatles eras.. From their Liverpool days, to the Ed Sullivan Show, to the Psychedelic time of Peace &amp; Love. 

The timeless yet catchy guitar riffs n rhythms along with the blissful unison of John &amp; Pauls vocals were a delight on the ears. Although they didnt play EVERY Beatles hit, they definitely covered enough ground to portray how much music the fab 4 tossed together and how much of an impact they had back then and today - all within the one hour and 45 minute show. 

Im kind of in between eras as far as my taste for the group goes. Im a fan of most the Beatles music, but Id say I prefer the simplistic She Loves You / Hold Your Hand time frame. My first school dance was at a roller rink and I Want To Hold Your Hand came on. My crush, Lauren, didnt have a partner.. The song blasted and expressed exactly what I was feeling at that moment.. so I rolled over on all 8 wheels and the rest was history. Our relationship IS history, but the song stuck with me and so did that era of The Beatles. So naturally when the song blasted.. I felt like I was on Ed Sullivan.. turning into a little 15 year old girl and started screaming at the top of my lungs.

They created a sound-of-light style show where the lights were of various colors and were coordinated to react to the music and those on stage. The auditorium is cylindrical with a circular stage directly in the middle. From what I can tell every seat in the building was decent and you really dont feel as if the performers are performing to one side of the room only. You truly FEEL the show with surround sound, gusts of air, floating props, flashy dancers on set busting moves as well as others on rafters above dancing and flying across the set. The performers were phenomenal; dressed from prim to rustic, posh to prissy, they definitely had the crowd groovin and up and out of our seats on more than one occasion! I felt various emotional stages; from my palms sweating to goosebumps and moments of pure awe. There were instances where it felt like my brain waves and positive vibes were oozing out of me towards the entire audience I could literally see it happening. Chill out, it was all visual &amp; SFX effects, of course, but my mind goes off into another world during performances as such.

Beginning to end I found myself cheering, singing, bobbing my head and clapping throughout each set. I left with a euphoric feeling and was in such a great mood that the partied continued on into the next day. Its worth checking out whether youre a Beatles fan or not!!"
Beatles Love,Worst show Ive ever seen. It was a shame they put the Cirque Su Soleil name on this show. I honesty felt like I paid $100 to watch a bunch of elementary school kids play in the play ground.. no talent what so ever. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Let alone for the 9 people in my party.
Beatles Love,"Hands down, THE Best Show I have ever seen live! If you have even the smallest interest in the Beatles, this is an absolute must! (I agree that it is not like the other Cirque shows but in my mind that is what sets it apart. It is more about the music and the story of the Beatles.) After the show ended I went back out to the box office and bought tickets for the next show! The attendants at the Box Office helped us with handicapped accessible seats as well as finding us coupons for the seats! Next time I am in Las Vegas I plan on attending the show again! It was FANTASTIC!"
Beatles Love,"Really, this is just a 3 star show given the vast library of amazing Beatles music and the $415 the 3 of paid for admission. 

Here are 5 reasons why this production received 3 stars for the show (+ 1 extra star because its the music of The Beatles.)

1) Its called Love, but it had little to do with love.
2) There was too much modern dance and too little circus.
3) There were some disturbing themes and decades old poli-social issues covered.
4) Audience interaction was minimal.
5) Tickets were over-priced.

I liked it because I knew every song and was able to sing along. For my son who doesnt know the music, the show wasnt really a wow. 

If I were to do it over again, Id go to the 1st showing of the evening when the theater is more full and buy tickets at a discount and not worry too much about getting the most expensive seats. I think the show would have been as nearly as enjoyable from the rear as it was from the front. Some shows are worth paying extra for premium seats. Not this one in my opinion. Would I recommend this show? Sure, but only if youre a Beatles fan."
Beatles Love,"Even though I was holding out to watch this show with a significant lover, I couldnt pass up the offer from my cousin to watch it with him and his buddies. And Im sooooooo glad that I did!

This show was TOTALLY awesome! Especially if you are a Beatles fan! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!! The crowd I was sitting next to were really into it clapping and singing along so you cant help but to feed off their energy.

But like all Cirque shows its hard to focus in on all the stuff thats going on on the stage. My minute brain capacity can only handle so much! However all the colors, sounds, vibrancy of it all just keeps you captivated the entire time. 

I WILL TOTALLY WATCH THIS SHOW AGAIN-and this time with a significant lover. ;)"
Beatles Love,"Celebrating our honeymoon, my new husband and I were so excited to see LOVE at the Mirage. Immediately impressed with the show unfortunately 20 minutes into it we were interrupted by security seating two incredibly intoxicated women next to us. They talked the entire time even after being asked nicely by several audience members to keep it down. I feel the Mirage should not have seated the women late (or served them alcohol despite after the show one of the women yelling at me THIS IS VEGAS). The show was amazing, unfortunately the rudeness of other patrons made this a bad experience."
Beatles Love,"Brilliant show!! From start to end it was totally incredible! If your a Beatles fan, youll love all the music and the the act even more! And if your just looking for a great night out, no way you wouldnt enjoy it too. Kudos to the entire crew. Way to honor one of the greatest Bands that ever existed. Thank you!"
Beatles Love,"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS... BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!  Completely exceeded my expectations.  The performers, lighting, sound, costumes, and 3D set design blew me away.  Top notch in every single way.  We had a blast... not to mention, I was completely  moved by the performances.  Thank you so much to the incredible cast and crew for making my trip Vegas a spectacular one.  You truly brought the magic of the music and the storytelling to life!  BRAVO!!!!!!!!!"
Beatles Love,"Defiantly not Cirque du Soleils best. The acrobatics were minimal and the show didnt really seem to flow at all. It almost seemed like they took a bunch of leftover scenery from other shows and threw it together with a Beatles greatest hits CD. 

If you insist on seeing this show, I wouldnt recommend throwing money away on premium seats, the auditorium is small so it shouldnt matter where you sit. I know if you bring your ticket from another Cirque show they will give you $55 to another show....that would probably be the best way to see this....you will probably feel like you didnt waste your money as much."
Beatles Love,"OK Beatles fans, open in a new window and sing along....

Beatles Love,Awesome.   Great visual experience. Not as much wow factor as O but very much worth the time and money.
Beatles Love,Great show. Great atmosphere. Only downfall was my seats had the railing right in front of it. Def dont sit in the first row of the section or you will have the same problem. The sound system this place has is amazing.
Beatles Love,"I have seen the show LOVE three times and each time I have seen something new!  The acts, dancing, stunts and most of all the music was awesome!  If you visiting Las Vegas the show LOVE is a must SEE!"
Beatles Love,"AMAZING!!!!! Specially if youre a Beatles fan! Must see! Only thing is the seats are very narrow. But other than that, it was amazing!!!"
Beatles Love,If you are a Beatles fan this is a must for you. Absolutely amazing show! The show runs 90 minutes. We were in section 206 and the seats were very close to the front of the show. Highly recommend Beatles Love- money well spent!
Beatles Love,"Amazing, just amazing. I really have no other words. Everyone needs to see this show. The music was great and the production was fantastic! The octopuss garden, the circus and rollerbladers, the trapeze couple, all amazing! I dont know how they do it!"
Beatles Love,"This show was a blast! So glad we decided to try it.  All the music, the dancing and the acrobatics were amazing.  We will definitely be back for this show."
Beatles Love,"Caveat - I grew up listening strictly to oldies. Specifically, the Beatles. Ive owned every Fab Four album and can sing along with any song. Needless to say, I was completely bowled over with this show. 

True, this Cirque show is different than others. The focus is equally on the music as it is on the acrobatic feats, and for many Cirque-lovers, that might not cut it. But if you love Cirque AND The Beatles, there is really nothing better. The music and moves are so artfully and remarkably paired that it is non-stop amazing-ness from the thrilling moment it begins until this sad moment it ends.

So many people have already summed up this show beautifully, so let me conclude with my favorite acts:
1) For the Benefit of Mr. Kite - amazing circus tricks, particularly the dude at the very top on the big hamster wheel thing. I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety hoping and praying he wouldnt fall to his death because those feats he performed were just too incredible. 

2) HELP - with the roller skaters! so, so, so much fun.

3) Octopus Garden - whimsical and lovely, loved the giant floating jellyfish.

4) Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - any act with the aerial silks is just beautiful, but this one really was the most magnificent display of elegance.

I sat in the back row but the surround-seating layout of the theatre made it seem like a very intimate performing area, so dont be disappointed if those are the only seats you can score."
Beatles Love,"This show was absolutely WONDERFUL. We werent really sure what to expect and we were beyond surprised with the creativity and the cast was excellent. This is basically a 90 minutes of Beatles music brought to life. We sat in the balcony, section 304 and honestly, there isnt a bad seat in the house. We liked being up top because we could see all the acrobats without having to constantly look up. This was my first cirque show but if the rest are anything like this one, well definitely be going to more!"
Beatles Love,"Amazing performance and incredible music, even if youre not familiar with The Beatles (which who isnt???) the show is super energetic and filled with stunt work."
Beatles Love,"This show would have gotten 5 stars if this would be labeled a show but calling it cirque de soliel ruins it! When you go to see a cirque show, you expect the crazy impressive acrobatics! Not a dance routine that you can do if you are taught the moves. However, if you want to come listen to Beatles music, this is the show. But Im disappointed that I paid all that money to watch people dance on stage whilst listening to a Beatles album. Not what I expected. Would never come back."
Beatles Love,"LOOOOOVED this show. Get seats in the 200 and up section to see more of the whole show and all the action. Youll really have to see it a couple of times. We sat in the 305 section and it was good but...a little too high up. Still enjoyed it as one of the greatest shows Ive seen. The ending was really emotional (for me at least) when it shows all the Members of the Beatles band who made this incredible music. 
Nothing in todays music comes close to the poetry and unique, honest, raw sound of poetry set to music. 
The performers were incredible. Seeing them with no safety lines on while doing stunts is surreal. 
I would go back to Vegas for no other reason than to experience this show. 
I bought my tix at a discounted price on Vegas.com. We heard if you go to the box office right before the show they sometimes comp tix just to fill it. 
We had 7 in our party and wanted to sit together so we didnt try that route. Prepare to be moved, mesmerized and delighted."
Beatles Love,"I had great seats and really really enjoyed this performance. The music was fantastic, loved all the actually recordings of John and Paul talking and loved every portion of the whole performance...blew me away ! 
Big Beatles fan and Im not sure how many songs they used, but it was outstanding ! There is no bad seat in this theatre, but I think the lower you can be seated the better, I sat in section 208 row L and it was great, but I would not sit in an aisle seat - more towards the middle and then you can see whats happening on all four sections. But it was outstanding !!"
Beatles Love,"This show was absolutely amazing! Pretty pricey per ticket, but they all are. The music was fantastic, the overall performance &amp; dances were great and we had a wonderful time. The only negative thing about the show was that the seats were VERY uncomfortable and the price of a small bottle of water was like almost $10. Crazy. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed the show &amp; would recommend everyone to see it."
Beatles Love,Best Cirque du Soleil  show Ive ever seen seen we just love the show and the theater is great... highly recommend this show
Beatles Love,"Yelp 100 Challenge * 45/100

I am a HUGE fan of The Beatles. Over the years, Ive memorized just about every one of their songs. Unfortunately, I wasnt born in time to watch them perform live. Beatles LOVE is about as close you could get to a great Beatles show with many acrobatic stunts and visuals that make their songs come to life. I wouldnt recommend just about everyone to watch it though, especially if youre not that big on Beatles - at least, pass this show off till youve watch other Cirque performances.

The shows soundtrack is a mash-up mix of many of the bands hits including Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Blackbird, St. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Back In The USSR, A Day In The Life and snippets of lesser known songs such as Blue Jay Way, etc. I was especially driven by the Taxman/Drive My Car/The Word trio mash up and Papa, whos an even bigger fan than me, had a big smile on his face the whole way through. Drapes, actual voices retrieved from old recording sessions and moving silhouettes of John, Paul, George and Ringo made it feel like they were actually there

Stunts were not as elaborate as the ones Ive seen at KA, O, or La Reve. However, this one reached the heart more than the others. I watched this show about 3 years ago and till today, theyre still playing at the Mirage. Stop by the gift shop after the show and get yourself a souvenir or even better, save the cash and get a picture by the jukebox and colorful hallway leading up to the theatre."
Beatles Love,"I heard great reviews about the show prior to seeing it. After seeing it, I was very disappointed. Dark and disjointed like a bad carney sideshow. It was like high budget performance art that is not good. Ive enjoyed many other Cirque productions with no complaint. Great performances and entertaining. This one was a waste of an evening. I do not recommend."
Beatles Love,"I was raised in a household that commonly played the Beatles. I love the Beatles. But this show... Meh. I wanted to love it, but it felt disjointed and lacking real wonder. 

1) Song selection - Top 10 most overplayed Beatles songs. I will never understand why they decided not to  include Across the Universe... 

2) Many people in the Yelp comments state, there are no bad seats. There are. The last four rows are not included in most of the effects, including the tent and confetti.

3) Storyline - One of the main issues I had was the flip-flop between abstract and linear narrative. It didnt work for me. Either completely abstract or real Beatles stories please. 

Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was a highlight and many of the performers were extraordinary. The man in red and black striped pants stands out for me. 

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I wouldnt recommend to friends."
Beatles Love,"100th Review! I saved LOVE just for this =). Really 4.5 stars.

If you dont already know, I am obsessed with The Beatles (no, seriously...). I was interested in how this show would pan out, given that other Cirque shows have a specific repertoire.

Despite the uniqueness of Cirque shows, what I enjoyed most about this one was that it was different. You could understand exactly what was going on. The tasteful cuts in music presented an understandable and easy story to follow.

Theater: It is a circular theater facing a stage in the middle. I sat more toward the back, but I could still see everything nicely. The outside is super colorful and makes for great photo ops.

The show: SO.MUCH.COLOR. Its impossible to be in a grumpy mood the whole way through this show (even if Im wrong, dont prove it to me please). The acrobatics were great, but some ran for a little longer than they should. I like the connection between the songs and the acts - Lady Madonna, Here Comes The Sun, and All You Need is Love being my favorites. 

Service : Ushers Sgt. Pepper costumes? Ahhhhh yes. They were very helpful and fun to approach/look at.

Docking a 1/2 star because it is a bit pricey. You can try finding deals outside or if you stay at the Mirage.

Overall, out of all the Cirque shows, Id recommend this one. I could just be biased considering my love for the band, but Im sure youll walk away from it happy."
Beatles Love,"The music was excellent. The acrobatics were good. A bit psychedelic at times. The production was incredible. It was a little hard to follow, sometimes. Very entertaining over all. I would like to go again."
Beatles Love,"First Cirque du Soleil show ever and I was really into this one because of the whole Beatles theme. BUT, I dont know that I would go to watch another one after this. It was really entertaining but also kind of exhausting... almost like... I wish i was some kinda high because my drunk mind was just overwhelmed with colors and jumping things... and trampolines and rollerskating and a sad elenor rigby and it was just a LOT to look at/focus on. Nonetheless, still very cool and entertaining... a lot of gasping going on... Im not that into dangerous stunts and theres a lot of flying around and boinging and floating throughout the show.

Their drinks are REALLY SWEET! We got a margarita, a red drink and a orangy drink... i think they were called.... hard days night and hello goodbye... or something Beatles related. The best of the three was the orange (colored) one... which was like... pineapple and mango or something tropical, DONT get the other ones youll get diabetes."
Beatles Love,"This is one of the best, most entertaining shows I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life. So much fun! I cant even describe how good it is. So much fun. OMG WORTH EVERY PENNY! The top level seats or the bottom seats- it doesnt matter! 

A lot of celebrities attend this show as well! Ive seen them up close after the crowd leaves in the main lobby. 

AMAZZZZZZING! OH MY GOD! I must go back soon!"
Beatles Love,"The epitome of an amazing show. 

The best Cirque show, hands down and around. One of the best shows, period. And Ive seen a LOT of shows in my lifetime. Arent all Cirque shows the same, you may ask? The answer is no! This show focuses less on glorified circus tricks and brings more LIFE to the dances and acts, making the experience more REAL.

LOVE is different. It is moving and meaningful. Set around the World War II period, the show really captures the mood of the era. The music is all the Beatles tunes you grew up singing and tapping your feet to. The performers dances and acts are so easy to relate to and the room is flooded with such a heightened sense of emotion. The show is also so much FUN! There are many acts that completely blew my mind, and others filled me with such joy (some acts did both!).

Unlike almost every show Ive ever seen, every seat in the house IS a good seat. The theater is structured such that it has a very communal feel, and enhances that sense of community during the way cool audience participation section -- dont worry, its nothing that puts you on the spot at all. 

During LOVE, I lost sense of time and thought (and hoped) it would never end. After leaving the show, I felt like I was walking on air.


TIP: Although this show may be costly, it is definitely worth it. This is the #1 show Ive ever attended in Vegas. For your reference, 2nd place goes to Avenue Q -- anything that erases lines of political correctness is awesome in my book!"
Beatles Love,"My first Cirque experience, and most definitely wont be the last. Was in town for business and decided to go to the show being a huge Beatles fan and having known about the show for years. This year also being their 10th anniversary theyve announced theres added new features. Went to the show solo and instantly made friends with the friendly Beatles/Cirque fans who had been to multiple shows but said this was their favorite. We sat in the balcony and had an amazing view of the show. The sound system in the theatre is amazing! Of course, no phones were allowed to be used during the show. Everything about the show was perfect. There was so much more than just acrobatics and dancing it was great. The visuals on the screens and on the curtains really added to the effects. Also, the Beatles shop outside the theatre had tons of great merch prices for any budget. Will definitely be seeing this show again."
Beatles Love,"Two things I love - Cirque and the Beatles - have been combined so artfully to form a show that absolutely blew me away.  Cirque fills me with awe and wonderment and, although this show was vastly different from other Cirques Ive seen there was no difference in how amazed I was by it!  

The theater set-up, a sort of 360 seating arrangement around the stage, confused me when I first saw the layout.  We bought our seats and I wondered, how could such a layout possibly keep me engaged?  Well it did, maybe even more so than some of the other Cirque shows.  The action was all around but I couldnt help but feel that it was all facing me.  Im sure anyone around this cleverly laid out circle would feel the same.  

The music was incredible.  How could it not be?  Its the Beatles!  I dont know how youd feel if you arent a Beatles fan.  Maybe it would just be an exceptional show with music you arent familiar with.  You might not identify with the music as powerfully but, if youre like my husband, you might enjoy it immensely nonetheless.   

Some of the acts arent your typical Cirque but theres a story line that stays at the forefront of the show and the props and costumes are perfectly chosen for the Beatles era.

Theres no doubt I will see the show more than once and Im sure I will notice new and exciting things about it.  I LOVED this show.  And... all you need is love."
Beatles Love,"Outrageous. This is the best show i have ever seen. Beatlemania continues to live on through generations through its music. 1 1/2 hours of nonstop thrills and great music, 120$ well spent and got more than i bargained for. You can count on me the next time i am in Vegas i will return for an encore."
Beatles Love,"All you need is love. 

Love. 

Love. 

Love is all you need.

Fans of the Beatles should absolutely see this show.  Its an amazing tribute of their work. The storyline is loose, but tells you how the band got together, their psychedelic experiences in the 60s and their break-up in the 70s.  All throughout the show, interpretations of their famous songs like Here Comes the Sun, Strawberry Fields, etc. come alive.  Sergeant Pepper is a central character in the show.  

Unlike Ka or O, there isnt a live orchestra here, but the pre-recorded music blends seamlessly from one song to the next.  The built-in speakers on your seat make sure you fully enjoy the music (or at least dont fall asleep!) Although there are acrobatics here, dont expect full on craziness like Ka. 

There really isnt a bad seat in the house, the best ones in my opinion are in the section 200 (the middle part).  Youll appreciate that fact when the bed scene comes. Its truly a wonderful sight!

This was my very first Cirque show and Ive now seen it twice -- outstanding the first time and still wonderful as ever."
Beatles Love,"Out of the 4 different cirque shows Ive seen in Vegas, this is by far my favorite. Ive seen it twice, and would willingly see it again!  The music, choreography, and acrobatics are all absolutely amazing!"
Beatles Love,I was very very disappointed. Ive seen couple of circus du soleil before and this one was awful. Wasted our money traveling to Las Vegas and wasted our money watching Beatles
Beatles Love,This was a really fun show -  I absolutely loved it- so much going on and so much beautiful talent!!
Beatles Love,"Save your money!! What a waste of $150! Been to several CdS shows but 90 min of my life was wasted on this rip off. Girls twirling from cables, trampolines, guys on roller skates, girls on swings, some creepy ballet thingy, people dancing around on a stage...all the same cirque schtick Ive seen before just with different stupid costumes set to loud beatles music. Would have gotten 10x more joy from a good steak and lobster!

Should have been clued in when the 7 pm show was coming out of the theater and not one smile from anyone coming out of there..no one talking. Looked more horrified they just wasted good money. Dont bother."
Beatles Love,"Amazing. My biggest problem, its not long enough. I LOVE the Beatles, they need to make the show longer. Im paying a good amount to see cirque shows so I want to make sure Im getting my moneys worth. I also had a problem with the way they expressed the songs, if you watch Across The Universe, they are so creative with the lyrics, especially on Mr Kite. Otherwise, great drinks and a fun way to spend a nice night with a loved one."
Beatles Love,This is hands down the best show ive ever been too! Even if youre not a beetles fan (hard to not to be) youll enjoy it. There was constant action the entire time. The amount of acrobatics was amazing and impressive. We got a great deal on our seats but this show was so good id have paid double! We had ages ranging from 9 to 80 yrs old &amp; everyone had a wonderful time.
Beatles Love,"I had the pleasure of seeing Love during a recent visit to Vegas with my fiance.  I must admit that I was a little put off at first due to the fact that it was a little on the pricey side, but after asking some friends about their experiences, I decided to go ahead and give it a go.

My fiance and I have seen KA, Blue Man Group, Mystere and Zarkana prior to this and we both sat in awe at the end of LOVE.  This is, hands down, my favorite Vegas show!  The production did a great job conveying the messages and emotions of the Beatles music and the era.  There was a lot going on between the dancing, acrobatics and music and I think that is why I loved it so much.  Definitely fun from beginning to end.

We sat a section away from the stage and thought it was a great view, but the seating allows for any section to be able to view the stage nicely. 

If youre thinking about a show to watch during your next visit to Sin City, I definitely recommend this one!"
Beatles Love,"Fan-freaking-tactic. We had a big group out in Vegas for our wedding and we chose to see Love because we love Beatles music and were staying in the Mirage. It was phenomenal. Each song had a story told by the performers. They are so unbelievably talented. The two hours flew by. You can bring drinks in as long as they are in plastic cups (we got slushy drinks from a little place close to the entrance). 
My husband made the comment this is an ADD persons dream come true! because there is so much going on at once!!! It wasnt overwhelming, though. I would see it again in a heart beat. Two thumbs way up."
Beatles Love,"I thought this was the best show that Ive ever seen and Ive seen a lot of shows.  There was something going on all the time and I didnt know what to look at first. The show was so creative and unique compared to other Cirque shows. The stage set up, lights, costumes were very unique. The theater was very comfortable and has a mystical look to it. Just an amazing show."
Beatles Love,"Amazing and beautiful show at The mirage. Ive seen the show 3 times, each from 3 different places In the theater and all times it was incredible. In fact, theres so much going on during the Show that you truly see an entirely different show each time. 

 All of the actors truly seems to love doing what theyre doing and the interpretation of the music is none like Ive seen in a show before. I would recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas."
Beatles Love,"First and foremost, I am a huge Beatles fan. Ive also been wanting to come to this show for years, and had not. Even through multiple stays at Mirage. So when the time finally came, I had high expectations. They were met.

Our tickets, purchased the morning of from Tix4Tonight, were great. Section 207, Row P found us seemingly 30 feet from the stage. In fact, I think the 100 level seats might be too close, as you would miss things happening along the periphery. Like most shows, its often just as interesting to see whats happening outside of the light as under it. 

The 1.5 hour show was full of great music, a good amount of acrobatics, wonderful dance, and just pure entertainment. Choreography and originality were spot on, and the engineering of the show was beautiful. 

Only knock is that it leaned heavy on the later stuff - late 60s rather than earlier music which I prefer. But thats a very, very minimal criticism."
Beatles Love,"All you need is LOVE!

I am a huge fan of cirque du soleil shows and Im an even huger fan of the beatles. Ive been dying to watch this show since forever. To put it into context, I have watched totem, zumanity, ka, and Zarkana and this show blows all of them out of the water!

This theater definitely has one of the nicest lobbies and I really recommend you take photos here before the show starts because it gets crazy packed. The theater itself is small and intimate, I highly recommend the areas that are right across from the screens because they really set the mood. Also, every chair has a built in speaker so the music you hear is crisp to perfection.

I was moved by every single act. From the moment I heard the iconic string strum in A hard days night, I was hooked! I have to admit, being a huge beatles fan really helps because you can immerse yourself in the lyrics and the recognize the time period undertones. The show is very deep compared to the other shows and it tackles racism, the berlin wall, heart breaks, and world war 2. Its not the most acrobatic or jaw dropping show rather its the most immersive show. 

In order to not reveal spoilers, some of my favorite acts were Lucy in the sky, black bird, Something and Hey Jude. This show is a visual and audio overload, so much going on the stage at a time! Basically, I was grinning ear to ear through out the whole show. I had a really hard time getting beatlemania out of my head. :).

Overall, hands down the best Cirque Du Soleil show Ive ever watched!"
Beatles Love,"This was my second Cirque de Soleil show and it was very entertaining! If youre a fan of The Beatles, then you would absolutely love this show. Its a full 90 minutes of songs, acts, and dancing. The seating of the theater circled a full 360 around the stage, so every seat should have gotten a good view of the show. We sat in section 205 row N, and the view was perfect. It was far enough back to see everything going on, but close enough so that you dont feel distant from all the performers. I would recommend sitting in a similar section. 

There is a concession stand where you could buy drinks and popcorn, but be sure to come a little earlier because the lines do get long! If youre not in your seats by show time youll have to wait like 5 minutes into the show to sit down. If you have your mlife players card, I believe you get a little discount on your purchase. 

The show itself was amazing. The only thing I would complain about was that their wasnt as much acrobatics and keep you on the edge of you seat acts. But for the amount of space they had, they were able to do some crazy acts! Nonetheless, the show was very entertaining. It told a story of an era in a very theatrical and awe inspiring way. Would definitely recommend people to see it."
Beatles Love,"I have seen all of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas as well as all of the traveling ones. I have also seen many other productions such as Blue Man Group, Beauty and the Beast, Titanic, Grease, Sigfried and Roy, etc, etc, etc. 

This is absolutely the most phenomenal show that I have ever seen, bar NONE!

Dont listen to the knuckleheads below giving 4 stars because of the lack of acrobatics. Not only are there plenty of those in this show, THEY ARE UNIQUE. If youre like me, you dont like the fact that some other Cirque shows are basically nothing more than glorified circus acts. I like shows that show me something I havent seen before and tell a story with awesome costumes and effects... if I want acrobatics, there are Shows Ad Nauseum enough for that already.

I was concerned about seeing this show before booking it since even though it was a Cirque show, it just seemed like kind of a campy idea... I mean the Beatles and Cirque... dumb. 
But, Wow! From the word Go! this production grabs your senses and just doesnt let up. 
Amazing- no where near enough.
Breathtaking- getting there for sure.
Awe-inspiring- okay, 
maybe... 
Emotionally... Erect, would be better. 

I was concerned about the seats, but I think we had the best ones in the house. Section 204 Row O seats 15 and 16 were awesome. Youre just above the level of the parachute trick so you can see over it and enjoy the whole effect.
Others are right, though. This show takes place all around and above you, so there are no bad seats in the house. (Except maybe for the front rows... cant imagine looking up for an hour and a half, but even those are amazing because the act is right there... they could have touched them if they reached out. Also, the 2nd floor seats are cheaper than the 1st floor and theyre just way better seats.

Dont worry about Sore Ass Syndrome at this production. This is one of the few shows where you are actually extremely disappointed when its over. Usually, I am half way out the door by the time the first ovation ends, running to be the first one out. But I found myself cheering in amazement and not caring that I would have to be elbow to elbow with masses of human goo fighting to get out of the theater momentarily. It was that good. (It actually wasnt that bad getting out.)

Unfortunately for the guys, this is a  very family friendly show... you wont even accidentally see up an errant nighty hem on the sexy performers. Dont worry though, its amazing enough even to entertain the most voyeuristic Las Vegan for a couple hours. 

If I could give this show 10 stars, it wouldnt be enough. If I had paid double what I paid, I would not have felt ripped off.
For the firs time ever, I cant WAIT to go see this show again!"
Beatles Love,"My FAVORITE thing to do in Vegas!!!! I am a huge Beatles fan so this show is everything I could ask for. Just wait until the curtain drops after the first song!! It has more dancing than acrobatics but still very entertaining. I wish it was longer!

Ive seen it twice, once in the very back and once in the very front - both views are fantastic and I really dont have a preference. The audience sits in the middle of the show so theres a lot going on /everywhere/ like all around you. I was worried when I sat in the front that I would be craning my neck to see whats going on the in the air but I worried for nothing. Theres also a SURPRISE that happens during the show and I was afraid that sitting in the front, I wouldnt get much of a view BUT it was even cooler being there than in the back! It was very psychedelic... Youll see what I mean when you see the show. Every seat has a good view (in my opinion).

I recommend going earlier in the day if you want to buy souvenirs because it gets super crowded right before and after the show. If you end up loving the show, I also recommend buying the soundtrack because, even though its the same songs you probably already have, its mixed so brilliantly (BY THE SIR GEORGE MARTIN BTW) that youll hear the songs in a whole new way. For example, For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, I Want You (Shes So Heavy), and Helter Skelter all mixed into one song... What!

Also, the snack bar is pretty cool. They have tasty cocktails named after Beatles songs, candy, popcorn, and other stuff. Ive noticed that I buy snacks but I dont even eat them because Im so engrossed in the show!

Also also, I love the fact that the show was kind of George Harrisons idea and Paul/Ringo/Yoko/Cynthia and Julian Lennon/Olivia and Dhani Harrison/Apple Corps Ltd approve of &amp; support it. Makes it ~that~ much more special.

TLDR; See the show."
Beatles Love,"The show was pretty entertaining and with our 200 seats it was still a great view. The acrobatics In my opinion were amazing, especially the guy with the ladder. The audience engagement was spot on. The only reason why I didnt give them 5 stars was because to me the story line didnt make sense and maybe that is because I like the beatles but I am their biggest fan like a lot of the crowd was. It was a great, entertaining show and gave us something to look forward to for the day so I say give it a shot! I would love to see another cirque show to have something to compare it to."
Beatles Love,"Interesting show. All Beatles music. Mostly during the psychotic era. Cirque du soleil show but from what Im told, its not quite like it. Mostly dancing. Still the acrobatics was good. Sorry fell asleep during one song."
Beatles Love,"Does listening to certain Beatles songs cause of tingling in your arms or on the back of your neck?Cirque de Soleil always delivers- until this dud appeared trading on the undeniable charm and depth of the Beatles catalog. 

I have been to more than 5 Cirque shows and have always been overwhelmed with wonder and emotion. This show left me wondering how they could have messed up a slam dunk production with such a great set of music to choose from.  Perhaps I am biased in that I never liked the Sargent Peppers genre, (the movie,  I love the  music).  Love has a sergeant Pepper trippy, bizarre vibe which follows the story of Sgt. Pepper and his band of street characters. The set Is a cross between 19th century London and dark Alice in Wonderland which uses 360 degree videos from the Beatles first tv appearances with giant video screens behind the audience as an enhancement to the live performers, 

Perhaps they were trying to save money on the extensive use of live performers that are required for typical Cirque productions, but the audio &amp; video made the performance mechanical and cold. In this age where we rely so much on video for our entertainment, the Beatles vids were disappointing. 

The show contained some of the usual Cirque du Soleil acrobatics however it was more trampolines and jumping from suspended platforms then anything truly interesting. Due to the small size of the auditorium and extensive reliance on video, I believe they were unable to include more of the truly amazing acrobatics in this production. 

One tip-off  that I shouldve picked up on was the audience was about half full on a peak night, it made me wonder how this show is still surviving? perhaps Mirage doesnt want to invest the millions of dollars it requires for a new show and is trying to milk this investment. Certainly it looks like they put a lot in developing the audio and video screens in this theater, which is rather small to try to make up by selling $20 drinks and Beatles trinkets in the lobby.

Why does the show have so many great reviews on Yelp? All I can guess is that Cirque du Soleil has great public relations spin doctors. Skip this show and go see one of the other amazing Cirque du Soleil performances on the strip.  My current favorite is the Michael Jackson, One or Mystere."
Beatles Love,"Wow!  This is my favorite so far. Weve been to O and Ka and I think I enjoyed this one the best. We sat in section 105, which was perfect. The music is wonderful. I caught myself singing along to most of the songs. I defiantly recommend seeing Love!"
Beatles Love,"Seen Beatles LOVE twice, first time I was sober, second time I was um do I need to elaborate? I preferred the sober show. 

Ever since I was a tween I absolutely loved the Beatles, When I saw this show was in Vegas I knew I had to check it out. 

The 200 Sections are a great view for the price, Beatles love sometimes has a 50% OFF promo via online, thats the best time to grab some tickets. 

Price: Level 3 I paid $88.00 for section 203, row N Seat 1 

Oh my goodness the male contortionist with 100 abs got me all hot, Ugh just him alone is worthy of 5 stars. 

The music, Props, Dancing and Acrobatics were entertaining and kept my interest the entire time! I found myself singing along the entire time. 

This show is like a story, I can dig that, If you can appreciate music videos I think you will love this show but if your looking for acrobatics the entire show then look elsewhere.

Oh Vegas please bring me Cirque du Soleil Dark Side Of The Moon 
that would make my year!!! 
 
RANDOM FACT:
The first lyrics to Yesterday were scrambled eggs."
Beatles Love,"Just saw Love for the third time and the recent changes made it very different. Who took the Cirque out of Cirque du Soleil? This show used to be acrobats and jugglers presented very gracefully and artistically. Now its just modern dance. Its beautiful and artful, but not what Cirque used to be. I also saw Toruk recently and it was also modern dance with not much of a relationship to the old Cirque."
Beatles Love,"My boyfriend will be shocked that I only gave the show three stars (he took me to the show).  Now dont get me wrong, Every time I see a Cirque show I realize my limitations as a sub-average human being with sub-basic intelligence and creativity with a k.  The set design, creativity and talent on display in any Cirque show are always incredibly beautiful, leaving us to wonder, How the hell did they do THAT?  

The stage for this show was a basic X design, large curtains with projected images of the Beatles members tell a little story, which is sometimes followed up by the performers on stage.

Unlike a typical Cirque show which will have people floating, flying, hanging and gyrating in mid-air, this show combines the floaty elements with a lot of singing and dancing - in other words, a typical Vegas show.  Except, typically Cirque.  

For a Vegas show, Cirque certainly delivers.  But if youre looking for a more traditional Cirque du Soleil with death-defying stunts that will leave you cross-eyed, this is not the show for you.  This show is about the music and legend of the Beatles all told in a beautiful and sometimes touching way.  Even if youre not a Beatles fan youll love the story and the display.  But if youre a die-hard Cirque fan, you might feel a little disappointed."
Beatles Love,"Such a great show. I have seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas, and many of the traveling chose in other cities around the world. This one is just pure nostalgia for all of the Beatles lovers out there. They definitely hit the feeling of all of the British movement during the 60s and the Beatles theme. All of the greatest songs that you know and remember paired with a great story and song and dance. It is in your traditional Cirque du Soleil performance but more of a musical and play put together. Highly recommended for couples or families."
Beatles Love,"This cirque show is my favorite! I have seen it twice and had two different viewpoints. The upper area offers a full view of the show, while sitting up close makes you feel like youre apart of the show. The songs cirque picked are perfect. Between the acrobats, stunts, dance moves and crowd interaction......Im moved!! This show will have you falling in love with the Beatles all over again!"
Beatles Love,"Beatles fan or not, man, woman, regardless of age, I cant see anyone not giving this 5 stars.  Absolutely amazing.  Even if you hate musicals, like I do.  Its an unbelievable performance.  The talent, sets, costumes, music.  Everythings incredible.  Absolutely perfect show."
Beatles Love,"Great show &amp; experience.  Even better when its included in your trip package.  You cant beat Cirque anyday, throw in a soundtrack of all Beatles and you got gold Jerry. Gold!

Its done so well during its 5 yr run, I can only hope they do a Queen &amp; Doors version down the road."
Beatles Love,"This is my second time seeing this show. What an absolutely amazing experience. I have not had the pleasure of going to any other Cirque du Soleil shows. That said, Dr. Roberts made our night. We happened to be in the first row and he just made it extra special. The entire cast was amazing and of course you cannot go wrong with the music. 

You are able to grab a drink and snacks for the show. For me personally, I did not participate in this as I was afraid I may have to use the bathroom if I did. There are no intermissions and the show lasts about an hour and a half. 

I will absolutely go back and I am seriously considering seeing another performance done by Cirque du Soleil."
Beatles Love,"Was so excited to see my first Cirque du Soleil show. We nabbed a good deal on this show, and from the moment you walk through the rainbow colored walkway, throughout the show, and exit taking pictures with the London clad employees, youre destined to have a good time. 

Because the stage is in the center, every seat is a good seat. Thoroughly enjoyed some Beatles history, of course all the songs, and the sheer amazement of the choreography of this show.

Would highly recommend this show to others!"
Beatles Love,"Cirque d Soleil does no wrong in my book. Every show I have seen has totally blown me away. LOVE was AMAZING. I love the Beatles and combined with Cirque was 100% pure amazing in my book. 

I really enjoyed how they captured each Beatles song with dancing, lights and acrobatics. We sat in the 300s and had a great view on everything. The best part of all of the Cirque shows is that no matter where you sit you are insured a great view. The set design and sound is amazing. We got a steal of a deal on Travelzoo.com. Tickets were sort of pricey before the discount, but I would have paid for them even if I wouldnt have had the discounted tickets. 

I dont want to give away any spoilers but just be prepared to amaze all of your senses. I agree that even if you arent a huge Beatles fan you would still enjoy this show."
Beatles Love,"Very cool. I didnt know what to expect from this show, but it was very good. Exciting, Entertaining, thrilling.. definitely one of the best Cirque shows.

Try to get a set in the front, right by the stage, this show is very interactive and it is even more exciting if youre down in the action. (Although, theres not a bad seat in the whole place)."
Beatles Love,Incredible show at the Mirage for Beatles Fans. The theatre is set up in a way that every seat has an amazing view for the entire show. It never got boring - not for a moment. They transition from song to song and act to act seamlessly. Fantastic and enjoyable experience - would love to see again
Beatles Love,"So before the end of year, I have to write about the coolest thing I did this year. And that was seeing The Beatles LOVE in Las Vegas. 

I had only seen one Cirque show before, which was Totem. Totem is a traveling show, which had already amazed me with its quality of performance. I was expecting around the same for this show, but it completely blew my expectations out of the water.

We chose The Beatles LOVE because it was in a reasonable price range and seemed the most entertaining. I had grown up listening to The Beatles (I grew up in Berkeley). My boyfriend wasnt as excited about it since he didnt but he enjoyed it a lot anyways.

Everything from the beginning to the end was just amazing. Even the opening scene had captured me. It was mind-blowingly beautiful. Everything about it was just pure art... The music, the dancing, the aerial tricks, the theater, the special effects. The funny thing is, when you hear the lyrics to some Beatles songs now such as I want to be in an octopuss garden in the shade, you think in your head what were they thinking??.... And from watching this show, you can almost understand what was going through their head as they were writing these songs.

I love the stylistic art in this show. It really captured the whole peace, love, and psychedelic movement of the Beatles. It has something for everyone. It is wholly entertaining on the outer surface, and yet there seems to be some deep meaning behind it. If you pay attention to the reoccurring themes and symbolism, there is a whole different story playing out aside from all the tricks and stunts that are going on.

My only regret is that we didnt get better seats. We were in section 304, and the best seats in the house are the 200s, not the 100s. There is so much stuff going on and they utilize the entire stage. The sound is outstanding since the speakers are built into the seats. I was really blown away by how much the special effects make a difference. The visuals and the sound were just amazing in creating the perfect psychedelic experience.

I would highly recommend this show to anyone, Beatles fan or not."
Beatles Love,"Wow!  I dont know how you could not give these performers 5-stars.  I mean, seriously, what an amazing experience and production!  It was the only show I saw in Vegas, but it was by far the best show Ive seen in a long time, and that includes NYC productions.  You gotta get some Beatles Love when youre in LV.  

I tried to get discounted tickets, but that didnt work out, so were staying at the Mirage and head back there to check on availability on a Sunday night.  Shows remaining = 7:00p and 9:30p.  We opted for the 9:30p show so we could catch dinner beforehand.  Much to our surprise they had tickets available.  

The guy at the Mirage ticket counter was really cool, he talked about the seat offerings and mentioned how the back seats were not that far from the stage and youre higher up and can see everything as opposed to the front seats which are set lower than the stage.  You can pick what you want, but we were pretty happy w/ our seats in the back row.  Another bonus - - he even offered us a 20% discount...that rocked.  He said they were 98% sold out, when we got in there we saw several rows of open seating, so lessons learned - - everythings negotiable, it doesnt hurt to ask, you may get your wish.  

The show was spectacular to say the least.  If youre a Beatles fan then you have to go, if youre not then youll become one regardless.  As for the show itself, its like a combination of Harry Potter, Technocolor Coat, Willy Wonka, Stomp, and Tim Burton.  Theres singing, plenty of different styles of dancing, a little acrobatics, rollerblading, and lots of props and fun.  The dancing is eloquent and graceful.  They match it all w/ the various Beatles hits and also play some vintage film at the end of the show.  

It was one of the highlights of my trip to Vegas, this show was spectacular and I would definitely go back again and again and again.  This show and the cast ROCK!"
Beatles Love,"Yep. LOVE is still my favorite Cirque show.

Its been 2.5 years since I saw it twice in the same week. I was afraid it might have lost a little something since then. I mean, I used to listen to the soundtrack daily in my car and may have worn myself out on it. But moments into the performance, those fears were allayed. The heart and soul of LOVE is the wonderful soundscape that George and Giles Martin have crafted. That part is evidently timeless and it still translates magically to the stage.

This time around, I managed to get front row seats. To be honest, I think I prefer to watch the show from higher up. Its not that being so close is a bad thing; its just different. In the front row, your eye level is just above the stage. The show is a trip to begin with, but looking up and being so close to the performers exacerbates that feeling. At the same time, you probably miss a lot of things with your view occasionally obstructed. But with so much going on, this is true no matter where you sit. The important thing for me is that my friend absolutely loved it. Outside of my Dad, shes the biggest Beatles fan I know and it was just ridiculous that she had never seen the show.

By the end, I found myself falling in love with LOVE again. In fact, Im listening to the soundtrack again as I type this review."
Beatles Love,"No one likes change, especially when something that isnt broken should be fixed, BUT once you get used to them, the updates on the show really help bring the emotions, meaning, and creativity of the music to life even more than before. There is still a good balance of acrobatics, dancing, and plenty of more oohs and aahs that transport you to a dream-like state."
Beatles Love,"Worst. Show. Ever.

Maybe if you drop acid before the performance its awesome. But I found that other than the opening scene, the acts were either way too busy or slow and boring. And I cant tell you why they named it Love.  

This show isnt worth your time."
Beatles Love,"Words cannot describe. AMAZING! Best Cirque show I have EVER seen. Highly recommend!

We had just had our nuptials and to celebrate, I chose this show. (Pats self on back). We were sporting our wedding attire. The crowd greeted us with congratulations and asked us to kiss--we did. 

My husband had never been to a Cirque show prior. Hands down it was the BEST show he has ever seen. (Yay for me and my choice--in both my husband and this show) His favorite band is the Beatles so it was a total win-win.

There is NO bad seat in the house. We did not go cheap on tickets nor did we go all out. We had a great view of everything. My mouth was open the entire time in awe (he sang every song out loud).

If you are thinking of taking in one Cirque show...see Love. You will have a wonderful time!

1,000 Halley puppies dance in unison!"
Beatles Love,"Yes yelpers, this show was A-OK. Not due to the fact that I was pretty much buzzed and in food coma watching it but it wasnt all that great.

The show was total roller coaster. It started great, then slowed down to a sleeper moment (literally, thy bf and I both fell asleep) then back to us all drawn in. It wasnt consistent as well. It was a very busy show with multiple acts on stage entertaining at once. There were only a few handful solo parts.

Glad our tickets were comped otherwise Id be very unhappy trying to win back my money through slots or black jack =P"
Beatles Love,"Great music. Cirque du soleil quality entertainment. Talented artists. Awesome venue with not a bad seat in the house. Live, historical recordings of The Beatles jamming and playing around back in the days. I was mesmerized the entire time. Worth the cost of the ticket at about $100 a seat."
Beatles Love,"This show is amazing!! I have never been to a show in Vegas and I am glad this was the first one that I get to see!! Sadly, no video or photo taking allowed but the experience itself will always be in my memories. It was a 360 stage so no matter where you sat you would see the stage but the seats that I sat were awesome! I liked how the audience gets to play a part on some of the experience. The song choices were great and I knew majority of it and I like how each song plays into the whole story line. Overall, great show to see when in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"Our first Cirque du Soleil show.  Great fun with lots of (loud) Beatles hits, some of which were remixed to make a little more contemporary.  Never a lull in the 90 minute intermission-free show, either visually or sonically.  The acrobatics werent spectacular, but the show is more about mood (happy), music and dance, which were all good.  Dont sit too low or youll miss things.  We sat in the premium view section, about halfway up, and had a great view."
Beatles Love,"With this being my 3rd Cirque show under my belt I can safely say that maybe now I can start reviewing these things and certainly this is my first non-food review, but theres a first thing for everything right?

Bottom line is that based on the stage and performance area there really isnt what one would consider a bad seat anywhere to be honest..I was in the lower level towards one of the entrance sections so that was definitely pretty nifty to get an added take on things!

Love certainly seemed to be one of the more complete themed story lines compared to the ones Ive seen previously..On top of that even picking up the tickets was pretty seamless..We went a few hours before the show and got in/out effortlessly which is always a plus! 

My highlight was seeing this young man (probably around 9-12 years old?) just ripping up the stage..He saw me point to him and admire his popping and other earth shattering moves and when he went to leave the stage at the end reached out for a high five..I guess little things like that go a long way in their minds, but honestly each member left their heart on the stage that night!

All in all, definitely make this one of your stops for a great evening of Vegas entertainment Cirque style!"
Beatles Love,"Huge Beatles fan here so maybe it was the years of built up anticipation of combining the awe of Cirque with the greatest group of all time that lead to a 3-star rating. 

The yelpers who said the show lacked the wow factor hit it right on the head. 90% of the show seemed like the level of choreography a high school could put on with a heightened costume budget.  

After seeing 5 other cirque shows, this one let me down. I noticed a lot of the 5 star reviews came from people who had yet to see a cirque show and this was their first."
Beatles Love,"So Im a pretty big Beatles fan....that being said, this show was zzzzz snore fest.  It felt like a ballet meets the Russian Sochi opening games.  Kinda cool. Music was good but your thinking what the hell am I watching?  Whats with the bald guy blowing smoke on people?  Didnt know stomp had anything to do with the Beatles... The music was great.  The venue fantastic. The show.... mediocre. 

Go to this show only if its free. Otherwise go see something else. Like Absinthe or O."
Beatles Love,"Ive been to the Beattles Love show. To be honest, Im not a huge fan. The first time I saw the show, I fell asleep. It might have been because I was super tired or it might have been because its just not my cup of tea. I am not a fan of the Beattles music. The second time I watched the show, I did not fall asleep, but I did not enjoy it. It is a cirque du soleil show so there are many cool aspects t the show. They do have the usual acrobats. There were acts that were impressive, but if you dont really like the background music, then you wont really enjoy the show. 

The show did a great job with relating the Beattles music with the different events going on in the world during that time period. They do have huge projectors. The best place to view them in my opinion is going to be section 209 or section 200."
Beatles Love,"Tonight 16 Oct. 2014 was the second time that Ive seen the Beatles LOVE show at the Mirage Casino in Las Vegas. This show is definitely worth seeing. The dancers, the aerial artists the music all come together in one flowing magical evening. If you get to see one show in Las Vegas I would highly recommend this one there are two shows every night except Tuesday and Wednesday.
Tickets range from $79 up to about 175. I think sitting higher is more advantageous as you get to see things take shape. However tonight we sat nine rows from the stage and that was very good as well."
Beatles Love,"First off, what a incredible show. The venue is in the Mirage Hotel, a fantastic location with plenty of choices for your pre-show meal. The show has a gift shop with anything that you could think of regarding the Beatles, as well as some other items that might surprise you. There are no bad seats in the house as the stage is in the round, and it is somewhat customer interactive. Not only do you get a fantastic catalog of Beatles music, you also get an amazing acrobatic act in full Cirque fashion. The show lasts a full 90 minutes and it will seem to fly by leaving you wishing there was more. The interpretation of the music seems spot on, with a musical investigation of each emotion transitioning each Beatles hit to the next. Bottom line, this show is a must see for both the hard core Beatles fan as well as someone looking to expand their horizons, DONT MISS THIS!!!!"
Beatles Love,Finally got to see this show. The music was good. The performers were good. They get the crowd involved. But if I had choice to see the Beetles or Michael Jackson show I would MJ!!!
Beatles Love,"This show deserves 5 stars, and I dont dish those out easily!

We saw 4 shows while in Vegas, including Michael Jackson One by Cirque du soleil.  You must know that I am a Michael Jackson fan, and not really a Beatles fan.  I gave MJ ONe 4 stars, but this show, DESERVES 5 stars!

Its hard to know where to start, but the show brought back child-like wonder...You know that feeling you got as a child seeing the circus for the first time?  Thats how it felt like.  It was magical, exciting, creative, unique, exhilarating...it really did not disappoint!  The performers were very talented, the costumes and sets looked awesome, and the stage was the most innovative I ever saw.  It kept changing shapes, raising and lowering as needed, incredible! 

The music of the Beatles was very well interpreted by the Cirque, I truly tip my hat off to them and highly recommend this show!"
Beatles Love,"Fantastic show! Ive been to it a couple of times and enjoyed it both times. Id say probably sit about 1/2 way up as you get a better view of everything than sitting close but lower down. Love the music, love the performers, LOVE!"
Beatles Love,"What can I say? Absolutely breathtaking! The show was very entertaining! The acrobatics were out of this world!! The stagecraft was mind-blowing, the acting was superb! The whole thing was impeccable! So amazed with these people! I am honored to have experienced their talent!!!!"
Beatles Love,"I dont go to shows very often so I didnt really know what to expect and wasnt so impatient either. But this show literally blew my mind away. Ive been a huge fan of the Beatles since my early teenage years and the show reminded me of how much I love their music and their story. Even though many of the songs featured were their latest work, and I tend to prefer their earlier albums, the show brought out another dimension to the music that made me appreciate it more, see it in a more vibrant and colorful light. It told a multitude of mystical stories. I particularly loved the rendition of For the benefit of Mr. Kite - magically quirky and so much more kookily demented than I had ever pictured in my head, and of Help (one of my favorite songs ever) with the four skaters - absolutely unbelievable and crazily moving. I also loved how they used live audio and video footage from the Beatles themselves in addition to the ethereally superbe special effects.

The acrobats and dancers were incredibly skilled and the scenography of utter and unique beauty. I cant even begin to imagine how much work, effort, creativity and dedication went into bringing this show to life - just wow. 

In my eyes it was a true homage to The Beatles as a group, to John, Paul, George and Ringo not only as artists but as individuals, and to performance arts in general. I warmly recommend this show to any kind of audience - whichever fan club you belong to, it will deeply stir you and you will come out feeling more alive."
Beatles Love,"LOVE is a high energy and beautiful performance. It remains one of my favorite Vegas shows. However, if you are a Cirque du Soleil fans expecting something like O, Ka or Mystere, you might be disappointed. The focus of LOVE is Beatles songs. The circus acts are there to accompany the music without distracting the audiences. The use of visual effects are excellent in this show but the acrobat acts are probably not the best Cirque du Soleil could offer.

Love is one of the few shows where there are practically no bad seats. The stage is a relatively small 360 degree theatre. Even if you sit far back you can still have an amazing experience. If you are Beatles fan this is one truly mesmerizing show not to be missed."
Beatles Love,"Im a huge Beatles fan and a pretty big Cirque du Soleil fan having seen Mystere, O, and Ka live in Vegas. This production leaves a lot to be desired.

There are two extremes of circus/acrobat-like shows. One extreme is many of the Chinese and Russian circus/acrobatic shows - all human acrobatics, zero art. Love is pretty much the other extreme - almost all art and almost no acrobatics.

Cirque du Soleils trademark is more balanced show with impressive human acrobatics (using many Chinese and Russian acrobats, not surprisingly) matched with compelling original art &amp; music. Love deviates from that blend into the WTF is up with these random people in haphazard, colorful costumes dancing to slightly remixed Beatles music? Where are the people doing *amazing* things in an *artistic* way?

Ka is the best Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. Absinthe is probably the best show overall in Vegas, and I have seen more than ten of them.

---
Update:

I had rated Love two stars for this but changed it to one after two recent events:

1) Saw credit card bill and was reminded that I paid about $150 per person. Absinthe is about 1/2 that and is *infinitely* better.

2) Watched Cirque du Soleils Verakai in 720p HD, which is very good, and am further reminded of how much Love sucked and is completely outside of Cirque du Soleils MO."
Beatles Love,"And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.

~ Lennon/McCartney

Of the three Cirque du Soleil extravaganzas I saw in as many days in Vegas last week, The Beatles: Love was the one that moved me the most.  This was unexpected, because -- although I am very, very familiar with the Beatles music -- I am not an ardent fan. This production cost over $125 million to stage, and every penny was visible on stage -- and audible, with six hand-tuned speakers in every seat-back.  Fantastic choreography, dazzling costumes, incredible sets, and of course, the amazing and thrilling acts that distinguish Cirque du Soleil from any other company performing today. Highly recommended."
Beatles Love,"I had a bit of trepidation while researching this show because the general trend seemed to be that people who enjoy other Cirque shows (we do) were less impressed with this one, while people who dont care for other Cirque shows tend to prefer it because its different from the rest.  And to some extent, it is different from the rest as there are few mind-defying acrobatic acts or incredible contortionists, or other staples of a traditional Cirque du Soleil show.  What there is, however, is great Beatles music, incredibly talented dancers, and a rocking good time.  This is the show to see if you want to walk out with a big grin on your face and while we got free tickets, it would have easily been worth paying full price (there are often discounted tickets available though, so look around first).

The theater is circular and very intimate, so I dont think theres a bad seat in the house.  The sound system is extremely good, and they use the space well.  The show is well-paced, with only one or two numbers that drag and could be revised or eliminated, but it doesnt detract from the overall experience.  Of course, Beatles fans will love the music and cultural references, but even non-Beatles fans will appreciate the dancing and entertainment value.  Its also a great show for kids as there is a lot to look at and the mood is festive and fun.  We are planning a return visit on our next trip."
Beatles Love,"LOVED IT. Great show for people of all ages. Theres a great mixture of humor and seriousness that I think everyone can appreciate. They even include audience participation. 

This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and I cant wait to see my next one. If youre worried about price, even the cheaper top row seats are fantastic. You wont regret seeing this show."
Beatles Love,"You really have to LOVE the Beatles because the show is not worth your money.

-Barely any acrobatics 
-Lackluster dancing 

2 stars for great music but that is to be expected."
Beatles Love,"Out of all the Cirque shows in Vegas, THIS is the best one to see! Im a local &amp; Ive seen in 3 times. There is not a bad seat in the house. There is a point in the show where the lower half of the audience is covered for about a minute. Whether you are or are not a Beatles fan you will love this show! This show has so much I cant name it all, but you will love it all!

If youre a local dont forget to mention it when you go to the box office to get a discount. Right now they are doing a special on 11/18 at a special pricing!"
Beatles Love,"This is not just another Beatles cover band act;  fans of the Beatles and/or Cirque du Soleil would not be disappointed in seeing this performance at the Mirage...

All of the floating, flying, jumping, trampolining, trapezing, rollerblading is so dynamic and nonstop that I found it hard to focus on any one part.  The performers are all in such top gymnast shape, the strength, the balance, the flexibility, it just puts all of my own yoga exercise efforts in modest perspective...

I have come to distinguish Cirque du Soleil from any ordinary circus act by the music and sound for which they have always been known for the great job that they do and this is no exception.  The venue has speakers built into the seating and the songs that we all recognize have been remixed and sounds just incredible...

But this is not just a collection of remixed Beatles songs choreographed with The Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, there were passages where you felt that the actual Beatles were there as some of their studio dialogs were also brought in with their silhouettes to give the performance some life and make it feel as if they were actually there...

Give us back John and George, and you can have Justin Bieber (hahah!)...

We loved the show, took the whole family.  Try using tix4tonight service for discounts..."
Beatles Love,What a great experience! Visually a very stunning and fantastic show! I love the quirkiness and the unique-ness of the show.  I loved the costumes and the performers were all great- very full of personality and fun.  Overall this is a great show! And of course you will absolutely love the music and the atmosphere.
Beatles Love,"First off, I asked for aisle seats live and in person at the box office. When we arrived, we found that we were indeed at the end of a row, but not an aisle.  We had to climb over 12 people to get to our seats, which made it very uncomfortable when we walked out in the middle of the performance.... very boring.

Every seat in this theater-in-the-round has partially obstructed views

Do not get me wrong, the acrobats are very talented and I am a big fan of Mystere, O and KA, but even the failed Elvis show was better than this.

Do not waste your money!"
Beatles Love,"This show is pure magic! If you are a Beatles fan, this is a MUST see. I saw it several years ago and went back this weekend to see it again and was surprised to find out that they have revamped it. I didnt think it could get better than the first time I saw it but it truly was. Jaw dropping acrobatics, props, actors, visuals, and of course the music. OMG.  They way they have combined some of the songs and the transitions is just brilliant. I cannot recommend this show enough and even my 5 year old loved it and was engrossed. Best. Show. Ever!"
Beatles Love,"Definitely one of the best experiences of my life. I would go to this show again and again.
I am a Beatles fan and I was mesmerized.
I had seen Ka before this and knew that Cirque was capable of greatness, but with Love, they just took things to a new level.
Hats off!"
Beatles Love,"Ive been to Vegas more times than I can count, but I had still never seen a Vegas show. Probably because I was too cheap. But I was determined to see one this time, but I had to make it a good one. After reading tons of reviews, I decided this was the Cirque show to see. I didnt walk in as a huge Beatles fan, but I think I might be one now! 

The show was incredible. After the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. It was so polished and beautiful. The music had a nice flow and was mixed very well. Also, the pacing was excellent. I had heard that O had dull parts, which I wanted to avoid. This one had very few breaks in the action. There were so many things to watch that I couldnt possibly see everything. I chose C section seats as some of the reviews suggested, and they were a perfect view of the action. To be clear, this wasnt about a major storyline. There were some interesting recurring characters. But to me, it had themes of unrequited love, fighting against unjust authority, celebrating individuality, and embracing and loving your fellow man.

Now I want to go back to this show every time Im in Vegas. I cant really think of a higher compliment."
Beatles Love,"Ive gone to several Cirque de Soleil shows, and at every single one of em at one point within the show I fell asleep. 

This is the only exception to that rule.  Granted as a disclaimer, Im not much of a show nor theater type.

This show was engaging and had the right pacing, so didnt have any boring lulls.  Id recommend this to people who generally dont like shows, as well as to people who enjoy shows in Vegas. It appears theres also not a bad seat in the house, but the price differential for the more expensive seats to the cheaper ones is minimal enough where you could treat yourself to a guaranteed closer and unobstructed view."
Beatles Love,"I am so glad that we left LOVE as our last big show. I wish I could have been there on stage, dancing my heart and soul out and twirling while soaring higher than the crowd. Its a very inspirational, and moving show. I cried twice! The dancers are just spectacular and the entire production was through the roof! I will most definitely be returning year after year, and maybe one day strive to be a part of the cast. Hmm... Anything can happen right?! COMECOMECOME!!!"
Beatles Love,"Best show Ive ever seen. This is the second time Ive seen this show and I loved it each time. If you are a lover of all things Beatles, this is a must see.  The music, arrangement, colors, dancers, acrobatics was all so amazing. The guy next to me was in tears."
Beatles Love,"are you a beatles fan? what about a cirque du soleil fan? if you answer no... well, are you a fan of good music and wanna watch a show that would make you go ohhh and ahhh.

i would definitely recommend this show! go to the tix4tonight box office and get your discounted tickets right now! i got tickets for the second row for a discounted price. how can i possibly complain. 

seats are tight meaning not very much leg room. but really for this show anywhere you sit youll be able to see everything. the music is loud enough for you to hear whats going on. no pictures can be taken. they take that seriously as well. 

i had a bad experience because i had two very annoying girls in front of me who were inconsiderate of other people who were behind them. they were jumping off of their seats, playing air drums that were off beat, talking throughout the show, and well ill stop there. but lets just hope that your experience would be better than mines. cause they took all of my attention! even after the staff asked them to not be as rowdy they still were talking and kept looking back. 

anyways, theres a short intermission. they play all of the hits! the concept of each song was really good! at the end it reminded me a little of blues man group. i dont want to tell you too much due to it being a spoiler. 

overall, this was one of my top 5 cirque show!"
Beatles Love,"This show had many more slow moments and group dance numbers than previous Cirque du Soleil shows we have been to, and also focused a little more on the psychedelic aspects than I expected. It actually felt a bit repetitious with the group dance numbers and aerial ropes dancing. I feel like these shows typically have more variety in the types of acts, but each of these occurred at least 3 times in the show as the primary focal point.

There were three great unusual and/or fast paced acts, though - a skaters ramp, trampoline act, and a giant sheet that enveloped the audience for Yellow Submarine.

For seating, my advice is to sit at least halfway up to have a better panorama of the stage since they perform in the middle of the audience, and you will then not have to crane your neck upwards as much to see the performers."
Beatles Love,"I have seen the old version of this show twice and it was much much better before.  It seemed to me like they were making a current political statement and I didnt like it as much.  With the exclusion of some numbers like I am a Walrus, the show feels disjointed and doesnt take you away like the old one used to.  Dont get me wrong, its still a good show, the performers are great and the music is amazing.  But it used to be magical and isnt anymore.  And guess what, tons of empty seats  on a Saturday night so clearly others feel the same way.  Shame they had to change it."
Beatles Love,"This is my second Cirque show and I absolutely loved every minute of it!  I had great seats in section 206, row K. They were the front row seats in that section. There was so much to see and so much going on and I had perfect seats to take it all in. I really think at this show any seat would be a great seat even if you were in the furthest row back. Great music and great dancing. Definitely worth seeing!"
Beatles Love,"This is the first Cirque du Soleil show that Ive ever seen so take this with a grain of salt. Overall I loved Love! The music is fantastic, the acrobatics was amazing, the choreography is tight and flawless, sound was incredible, and the visual effects were gorgeous. There is no bad seat as the stage is round so dont over-think about where you are going to sit.

If you like/love the Beatles and Cirque du Soleil, you should see this show. I enjoyed this show so much that Id love to watch the other Cirque shows. I finally get why people love Cirque so much."
Beatles Love,Great show!:) I love beatles and I was so excited throughout the show since I could listen to beatles songs while watching the amazing performance done by the performers. The theatre is round shaped and anywhere you seat would be a good seat so you dont need to buy a front row seat. I loved all the dancing going on:)
Beatles Love,"More a dance show than other Cirque shows. Its
 pretty amazing. As always, you sat there with your mouth open taking it in. Ive seen most of the shows and this one is up there. The costumes,sets and script are all pretty terrific. And then there is the Beatles Music!"
Beatles Love,"Really, I would give this show a 3.5 out of 5, instead of just 3.  Its good, not great, but good.  

For what we paid, we were just expecting a bit more of a lively show, with a lot more Beatles songs to sing along with. They played a handful, maybe 4 Beatles songs you could really sing along with.  They played of the slower psychedelic songs during the Cirque.  Its really a circus-opera set in a round auditorium.  The acrobats are quite talented but the show seemed to droll on at several points.  We found ourselves yawning several times. 

Glad we saw it, we can check Cirque du Soleil off of the list of things to see in Vegas.  I would not go see it again though.  

We would have had a lot more fun seeing Human Nature again. They have the best show in Vegas period, in my opinion."
Beatles Love,"Ive attended two other Cirque shows....La Nouba and O.  This show (The Beatles) was just...underwhelming.  Sorry, I wasnt impressed.  As a matter of fact, I actually fell asleep at one point.  It was the biggest waste of money during my entire Vegas trip.

If youre a huge, huge, huge Beatles fan, this show might be for you.  I like the Beatles.  But when I attend a Cirque show, I expect to have a unique circus experience with some thrilling acrobats to boot.  The Beatles Love was a dance party.  They played Beatles music and danced.  I chose this show because of all of the great reviews on the site.  Im not knocking anyone for liking this show - to each his/her own.  I just wished that I had paid more attention to those who didnt like it so much.

I gave it an extra star because I like Beatles music.  

Blah."
Beatles Love,"This show was absolutely amazing! I totally get why they dont want anyone to take pictures or video during it because I think just going in there and experiencing it yourself is the only way to do it. Ive always been a fan of the Beatles, and this was the show I picked for my birthday. And the show didnt disappoint. The music was arranged wonderfully, and the costumes and the acrobats and just everything was amazing. At times I almost felt overwhelmed because there were so many people to watch and things to look at, but it was overwhelming in a good way. There was just so many cool things to see that I was trying to take in as much of it as I could.

We also got the tickets for about half price because we actually went to the box office the night before to ask if they still had seats available for tomorrow night. (It was a Sunday when we went to check and some timeshare people had told us the show was sold out.) As it turned out, they were doing two shows on Monday night and the guy at the box office told us there were more seats available for the 9:30. So we asked him to pull that up, and he told us he would give us a deal. We ended up getting seats that were kind of in the middle (not in the balcony but not right next to the stage either) for like $90 a piece. We were sold, and again the show was amazing! It was our first Cirque du Soleil show, and we enjoyed it immensely."
Beatles Love,"Agh! I did not have the best seats for this show. I was behind a pillar and learned the hard way that obstructed view REALLY means obstructed. I suggest you do it right and plan early so you can catch more than glimpses of this fun show.
I hope you like the Beatles, because this show is all Beatles, all the time and I LOVED IT! The soundtrack is amazing and the performers and props were beautiful and just perfect. More than once did the show have that Ahhhhh! factor. I cant wait to return and see this show the proper way (without Pillars). Its definitely worth the money and your precious Vegas time. It will make your trip for sure!"
Beatles Love,"Enjoyed the show.....took my Dad and the acrobats were amazing! Like the stadium seating, which gave a great view of the 360 stage from any angle."
Beatles Love,"Another Cirque masterpiece!

Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Check Out This Show:
1) Not exactly a Beatles fan?  Neither WAS I.  Now I am.  
2) The lighting is absurdly good... otherworldly.  
3) Probably the most colorful production I have ever seen, and I am a jaded New Yorker who has been fortunate enough to see tons of Broadway shows. 
4) The music almost feels like it was made for this production!
5) Four words: flying bed on cloud.  Pure magic.  
6) You could see this show tens of times and always find something new to watch. 
7) This production is massive and lavish!  It is really hard to believe.  
8) The athleticism is crazy good.  
9) The costumes and sets are crazy good. 
10) Not just a celebration of the Beatles, but a celebration of life. Prepare to maybe even get a bit choked up."
Beatles Love,"Like the show since I like Beatles. I have seen couple of CDS shows, this is my 7th show so far. Compare to other CDS show, there is not much extraordinary acrobatics, its more dancing show. Suggested to pick higher seats since on one of the section they will pull big white sheet, and it covered our head so we cannot see anything."
Beatles Love,"Not sure why this show got such rave reviews. I was lucky enough to get a 2 for 1 deal, so I got tickets to see this highly recommended show. Ive seen other Cirque shows which did not disappoint- Ovo, Iris, and Totem. Maybe I went to the show with high expectations, but Love definitely did not meet my standards. I didnt understand the story, there were not circus-like acts, too much contemporary dancing, and I dozed off here and there. I enjoyed the music, but not the acts. One thing I do remember about the show were the cool lights. I dont recommend paying full price for this show."
Beatles Love,Amazing! Wish I could see all the Cirque shows. If you love the Beatles you will love this.
Beatles Love,"All you need is LOVE, LOVE is all you need...I LOVED LOVE. LOVE Cirque Du Soleil and The Beatles. Nuff said?"
Beatles Love,"I am a big Beatles fan and this is the first Cirque show I have ever been to and I was enthralled from start to finish. 
There was a TON going on non-stop and such high energy and beautiful music. Lighting effects gave a tone that could change the feel in the room and the stage constantly morphed. It was a bit slow starting out but by the end, I didnt want the show to stop. I could not imagine if someone saw this on some psychedelics, it would probably be the worst or best experience of their lives.
Most of the Beatles hits were represented and a few semi-deep cuts. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was my favorite because they dropped a lot of LED lines throughout and they synced on some parts and were just made to look like stars other times. 
I could not recommend this more."
Beatles Love,"What a treat. First of all, let me preface by say that I am not a huge Beatles  fan and was a little reluctant to even go. This said....I AM SO happy that I went. If you can, go on an off night too...not Friday or Saturday. We went on a Sunday, and were upgraded to floor seats at no additional charge. 

Wonderful story of their songs and incredible acrobatics and dancing.

We also splurged on a speciality cocktail IN a huge Beatles LOVE cup. worth the $$.

Lovely evening. I highly recommend it."
Beatles Love,"Always been a fan of the Beatles music, seen the show twice, and still love it, service was above and beyond, nguyet was very attentive, warm and professional, one of the best shows in Vegas dont miss."
Beatles Love,"A show involving the BEATLES was a must see for me!! A friend of mine a while back recommended this show. I got last minute tickets for this show since it was New Years day and not a lot of shows were available. I had wanted to check this show out and decided to see it. I got a good deal even though tickets did go fast for this show. The entrance is fantastic to see and it makes you feel like you are entering England during the BEATLES era. The people who worked there were in costume and the stage was beautiful. The show was breathtaking, the music they used to create their scenes were phenomenal. Its a feast for the ears and the eyes. The performers were sensational and this show left me wanting more and more. You may have to see it several times to take in the different scenes and small details you may have missed at first. 

Get there early before the show, so if you decide to get snacks and drinks for the show you get them in due time. The lines can get long at the snack place and you may have to wait a while. If you love the BEATLES or you are a Cirque fan this is a good show to watch. Also, for people who have watched the show if you have not already, check out the BEATLES ROCK BAND Game as well :-)"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen this show and the Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil, and neither one disappointed!  I would see both of them over and over again.  Now, I will give the edge to this show, because I like The Beatles music much more than MJs.  The performances are unbelievably spectacular and even if youre not the biggest Beatles fan, you should enjoy the show!  Im ready to go see it again... and again!"
Beatles Love,"My daughter and I attended the 7 pm show on 5/12/16, and were totally transported from beginning to end. The music is from the original recordings so it is easy to sing along. My daughter is 24 and is a Beatles fan. It was less acrobatic than many Cirque shows, but the theatrical displays and performances were joyous and mesmerizing. I was discouraged that the audience wasnt more engaged, but as we left the theater, most couldnt resist singing along to All You Need is Love. It was a fantastic experience!"
Beatles Love,"Ive been here twice now.   Loved it each and every time and you had better see it if you are in Vegas.
There, thats all I have to say about it. I dont want to ruin the show for you by telling you more details."
Beatles Love,"This show totally sucked.   If youre a dude, youre not going to like this show.


There wasnt a ton of acrobatics, but it had more dancing.  This was like a bad musical, except the characters hardly sing.  Rather they rely of course on the soundtrack of the Beatles and the characters running around trying to act out a story.

And .. as for the story.. does the guy lose the girl, and then see her pursued and wooed by another dude before she gets killed in an accident and go to heaven?  Or did I drink my giant $16-20 Pina Colada too quickly?  Its not a really happy story.

Thank goodness the pina colada was significantly large enough to last the show.  (Might hold ~40 ounces.)


The true mark of a good show is the buzz that you hear when you walk out, with everyone raving how great or awesome it was.  When I went to pick up my tickets at will-call for the late show, the previous show was coming out.. and that should have been my cue to request a refund before I even go it.  I understand their disappointment now.  Save your money for dinner, gambling, or something other than Beatles/Love show.


My recommendation:  Go see the Cirque du Soleil O show.  That was fantastic when I saw that on a previous trip.  Thats one of the most popular shows for good reason.

I think they even have a more sensual (read: revealing outfits :-) show if thats your thing.   But there are other much better venues if you want to see skin."
Beatles Love,"I guess Im not really a Beatles fan, so it was difficult for me to fully appreciate their show.  Dont get me wrong, I like their songs (at least the popular ones I know from watching Glee, haha) but since the theme of this show seemed to be their journey as a band, it was difficult for me to understand.

I dont know much history about the Beatles, so I didnt really know what was going on during the little numbers that were performed throughout the show, but it apparently is supposed to reflect on their journey together as a band, all of which was completely foreign to me.  I think I was expecting more of a general storyline like the Ka performance I saw earlier in the weekend, rather than individual skits to songs that didnt seem to connect cohesively together as a story.

The numbers were mostly dancing numbers with minimal aerial tricks.  I wasnt wowed by the performance as I was at Ka Cirque du Soleil performance.

The cool thing about this show was the stage.  Chairs completely surrounded 360 degrees of the stage in a tiered fashion so that every seat was a good seat.  Me and my BF were able to acquire seats that were closer (aka lower) to the stage, yet not too close (low) where you have to look up to see the performance.

Bottom line: Probably something youd want to see as a Beatles fan, but if youre looking to see more aerial tricks, Id suggest seeing something else."
Beatles Love,Absolute best show I have seen. Im from New York and have seen countless shows but Love by far blows them all away. Would highly recommend!
Beatles Love,"If you love the beatles, you will love this show. End of story. Its not the same as other cirque shows, but it couldnt be. The more you know about the beatles, the more you will enjoy this show. Im not going into detail, as I dont want to give things away. There are a lot of cirque elements, you just have to look for thrm. There are things happening everywhere and I suggest sitting farther from the stage to catch it all. The people up close seemed to be missing a lot, and they paid far more than I did to see this show. 

So, all in all, sit midway to the back to enjoy the ENTIRE show!"
Beatles Love,Omg this show is incredible... Amazing choreography music and all around fun... Then i got a backstage tour what an amazing night...
Beatles Love,"Every time Im in Vegas (at least twice a year) I make sure to see Love. Its not as acrobatic or breathtaking as some of the other Cirque shows, but what it lacks in those respects, it makes up for many times over with the music. My parents went to Vegas on the same weekend as me a few months ago and I took them to this show. My mom will openly admit shes not much of a Beatles fan, but she still had as much of a blast as my dad did. If you are even a slight Beatles fan, youll be able to sing along to every song. Definitely a show everyone needs to see at least once."
Beatles Love,"We did not have to pay for tickets and the guy that bought them got a Black Friday deal so we had some decent seats. How can you complain about a free show?

   The visuals and aerials were incredible. They left me thinking about the performance a week later. The music is from the slower songs by the Beatles. Even though I was familiar with them, my girlfriend was not.  

   There is so much happening at once that it was easy to become overwhelmed to the point I lost track of the story they were trying to tell; however the stage was specifically built for this act so I concentrated on that and was amazed by just the technical aspects.  There is a behind the scenes tour that I would love to check out."
Beatles Love,Visually stunning. If you know and love Beatles music then you will really enjoy Beatles Love. The performers are insanely talented and the tickets are worth every penny. We sat in balcony and we had a perfect view to the entire show.
Beatles Love,"I think you would have to be a huge Beatles fan to enjoy this Cirque show. Ive been to a few Cirque shows (Ka, O, Iris, Zumanity, Elvis) and The Beatles LOVE left a lot to be desired. I was hoping it would be similar to the Elvis show where the audience would learn about the life of the artists and take something away after the show. LOVE was basically the Beatles music playing over the sound system while people in decade costumes danced around. This show lacked the usual breath taking acrobatics and did not have a WOW factor. I saw a lot of eyelids in the audience as they were dreaming of a better place to be."
Beatles Love,"I was a little disappointed in Love because all Id heard were rave reviews from friends &amp; family.  Guess my expectations were a little high.  Im a huge fan of Cirque du Soleil and have seen both Mystere and O twice.  Those have been my two favorite shows.

Seems like the musical shows are sub par compared to the high bar that CDS has set for itself.  I was also underwhelmed by Elvis three years ago.  That show is now closed.  While Vegas was packed two weekends ago during the I Heart Radio festival weekend the Love theatre was only about 2/3rds full during the late show.  I purchased my tickets that morning.  

I wouldnt attend Love unless you can get discounted, or 2 for 1 tickets.  I paid $180 for 2 and if I had paid full retail I would have been pissed."
Beatles Love,"I cant believe Ive never written a review for this show. Ive seen it on four occasions over the years and each time is like seeing it for the first time. I came for preview performances before it opened years ago and was blown away. Being a great fan of the Beatles this show paid homage in the best way possible. If only Viva Elvis had been able to capture the same awe and fantastical feeling that this show seems to.

I wont rehash all the same things everyone else has said about the show, only say that if you havent gone, go. If you have seen it, go again. Its that good!"
Beatles Love,"I removed a star for the cramped seating. Really cramped and Im not that big. 
Other than that, what a show! Creative, Ingenious, Entertaining. 
Some amazing numbers kept out, but then its the Beatles and they had only 90 minutes. 
Its not my favorite Cirque show but its definitely kid friendly and the gimmicks were amazing. 
All seats are good but middle rows would be best. I was in the last row and wish i was five rows lower from the last row for the the right height. 
watch the trailer on you tube. people putting up pictures of the show should be arrested for copyright infringement and stealing from hard working artists and should be shot for it as they were explicitly told not to, and they did for pleasure which makes the theft even worse."
Beatles Love,"All you need is love, love, love is all you need...

LOVE is unlike any other Cirque show I have seen. The star is the music, not the acrobatics, and you cant help but be captivated. Each song transitions perfectly into the next and each captures a different emotion and truly draws you in closer and closer to the performance.

There isnt a bad seat in the house, dont worry about where your tickets are, just buy one and enjoy the magical world they create around you. 

There is no better place in Vegas to take a date than to LOVE, because after all, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make."
Beatles Love,"Great show.  Great entertainment. If you lived in the 60s you wont want to miss this show. It is a must see. I havent listened to the Beatles in years and what a great way to bring back the Beatles in my life. 

In all honesty, I still liked Michael Jackson One better as it was more upbeat and electric, but Love is close in entertainment value. It is very different from One as you relive the 60s and enjoy the thematic elements of that time while you sing along to Beatles songs you might have forgotten about. 

Awesome show!"
Beatles Love,"I came here during a company conference a few years ago and now Im making a review because Ill going here again this weekend.  Ill tell you what its the best show ive seen on the strip! Well the fact is that I havent seen KA, O, Blue Man Group or any other Cirque du Soleil shows in Sin City. This show will mesmerize the mind in some way and it as a fun kick to it.

When you first walk inside before ticketing, WOW the lobby corridor is GrooOOVE!!! Psychedelic! its like being in Austin Powers British world, Yeah Baby! now strike a pose and take pics! Make sure you get some of that Strawberry Fields drink at the bar before seating and keep your souvenir cup (I left mine behind the first time).

We all sat a few rows down from the top on one of those 200 sections, it was easy to see, no matter how far you are because the stage is round.

Early part of the show your gonna hear the beats thumpin rolling into the track get back it got me bobbin my head. At the start, the music is slow, and soothing and so forth. The performances are great! the Choreography is Cirque Du Soleil splendid! they all flow accordingly of some of the Beatles greatest hits.

Before all of this, I had little knowledge of Beatle Music and knowing that its my parents teenage years of their generation, was the craze!  I remember seeing some those old Beatles records my dad kept at his childhood home but it must be golden.

I recommend seeing this show, it got me to be a believer thats why Ive been wanting to take my woman this time around and thats why I played the Beatles Love CD soundtrack (provided from my company swagbag) like non-stop on our road trip back home from conference and again I played the music soundtrack non-stop on a road trip to Arizona. The music is catchy and it would make you appreciate Beatles Music more after watching this show. It even got me playing Rock Band Beatles on my XBOX 360! for crying out loud!

This is how i can describe the Beatles Love show at the Mirage: happy,joy,sad,celebrate,and all you need is love..."
Beatles Love,"My favorite show in Las Vegas so far! I am such a fan of The Beatles, and was excited to check out what the show would be like and how the music would be incorporated. I am happy with how a lot of music was somehow remixed or played throughout the show. 

The whole theater has a Liverpool ambiance, with the ushers dressed up in costumes, and every seat is a good seat, you cant go wrong where you sit! My favorite acts were Something, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds and Come Together.

The only downside, not really for me, but for others would be that there is not real story or plot line being followed, so when the show ends, youre left feeling kind of puzzled. But like I said, its not a big deal if you are a fan of the music or The Beatles themselves."
Beatles Love,"Not knowing to much about The Beatles I still enjoyed the show a lot! I knew more songs than I thought I did thats for sure! The dancers are amazing, singing and dancing also the production of the entire show from beginning to end."
Beatles Love,"I only knew 2 songs from Beatles b4 I watched this show.  I couldnt resist to move along with performers and tried to sing along when they play the songs. The show was like a fairy tale came true and I felt like in Alice in Wonderland. LOVE is so different than O and KA which there are many acrobatic acts and grand sceneries. It was like a dream, but wouldnt put you to sleep like Le Reve~ they were so energetic! I cant compare LOVE with other Cirque Du Solie shows I have seen. While I was sitting in the 2nd front row I the center, I felt like I was part of the action. I was moved and touched. Everyone has ones defination and perspective of love. So,  see it yourself and expeeience the LOVE - Beatles"
Beatles Love,"Ive never seen a show that mastered aesthetics, artistry, and entertainment in what seems to be an effortless performance. The cast of LOVE were all amazing. The visuals, whether involving the set pieces or the placement of performances, were flawless.

Our seats were situated near the stage and as a result, the experience was overwhelming. With every sense engaged (taste because I was nom-ing on popcorn the entire time), I was filled constantly with excitement and awe. 

You hear tales of the Cirque du Soleil wonders. Id like to announce that the rumors are indeed true. Cirque du Soleil and in particular, The Beatles LOVE show is perfect.

You say yes, I say no, you say stop and I say go go go... to the Beatles show."
Beatles Love,"You dont need to love The Beatles to love this show! My favorite of all the Cirques, Ive seen it 4 times &amp; will go again. Every seat in the theater is fine, so you can see this quality show for less $$ by buying the cheap seats!! This is the #1 show I recommend  to my guests &amp; friends I meet at the poker table. No ones been disappointed."
Beatles Love,This was a great show but more dancing and less acrobatics than I liked.  Its also important not to sit in the corner of an upper section like I did because the screen drops and blocks your view.
Beatles Love,"Just went to the show this past weekend - my whole family absoluletly loved it!.  The music was great, the talent was remarkable and the creativity of the whole show is over the top!!!  When 50 year olds, 21 year olds and a 19 year old all leave an event singing with a smile - expectation were met.

Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque show, and Im glad it was! My friend saw the show before and he treated me to tickets to see it for my birthday. Since he has seen it before, he knew strategically where the place place was to sit (which was a little bit higher on the balcony). 

The stage here was HUGE; it was circular, so there wasnt a bad seat in the house. The acrobatics were great, the props used were amazing and innovative. The music was awesome (duh, Beatles). I believe I kept repeating, WHAT?! throughout the whole show. Mostly because of crazy amazing things happening, and partly because of the chaos trippy-ness that was going on around me. 

I can guarantee you can see this show multiple times and see something different every time. 

Amazing! Great job, CDS!"
Beatles Love,"I saw this show a few years ago and it was not my favorite. You would have to be a real jerk to give this show a bad review so I will give it 5 stars just like all the others. 5 stars because the music is amazing and the functionality of the stage and props not to mention the performers are again amazing. I have seen La Nouba, Love, Mystere, Zumanity, Totem and O. In the Vegas area I think Zumanity is my favorite and when it comes to the traveling shows I really liked Totem ."
Beatles Love,"I love LOVE.  If youre a Beatles fan, you will adore this show.  Not as Cirque as some of the other shows, but good dancing, acrobatics, and coordination.  And the music is an interesting mix.  The theater is small so even cheap seats (which we had, in the back back back row) were great.  Go, spend what you can for seating, relax, and enjoy the show.

Also, check for tickets on your m-life account for discounts and/or stop by the tix4tonight booth as they had some when I was in town."
Beatles Love,LOVED IT! Im not a huge Beatles fan but this show was extremely entertaining!
Beatles Love,Horrible.  Dont waste your money if you did not grow up in the era.  My husband and I like a couple of Beatles songs so we wanted to try something different.  We love the Mirage and thought it would be a good show to watch.  It was horrible.  We saw Mystere 4 times and it was awesome each time.  So my expectations were set high when I watched the show.  Not only did I not like the show they stopped the show due to a medical situation in the audience (thats understandable) but they would not comp us for the hour they stopped the show.  These tickets are not cheap.  I would not recommend this show to anyone just to watch a show if you had free tickets and especially to pay the $$$ they charge.
Beatles Love,In general I am a big fan of Cirque du Soleil. Nearly every show I have seen there have been parts where I wondered on the uniqueness and talent of what I was seeing and Love is no exception to that. The theme helps bring everything together and there doesnt seem to be a bad seat in the house. In addition to being mesmerized by what is happening on the stage floor there is a part where the entire audience is under a large parachute that is really quite magical.
Beatles Love,"We really enjoyed this show!

My favorite part was being able to recognize and sing along with the songs. It wasnt as over the top as some of the other Cirque shows with regards to acrobatics, but to me it still wowd. It also doesnt seem like there is a bad seat in the entire place as the performers and stage criss cross the whole inside of the venue.

Would definitely recommend for any Beatle fan"
Beatles Love,"Whooot! This show is for fans of The Beatles and those who arent really fans alike. The stage is set up so you can see multiple things at once, and get the full force of the music. 

There is no real story line, just various stories played out with each song coupled with dance acts and high stunts. The costumes are amazing and you instantly love the characters.

Its a great Cirque show with the flare of The Beatles and one of the best ones!"
Beatles Love,"All I can say is wow wow wow and wow. Did I say wow?

Absolutely amazing show with great props great performances and an uplifting overall kind of night out. This was really important as I had a really bad experience at hotel check in earlier that day that kind of ruined my day until the show.

Special commendation to the Mirage Hotel and Casino and also Cirque du Soleil for being customer centric and always making sure the guest experience is A#1. This is in contrast to some other entities in Vegas, its really easy to tell the difference between those who care and those who do not. 

In my situation I was perfectly happy with an excellent first row aisle balcony seat for the early Saturday performance, but as there were seats in the lower bowl available, staff upgraded those of us in the balcony to those rows for an amazing experience. Row F, you gotta be kidding, thank you so much, Mirage and Cirque! You made my weekend, one that was not that great but you were the highlight of it."
Beatles Love,"This is my third Cirque show and by far my favorite.  There is just so much going on in front of you and around you in combination with the music which makes it such an intense experience. I have to admit I dont get a lot of the Cirque action,but I tip my hat to those on stage who do things with their bodies that I could only dream about. All of the acrobatics were executed flawlessly and were thrilling.  Also a treat to see those very in shape male performers without a tacky venue.  A true delight for the eyes and the ears although I was picking some large confetti out of my dress after the show .
I highly recommend this for anyone who is a Beatles fan(how can anyone not be)."
Beatles Love,"Ive been in showbiz for 40+ years. This is the most original and theatrical show Ive ever seen. I wasnt a Beatles music fan, until I saw this show. Ive seen it three times now and cant wait to go back.

UPDATE -- Saw it again last night (3 NOV 2014). Again, best show Ive seen in my 41 years in show business.  This is the most theatrical, creative and spectacular show Ive ever seen. It has so many layers and so, so complicated to produce, but looks effortless. THIS IS A WORK OF ART."
Beatles Love,"Love at the Mirage is one of my favorites Cirque Du Soleil shows of all time. I was not a big Beatles fan when I first watched the show back in 2007.  I grew to love the Beatles after the show and even loved the show. I recently watched LOVE, and still do love it! Haha!
This show is obviously a show about the Beatles. The show is a broad spectrum about the Beatles biography during the world war in London. Its characters and costumes represent each character in the song. For example, a few favorites of mine; Lucy in the Sky , Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna,  Mr. Kite, and of course Here Comes the Sun, with a character that resembles Krishna. The fabulous costumes were done by a French designer Jean Rabasse, and the stage itself is a central stage giving each seat the ultimate LOVE experience without any obstructions in view. The scene is named after each songs. Each scene has its unique choreography which includes dancing and acrobatic stunts, that are your typical Cirque du Soleil routines, but I still find it entertaining since the theme is different from your typical cirque show.
If youre looking for an upbeat Cirque Du Soleil show I would suggest LOVE because, its a show that combines rock with Cirque Du Soleil, which I find unique than any other usual Cirque Du Soleil shows."
Beatles Love,If you love Cirque du Soleil shows or the Beatles then you will love this show. We sat in one of the upper level seats and it was perfect. I agree with one of the reviews I read on here where if you sit too close to the stage you may miss some of things going on. There was more dancing than other Cirque shows but the acrobatics are not lacking in any form. This show is a must see!
Beatles Love,"This was a great show!  Lots of iconic Beatles images and great Beatles music.  When we bought the tickets, the guy said all of the seats were good.  And he was right.  We were on the back row and still saw everything.  The acrobats were amazing.  The tickets were reasonably priced for the amount of entertainment and the show was a great length.  I was with my best friend and we got a little emotional when they played Help but the lady next to us went from having a mild religious experience to full blown meltdown when they played Blackbird.  If you are a Beatles fan, I would highly recommend it."
Beatles Love,"LOVE was not what we expected.  It lacked the usual cirque stunts that we have been accustomed to seeing... The dancing was good, but for $100+ a ticket,
It was definitely way overpriced.  

Out of all the cirque shows, this ranks the lowest, if not the lowest.  Wait, I take it back, Kris Angel sucked even more.

If you like the Beatles, you might like the show.  But dont expect much more than music and dancing.  Better yet, buy a CD and save $180 dollars."
Beatles Love,"Wonderful show, beautifully performed.

A few side notes:
1. It was simply too loud.  Im 34...and man, my ears were ringing when we left.
2. We had the WORST seats in the house, but we still saw 80% of everything.  Section 206, Row U, Seats 1 and 2.
3. Im 53, petite build  and I was overflowing in the seat.  Not sure how everyone fit in!

As you can see, these 3 items are completely separate from the show and geared toward the theatre."
Beatles Love,"If any show should be on a persons bucket list, this should be it.  Because the ticket prices are at the high-end, I could only afford seats in section 208 but I recommend booking the upper level.  Much of the show takes place above the audience so our seats were perfect.  Even one part of the show involves the whole audience and our seats again provided a superior vantage point.  

So a couple of thoughts to help you if considering this show.  It is not a Beatles tribute with acrobatics.  It is a Cirque Du Soleil show set to the Beatles music.  The difference?  The performers are still the focal point (vs. the Michael Jackson show which was a tribute to MJ performed by Cirque Du Soleil). 

Second, for this show it is as if they have taken movie special-effects and brought them to a live audience (in terms of the sets, scene changes, choreography).  It is jaw dropping. 

Third,  the athleticism of the performers is remarkable and yet understated as it is used to advanced the shows theme.  

In sum, WOW."
Beatles Love,"In order to enjoy this show like I did you have to:
1) Be a fan of The Beatles
2) Be a fan of Music in general
3) Be a fan of art

If you dont meet any of these, and youre just looking for a circus act with crazy stunts, then this show is not for you. Youd like other Cirque Du Soleil shows better like O.

I guess I cant say much else but that youll really like the show if you meet at least 1 of the conditions I listed above. Look on The Mirage website for deals on tickets."
Beatles Love,"This show takes you through the history and revolution of both the English country as well as that of the Beatles personal experiences (if you have a little bit of the background on them i.e. current events, inspiration, religion, drug use, etc.). The song selection varies from some of the more mainstream songs to the less known ones. Performances were colorful, vibrant, emotional, and beautifully displayed. There is so much going on, you dont know where to focus on, but its a stupendous show. Definitely a must see!"
Beatles Love,"I will preface this review by saying that I am a Vegas local and have seen pretty much all the other Cirque shows, so this show didnt really shine as much in comparison. Also, Im familiar with some Beatles songs, but by no means am I an avid fan so I might not be as excited about this show as some other fans might be. 
I guess the reason why I like this show less than the others is because there are a lot less of the Circus elements which I really love. There was more dancing than acrobatics so it was overall less exciting for me. 
Some pros: The theater layout is great, and it is a little smaller than the others so it seems like you have a front row seat and youre right up in the action. Also, the show is well thought out and they did use a lot of the more well known Beatles songs so like me, if youre not a die hard fan, at least you can recognize some of the tunes."
Beatles Love,"Sub par
Music of the Beatles - great

The sheet turning into a ship was one of the best cirque moments. 

Id rather have stayed home n listen to the Beatles. 
Hey but t was still better than ONE!

Ive enjoyed every other show, but these 2 I wanted a refund!"
Beatles Love,"This show is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life! For frame of reference allow me to give examples of things I have seen that cannot compete with this show:

-Assisted with childbirth
-Watched numerous car accidents in progress (three with fire involved)
-Seen people tased in real life
-Done CPR, brought back a few
-Seen bad people arrested and good people saved


The point being, this show is so much cooler than anything I can ever imagine. It was truly mind-blowing. To the cast, please let me say you are all amazing artists. YOU are what makes this show. I hope you read this and share with your peers how much what you do means to us. Seeing your dancing and precision is truly inspiring, especially for those of us with two left feet. The music was incredible, the dancing and performance incredible. It was just wondrous. I only wish I could afford to take everyone I know there, because I cant think of anyone who wouldnt be blown away by your performance. When I win the Powerball this week, I will contact the show and try and get a private performance for me and a  few hundred pals.

Thanks Cirque du Soleil- LOVE. The world is a better place for this show being in existence."
Beatles Love,"I have always wanted to see Cirque du Soliel.  I watched the most thought provoking, visual, and breathtaking show I have ever seen.  I would have to go 5 or 6 times to see everything that was going on.  I highly recommend this to all my family and friends, and now to all my yelp friends as well.  It is a must see!!!"
Beatles Love,Incredible! Absolutely mesmerizing. One of the very best parts of my trip to Vegas. Highly recommended. Rekindled my love for The Beatles.
Beatles Love,"Holy cow! Beatles LOVE Cirque show is hands down the best show Ive seen! Visually breath-taking, stylistically surreal, beautifully choreographed and designed, powerful symbols and theme, etc. Haha couldnt help but sing along to the Beatles songs I did know lol. Love it and highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars easy!"
Beatles Love,"This was our sixth Cirque show and it was awesome! Im going to include this first so you dont waste your money on seat upgrades: the floor seats arent the best seats in the house. Dont spend the $200+ per ticket because youll actually miss some of the performers. We had the very last row and loved our seats- which I know sounds strange but let me explain. When you click on the seating for the stadium, the stage looks huge. However, the show is divided up into four stage sections so that each section gets its own show for the most part. Also- the stadium seating is extremely steep so even the back row is closer than you would ever expect. The show has so many performers, and a lot going on in the air above the seats past the stage- this is what you wouldnt see if you were in the front section because this would all be behind you. 

OK, the show itself is long and there is no intermission so get your drinks and bathroom breaks in before hand. We werent sure what to expect, but the story covers the entire history of the Beatles, which is very cool, but a little depressing during a few parts. Confetti falls from the ceiling at a couple different parts and there is never a dull moment as there were several stage changes and continuous music. It was almost sensory overload. We werent sure about spending more than the usual cost for the traveling shows, but honestly its a completely different experience (starting with the more comfortable seats) and I would recommend going."
Beatles Love,"Saw this show last night and it was amazing. I can honestly say it was the best Cirque du Soleil show Ive ever seen, hands down. Every second of the show was entertaining. The costumes were colorful and larger than life. The music was a compilation of Beatles songs so, of course, it was awesome!

Tips: Since the stage is in the center of the theater and the seating is 360 degrees around, there isnt a bad seat in the house. We ended up getting our tickets the morning of the show from Tix for Tonight and they were about 40% off."
Beatles Love,"I went to see this show while in Vegas. We were two couples and a seventeen-year-old high school exchange student. The show was perfect for everyone. The volume was perfect, the seats are very comfortable (which is important when youre moving around so much to look at everything that is going on), and the performers cannot be beaten.

Without giving anything away Ill say that in the beginning I was a little overwhelmed. My husband looked over and said, I dont know where to look! But eventually we all kind of fell into a rhythm for watching. There is LOTS going on.

My favorite selections were Strawberry Fields and Revolution but all of it was brilliant. There was one section before Lady Madonna that struck me as racist, or at least insensitive, but I can be hypersensitive. While I am NOT a fan of contemporary dance, I loved the acrobatics - both the actual feats and the variety. 

The costumes were amazing... There was a dress and also a skirt/sweater combo I was tempted to sneak into the dressing room and steal. The entire show is very colorful and over the top and the costumes highlight the songs and performances. 

Truly brilliant although the curtain call is awkwardly long.

So why take off a star? There is a section of the show when part of the audience, those in the premium seats, miss an entire number due to being covered by a prop. I found that ridiculous. Also, I get completely freaked out by being covered, I like to have my face in the open. I have no idea what happened for a full number of the show and thats kind of sad. Because it was so good!"
Beatles Love,"3.5 stars.  Colorful production and good hits from the Beatles.  Kind of a weird show, lots of kids in the act.  Weve now seen 4 of the 8 Cirque Du Soleil productions in LV and its better than some of the others weve seen either on tour or in certain cities (La Nouba, Alegria). We had pretty good seats and if you join and get the M card at the hotel (rewards card), theyll give you a discount on the show price. Most of these shows are only 90 mins so if you really hate the show, youre not tortured too long.
The seats in this theater are some of the most comfortable CS seats Ive ever sat in.
Dont get the seats up close to the stage, there are aerials and youre better off in the middle section seats. Whats cool is there are bathrooms inside the theater!
The show tosses a lot of confetti into the crowd.  Dont wear a lot of goop in your hair."
Beatles Love,"Great show and we arent even Beetles enthusiast. We took our 7 year old with us who has been learning about the Beetles in music class. He enjoyed as much, if not more, than we did. Great music and great performances. We have been to several Cirq shows and really enjoyed this one. Music selection always plays a big part."
Beatles Love,"Dude. This was awesome. One of my best experiences.
I liked the British atmosphere in the entrance, I took pics with the ushers.
 I love the magical world of Cirque du Soleil. I love the intensity, talent and dedication of the performers. It was so nice hearing all the great Beatles songs. The performers that stuck out to me was the guy who was on the seesaw way up in the sky, and went around in a 360! wow!! And I liked the girl hanging from a rope doing ballet. That was so beautiful. 
I do wish it was more upbeat and had more of the mainstream hits. There were some melancholy parts. 
Afterwards I had fun in the gift shop buying souvenirs. I still wear my red Love shirt. 
Excellent show! groovy."
Beatles Love,"Now when something is considered girly, what are the official criteria for being girly?  As this may very well be a subjective matter, everyone can admit a few things that I will state do in fact shows that something is girly.  

-That something has lots of pretty and cute stuff, usually in the bright colored variety.  Pretty, pink anything is magnets girls eyes.  Why do you think the entire Barbie universe is all pink?  I highly doubt an Emo-Barbie dressed in black with all kinds of pierces and hair over her face would sell.     

-There has to be a lot of singing and dancing involved.  Ever watched an episode of Glee?  I have, and its not my cup of tea.  Glee is the perfect example of a girly television show.  

-Boy bands are most definitely girly.  I thought they were a fad.  Since realizing little girls now idolize this band called One Direction (unless thats already past), I found out boy bands arent extinct.  Back when I actually paid attention, it was New Kids on the Block (on their way out), Backstreet Boys, and N Sync that were the popular ones.  I admit...I did like some of those songs.  
  
This brings me to this Cirque du Soleil, Beatles Love.  The show is an eclectic mixture of their songs with acrobats and dancers moving around all over the stage.  Dancing, oh yes, there was a lot of dancing.  Singing you ask?  Throughout the show, they bring you through series of historical backdrops played out by song.  Coloring of it all was magnificent, and yes, there were a lot of bright colors.  

As one of the most popular bands ever, they were arguably the best boy band ever.  Songs sung then are still very contemporary to the ear.  One big difference between this boy band and any after them is that they actually sang some songs with meaning.  It wasnt just about the lovey, dubey bull.  

Every seat in the theatre is a good seat.  The stage is right in your face and the performance is very intimate.  For hardcore Beatles fans, this is a must.  For casual fans the enticing visuals will pull you in.  Though I didnt recognize every song, as a music fan it was a head bobbing good time.  All the girly song and dance choreography gelled with the stage design wonderfully.  If saying I liked this Call me girly if youd like, but the show was fulfilling."
Beatles Love,"Amazing! Sat in sec 202 row M - 7 rows from the stage and LOVEd every moment of this show. The music, screen projection, costumes, cast, everything is just wonderful. This is a Vegas must see!"
Beatles Love,"BEST SHOW IN VEGAS!!!!!
Ive seen almost every show in this town.
Ive seen LOVE 6+ times.
I was not a Beatles fan before. I was after the first performance.
My only beef is the performers are getting a little stale and less enthusiastic than before. 

I only have 2 complaints with the acts. First, ditch the bird, clown routine. Sucks.
Second, you guys still havent found a good dancer for Here Comes the Sun.
If Cirque wants to contact me, Ill explain why you still havent gotten it right. And how to fix it.
Those are the only 2 sour notes in the show.
The black couple who does the tap routine! Still awesome after all this time!!!!"
Beatles Love,"Talk about visual orgasms! As a Beatles fan, I was so excited to watch LOVE as my first Cirque show during my first trip to Vegas, and it actually exceeded expectations.

Favorite performances were Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and Octopuss Garden, but all of the song interpretations were amazing. Im also glad they included my much beloved Eleanor Rigby.

Pro-tip: After asking at will-call if they had better seats available, we were moved from Section 209 Row R to Section 200 Row N. There really is no bad seat in the theatre, but its good to note that Row N is at the edge of the bedsheets/clouds used to cover the lower audience during one number. We were able to see what went on above the sheets as well as the actors moving underneath. Double win!"
Beatles Love,"LOVE is a very different Cirque du Soleil show. 

Zarkana, and many of their traveling shows like OVO, emphasize the Cirques more traditional circus performances, but have been dressed up in Cirque du Soleil style with ostentatious costumes and extravagant set designs. Your focus while watching these shows is often on the act on stage -- whether its a high-wire act or two acrobats on a spinning wheel -- and less so about what is happening around them.

LOVE pulls you in from every angle imaginable, and more than just literally. 

The seating is set up like a Maltese cross, where everyone gets a different view and angle of whats happening on the stage. But youre also surrounded by giant digital screens that display video wallpaper that complements each performance, hanging semi-transparent fabric screens that drop down every so often when projected silhouettes of the Beatles are needed to put an era of Beatlemania into context, and sound effects and live music that emanate from the theatre and your seats headrest, which creates a fully immersive, panoramic experience.

Whats more, the performances on stage that meld dance and acrobatics to the musical legacy of the Beatles often feature multiple performers on stage at the same time. This creates a somewhat frenetic and disorienting effect at first, as your eyes and brain try to reconcile how all the elements you are seeing fit together, and you wonder where to focus your attention -- like trying to focus on a single popcorn kernel in a large pot, with all of the other kernels popping over each other at the same time. 

But if you allow yourself to let go, and stop thinking, and enjoy the ride, your rewarded with a very magical mystery tour that starts resonating with you emotionally, and this is what really makes this show so memorable.

LOVEs music, performances, and its aural and visual aesthetics simply move you throughout, from song to song, as its loose story takes you through the sad and sorrowful WWII blitz bombing of England with Because, some exhilarating high-energy roller skating stunts paired with Help, the whimsical and mercurial teeter-totter and trapeze act performed to the equally whimsical and mercurial Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and the ever-so-poignant Hey Jude that follows the heart-breaking story told on stage in A Day in the Life.

Of all the Cirque shows I have seen, I would see this one again in a heartbeat, to once again experience the feelings of sheer bliss and wonderment it left with me."
Beatles Love,"I LOVED Love.  Im not a huge Beatles fan by any means, but I still got into the spectacle and pageantry that is this Cirque du Soleil show at the Mirage.  People and props fly onto and off of the stage in a dizzying, frenetic whirl of energy and excitement.

The show focuses on the music.  Its less of a circus and more of a performance art piece.  You may not see as many circus acts as you might expect, but the choreography and theatrics make up for it.

Also, the drinks they sell in the lobby are pretty strong and reasonably priced.  We got a large Hard Days Night, and it was well worth it."
Beatles Love,"I love The Beatles and I love Cirque Du Soleil, so why didnt I love this show?  Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing some other Cirque shows and combining The Beatles with that.  But, at least youre guaranteed to hear some good music!

I felt the show as a whole lacked focus.  The set, lighting, and props were more impressive than the show itself....they were amazing actually!  The show just fell flat for me in terms of story and acts.  The first few songs had way too much going on.  I felt like I was watching the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.  I had no idea what was going on and what I was looking at.  It was a little too chaotic for my taste.

I also love watching Cirque Du Soleil shows for the unique, jaw dropping acts they have.  They didnt have anything that wowed me in this show.  Lots of dancing and some aerial stunts, but nothing new.  Ill give them mad props for the visual effects though.  The 360 view was well thought out, so there isnt a bad seat.  

I REALLY wanted to LOVE this show, but I cant say that I did."
Beatles Love,"As with all Cirque Du Soleil shows.. you never ever know what to expect. Every show has a different story line and most shows have the some sort of similar performance acts. After watching 3 Cirque Shows already.. I thought I had seen it all. Was LOVE going to be the same, just with Beatles music?? Yes I thought it was. However... it was least what I expected.

LOVE is completely different. I really expected to come in to people doing the same twirl, jump and mime jokes. I had scored some Winter of Cirque deal tickets and went on a Monday evening. There wasnt as much of a preshow act like the other Cirque shows Ive been to... but it was all good as I was more into the people watching and admiring the stage area, which was very cozy and smaller than expected. We had sat in the back row.. yet felt we were sitting in the middle as the stage was so close. 

Opening scene... I was wondering how the heck will I see half of the show with the curtains blocking... and was getting really annoyed 1 minute into the show. Next thing I knew, BOOM! The curtains dropped and it was a loud applause. Its like the Cirque Gods were listening to me! Definitely felt the audience jamming in their seats throughout the night, from start to finish.

I am so glad we were in the last row. We were able to view the audience participation acts that sadly the first few rows to middle rows could not see. 

Would I see it again? Of course! But make sure to go into this show not expecting a typical Cirque show with the same flips and jumps."
Beatles Love,Very well done....loved the stage set up...every seat is center stage no bad seat....what a concept....other set designers should follow this round stage idea.
Beatles Love,"Fabulous Show.   They got you mind boggled.  So much everywhere.  Fun Music and acceptable to children.   Some of the filler goes long, but really good show and do not believe there is a bad seat in the place.  FYI:  if the cheaper seat hare less...go for it.  Definitely higher is the way to go...Lots going on in the SKYS!!!"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles Love show is the best show Ive seen in Vegas. Just came back from a wedding in Vegas and we had an extra night so we went and saw it again. Such a great show with everything you would want in a Vegas show. Acrobatics, light shows, crowd interaction, comedy, drama, and the best music you could set it to. Its the Beatles. See this show, you wont regret it."
Beatles Love,"Upon entering the venue, bright lights and neon colors invite you into what is the prequel to the amazing Beatles Cirque du Soleil show. We stopped to get beverages beforehand and noticed the drink menu items were named after popular Beatles. Made me want to try every Beatles influenced cocktail!!! We got the Hello Goodbye beverage along with a pina colada (cuz I wanted something cold and sweet). You can add a shot for $4 into your beverages ($12 12oz or $17 32oz). The pina colada was VERY sweet but also very strong. So be forewarned if youre a lightweight. The bar lines are ridiculous. Took us at least 20 minutes to get two beverages. 

The staff were excellent. They were able to direct us efficiently to our seats before the show started (we only had a 2 minute window before the show started).

Seating is easy to find and the auditorium has a 360 degree view, so ANY seat has a good view. I have to say the farther youre seated the better because you will be able to see the entire show from a higher view. The production is amazing. The story line was entertaining and about...LOVE! The performers were excellent and their human strength inspires me. My favorite scene was the chain of bubbles which reminds me of how effervescent the Beatles are and will be for ever. I also want a freaking bubble piano in my house now because itll definitely be a conversation starter.

I am also considering a career change and joining cirque du soleil. Wish me luck guys!!! I highly recommend seeing this show. They have daily deals (50% off tickets), so just call and ask! :)"
Beatles Love,"Great show...especially if you are a Beatles fan.  Cirque du Soleil really did out do themselves.  Their amazing performers and the music of the Beatles are an inspired combination.  First off the design of the theater is very nice.  The stage is shaped in an X with movement coming in from all directions so every seat has a good view of the action.  The show itself is a spectacle.  Performers fly in from every direction, from the floor or down from the ceiling.  It is borderline overwhelming, in mostly a good way... though I did seem to enjoy the more low key sections that focused on a single or small group of performers.  The performer on the 360 swing near the ceiling and the rope dancer performances where some of the most breath taking sequences of the show.

Overall, very happy I finally saw the show and my GF who is not a Beatles fan at all enjoyed the show almost as much as me."
Beatles Love,"Really nice homage to the Fab 4!

If you are miffed about the price tag just come out and say youre cheap. Dont blame the lack of acrobats then give a poor review. There were beautiful acrobats and athletic work the whole time, not to mention stunning break-dancing, and breathtaking scenery. It even made me cry at times i got so emotional and elated.

I cannot believe people would give this show anything lower than 4.5. Im also sure these people do not understand the kind of grueling training and precision that goes into this kind of show. Ribbon work alone is not something to turn one nose up at, snobs!

If you are not a Beatles fan and are not familiar with the music, dont waste your time. If sounds like the people who rated low stars really didnt understand the era, what the music meant, what was going on politically at the time, etc. They also didnt understand the storyline which i heard people saying there wasnt one? wtf Beatles music is a story line in it of itself man. I guess you cant please everyone and im really not sure what else people expected from this show. It blew me away to say the least.

It felt like a choreographed acid trip at times! :D ... amazing to be able to achieve that sort of effect with out ruing the brain cells and the nasty comedown. Gorgeous visuals, cool mixes of the anthology recordings. I would pay to watch this show one more time.

Oh and  the giant drinks they sell at the concession stand were good too. I think we ordered here comes the sun a mix of absolute citron, triple sec, cranberry and other juices all served in a Big Gulp sized glass. highly recommended."
Beatles Love,"Another excellent Cirque show. Surprise, surprise! This one was so much fun. It really felt like a party! The performers have SO much energy and they really get the audience to feel it with them. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds was my favorite part. Everyone who is a part of Cirque exhibits such effortless talent, its truly amazing. They are perfectionists for sure and just simply the best of the best. The bar at this show also offers fun drinks like Hard Days Night, and theres tons of Beatles/Love apparel available for purchase. The whole show is like a really great dream slash party...it just takes you to another planet!"
Beatles Love,"Theres no real flow to the show but really what do you expect from the Beatles? The show was wonderful with an array of cast, random props and colors in the form of lights, sheer sheets and what not but I felt like it was missing something. I didnt even try to get the storyline (if there was one?) and instead enjoyed the music of one of my favorite bands out there. I was excited to hear that it was their true music and not someone doing a cover and this was my first Cirque de Soleil show so I wasnt sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised and loved that they showed footage of the Beatles performing, practicing, etc The cast was wonderful whether it came to dancing, the rolling skaters with their shagolicious skates going up and down the ramps and not missing a beat or the acrobat. Save some money and sit in the top part of the theater so you can see everything!"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen several Cirque shows where I know its hard to understand what the heck is going on.  This isnt one of them.  I also didnt think I was that familiar with the Beatles songs (never bought an album), but I recognized almost all of them.  Really good show, would recommend if you want to see a Cirque show."
Beatles Love,": /

If youre a huge Beatles fan, you will love this show. If youre a huge Cirque du Soleil fan, you will be just a wee bit disappointed.

This is more of an interpretive visual feast of the Beatles discography cleverly edited together, following the eras of music in England. Dont expect jaw-dropping acrobatics or shocking shows of strength and agility. My fiance and I were feeling VERY frustrated in the first 20 minutes because the show felt more like an off-broadway dance revue with lots of hydraulics and bungee cords, than the usual amazing feats of humanity that weve come to expect of Cirque shows.

Once we realized that the show was more of an artful, visual performance for the senses, we relaxed, accepted the fact that we wouldnt be seeing any super-human skills, and allowed ourselves to get lost in the visual spectacle.

But thats all it was: Spectacle. No substance. The show depends so heavily on Beatles music, whereas the choreography is not very imaginative at all. (On the same level of what youd expect to see during the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade.) 

I usually leave Cirque shows feeling elevated and inspired. But I left this one feeling misled. Dont get me wrong, there were points that were lovely, and parts that were fun, but overall this is not a Cirque show, but a psychedelic 3D jukebox."
Beatles Love,"Not a declared Beatles fan, and though Im ashamed to admit it, I didnt realize some of the songs I heard were even done by the Beatles until this show.  Nonetheless, it was so visually entertaining and was done in such a cool venue!  

Went with some friends who had seen the show before, and they mentioned that this second showing was a whole new experience for some of the show because we were so far up that it gave them a new perspective from their previous seats.  So if youre frugal like me, dont feel bad about going for the cheaper seats -- it didnt hinder my experience at all!"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen other Cirque Shows but this one did not live up to my expectation. La Reve was much better and what I expect to see with a cirque show. 

Pros: 
-Music is great - obviously 
-There are some cool acts - the roller skating and the few acro acts were great
-Visuals - the screens the showed with the Beatles were really neat 

Cons: 
-The story made no sense and was jumbled 
-Much less acro - it was a lot of dancing, it was more of a musical? I almost fell asleep
-There is a scene with Blackbird that started out really cool and could have been emotional - but then they ruined it with the most awkward blackbird cawing and screeching all over the stage. It was so strange. It made no sense. 
-Let It Be was not included in the set list

This was disappointing to me. I wish I would have seen Michael Jackson or O!"
Beatles Love,Love the Beatles...  Loved the show.
Beatles Love,"I was disappointed in the show.  I came to enjoy Beatle music and found the new show, Love to be dark, as did the people I was with.  There was a weird portion of the show that had a man on a cross with what appeared to be the devil dancing about above him.  A clear slam to Christians, while the Hare Khrishna  section of the show was enlightened.  The show over all didnt live up to its hype.  The group of four I was with were not overly impressed.  I was told that the old Beatle show was much better."
Beatles Love,"Underwhelming is the word to describe the show. The music is great but I own an ipod so I could listen to that all on my own. There isnt storyline, just organized madness throughout. Its visually appealing but youre just sitting there waiting for something to happen. I wont say I had a bad time, but at no point was I on the edge of my seat or teeming with excitement."
Beatles Love,"Whether youre a fan of the Beatles or not, go see this show.

Great for a date.
Great for a family.
Great for a solo night to find yourself (huh?).


You can spend countless hours reading reviews or you can take my advice and buy the damn tickets.

Even better yet, start the night off at Kokomos Steak and Seafood. They have combo packages for the two. Bam! Anniversary weekend complete.

You can thank me later."
Beatles Love,"LOVE...Love...love

Fantastic show and well worth the money! It had all the greatest hits by the beatles and their interpretation of each song was amazing...so creative!! One of the songs in particular were so memorable...I felt like I was dreaming in the skies.

It is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show so far. The tickets are not bad and the theatre is great ( you can see anywhere you sit). I highly recommend this show! All the songs are great...even if you are not a Beatles fan...youll recognize the songs and youll love them after watching this show. It was top notch! As you listen to songs and watch the dancers...it felt a little psychedelic. It was a great experience and I would watch it again! 

Great imagination and very entertaining! BEST SHOW EVER!"
Beatles Love,"Great show.... well worth it... get tickets really early they sell out fast. 
Fantastic for dates or that special occasion. It doesnt matter how many reviews you read, its one of does things that you have to witness and be a judge for yourself. I Loved the way they used allot of different curtains and entrances for the actors. every seat of the house is great. Im not huge on the BEATLES but this is something i would love to see again..."
Beatles Love,"I must preface this with the fact I dont like Vegas--the crowds, smoke, and noise are very irritating to me. And I dont gamble or drink very much...

So, I do like but dont love the Beatles...and some of the show was a bit too dark &amp; dreary for my taste. But it was an amazing show, and I loved watching the athletics &amp; acrobatics. It was an anniversary trip for my husband and me--we came just to see the show and drove back home the next morning. 

I must admit that the best thing about Vegas is that I appreciate leaving...theres no place like home"
Beatles Love,"I came into this show with pretty high expectations after seeing Mystere, O, Elvis, Chris Angel, and KA twice (yes, thats how much I loved KA). But I have to say, I must have set my expectations a little too high. 

There were parts of the show I did like, but much more that I did not like. I like the music,  I was expecting more stunts and acrobatic acts since its by Cirque. But what I saw was more dancing and the characters parading across stage. The costumes were definitely very creative. The show also incorporated alot of old England culture and highlighted some of its darkness. I couldnt appreciate that aspect because I dont find anything dark entertaining in Vegas.

Anyway, the show is OKAY. Definitely better than the Chris Angel show. 
Heres a little advice - its a small stage. Any seat is good. We sat in the mid row for around 90 bucks. Had we known the stage was that size, we would have gotten the farther tickets and save some money."
Beatles Love,Went this past week for my birthday! It is an AMAZING experience! All the performers are exceptionally talented! I recommend it to be the #1 thing to do in Las Vegas!
Beatles Love,"I like the Beatles as much as any other breathing adult in America, but this was not Cirque du Soleils best effort. The acrobatics were minimal and it seemed like the focus was much more on drama and dancing: the only d words I hate more than the Denver Broncos and Dallas Cowboys!

The music was fantastic of course, with classic Beatles songs remixed by famed Beatles producer George Martin. Fortunately Phil Spectors garbage Wall of Sound abominations were not used. The seats were great from even our nosebleed section, but after seeing O and Mystere, I thought this show was a bit of a letdown from an entertainment and wow-factor perspective. Perhaps it is enough for other fans of the band, but at around 150 bucks a ticket, I could have built a time machine and boated back in time (my time machine is shaped like a powerboat) to physically see the Beatles in person at Shea Stadium (the only good thing to ever happen in that forsaken piece of garbage...but I digress) instead of paying for my wife, two kids, and me to go. Little Johnny has to go to community college now. Hope youre happy, Mr. du Soleil.

There is one part where an acrobat is swinging around on a gigantic swing that reminds me of my youth spent on the playground, only multiplied by about 50,000. That was by far the coolest moment. Outside of that, save your money and buy a nice porch swing and the deluxe stereo-mixed Beatles Box Set that came out a few years ago, you will have pretty much the same effect for less money. With the money you save, you could pay neighborhood kids to even push you a little bit to feel the breeze in your hair."
Beatles Love,"This was a beautiful show with great costumes and high energy performances. The very first moments of the show confetti flows over you ... I dont know if it was because I was a little tipsy but I found it to be  exciting. I started giggling like Ive never seen such a thing before! I did see something there that made me think, How did they do that?  . There was this carnival seen where this womans head looks like it drops down to her mid stomach! I was fascinated! 

I was skeptical when I first bought the tickets and the sales person said the high seats are the better seats. I ended up sitting in the 200 row. Im glad I took his word for it because hes right! If you sit in the more expensive seats (orchestra section) you constantly have to look up to see everything going on around you. There is this part where they throw this white sheet over the audience I was lucky enough that it ended a row before me. If you are under the sheet you cant see any of the performance. 

Even though I loved this show I was sad they didnt have some of my favorite Beatles songs in there Cant Buy me Love and Eight Days a Week. The songs that they did choose were done very well. I was also strangely captivated by the performance of the guy twirling around with the Teapot!"
Beatles Love,"What a great show!  I probably wouldnt recommend Love to be your first Cirque du Soleil show unless you are a big Beatles fan.  However, you do not need to be a big Beatles fan to enjoy the show.  There are not as many big tricks as you would see at a typical Cirque show, but there are still plenty.  Tons of stunning visuals, amazing sound, and pure energy.  

Guy Laliberté is one of the great creative geniuses of our time.  Strike that... all time."
Beatles Love,"I love the Beatles so this show really does it for me. Its nice to see they changed some of the acts from when I first attended one of their soft openings. For example, during the soft opening they only played Blackbird for 5-10 seconds before they had an awful exchange between two people while staring at a dead blackbird on the ground. Now they play the whole song which is much nicer. If you like Cirque or the Beatles this is worth your time to attend."
Beatles Love,"Sat in row S and being part of Cirque Club, I got a bunch of seats for $50 each.  Im not a super fan of the Beatles but since the tickets were cheaper and my friends wanted to check it out, I jumped on the bandwagon and headed inside.

Usually with most Cirque shows, I usually have to figure out what the f___ the story is and et cetera.  With LOVE, we know what the story is and are there to see the shows interpretation of the songs and their meanings.  All in all, there were many cool moments of physical daring and skill and lots of sound bites of the Fab 4 during their careers.  A few of my favorite Beatles songs like Here Comes The Sun and Hey Jude were played.  There was one moment where they had a strobelight flashing  for 10 seconds straight.  At that point, I didnt close my eyes but I wish I did because I felt like I almost could have had a seizure.  Memo to the show management: Flashing lights from a Japanese cartoon had caused a few kids to have actual seizures!  Maybe tone it down a bit...

Overall, I enjoyed the show and the concepts and even the pleasure of the LOVE theater inside with the glass transparent hallways and fab colors splashed everywhere.  However, I dont know if I could ever recommend this show to anyone but the most hardcore Beatles followers."
Beatles Love,"I must say, I have never been a huge Beetles fan.  ALthough I love the Cirque Du Coleil shows, which is why I decided to see this one.  

The show was great.  The music matched perfectly to the events happening on stage.  I enjoyed this more than most of the other Soleil shows and Im telling you, you will not be dissapointed.  I recommend purchasing your tickets in advance.  While int he long line to get in, over 60 people were on a standby line trying to get in.  Not many of them made it."
Beatles Love,"Im not much of a Beatles fan, unless Im playing Beatles Rock Band and singing Twist and Shout.  

4.5 Stars...so close to perfection...if it just had a few more acrobatics and crazy human stunts it would be a 5 Star.  Compared to other Cirque shows such as O and Mystere, Love relies more heavily on the music and beautiful, stunning, visual effects and displays than stunts and acrobatics.  You are definitely immersed into the show and the 90 minutes will go by fast. 

Tickets are currently 25% off.  Thank you Depression!

Just pray that you dont get stuck like I did sitting next to a drunk old schmuck who had to sing every other song loudly and off key.  On that note, if you see my Mother In Law there, ask the ushers to find you another seat."
Beatles Love,This was our third time seeing LOVE and our complimentary seats in section 209 provided us with an excellent view.  Cirque du Soleils creativity and the acrobatic agility of the performers set to the music of the Beatles made for an entertaining experience.
Beatles Love,"Disclaimer ***I am a Beatles fan but not a fanatic*** ok that out of the way, Holy hell!!! As soon as the curtains drop you get hit with sensory overload I wanted to cry because my brain couldnt process the images my eyes were capturing at the speed that they were coming in. Music is everything mix it with a cirque performance with top notch performers and a top notch theatre staff from the box office to the bar and the ushers 5 stars all around. Every one needs to see this show, unless you just hate puppies, Apple pie, and the baby Jesus if you hate any of those things then youll probably hate the show and should just not even bother."
Beatles Love,"After numerous suggestions to attend this show I must say my expectations must have built up to something the show itself couldnt deliver.  All three of us love the early Beatles and less prone to follow their later work, but still that music was beyond anything in its day (or even now).  Yet we all left shaking our heads and after this being our second Cirque show are questioning any attendance at others.  I will say we are not the artsy-fartsy type, so its likely the performance aspect was just over our heads.  Nonetheless I was lucky to pick up advance ticket purchase pricing so that I dont feel I overspent on this show.

It could also be that we had the opportunity to check one of the final presentations of Phantom of the Opera prior to this show and that performance simply blew us away!  Sorry to see it end."
Beatles Love,"I am a Beatles generation guy, I love Cirque du Soleil, I love The Beatles music now more than ever.... and I hated this show.  In fact everybody in my group hated it.  It was a loud annoying acid trip.  I struggled between falling asleep of boredom and being blasted awake by annoying jumping-and-twitching dance interpretations of Beatles music re-cut and re-mastered in a manner that would make Lennon and Harrison roll over in their graves (they certainly couldnt sleep through it).

Next, its Cirque du Soleil...a circus for goodness sake!  Where are the circus acrobatics? No story, no acrobatics to speak of, and no semblance of order whatsoever.  Most of the time there were so many people on stage that there was NO focal point what-so-ever.

I wouldnt recommend it at all.  Im sorry.  I wish I could.  Its very expensive and we left feeling ripped off.  I dont know why people would rate this show so highly, honestly.  Go see O, or Mystere, or Zumanity, theyre all great.  I wish I had my time and money back."
Beatles Love,"I would give this six stars if I could.

If you are a fan of the Beatles you will LOVE this show. If you are not a fan when you arrive, you will leave as one.

Dont pay full retail, go to a 1/2 off vendor on the Strip.
Get your tix at a discount and a discount on a nearby restaurant.
I recommend the The Range just across the street from the Mirage at Harrahs.

Its an hour and a half show of non-stop music and action.

Its cool that they have actual masters of the music and can splice it so that it fits the show.

I especially liked the featurette of the dialogue between them as they are making the album cover for Abbey Road.

The special effects with the sheet going back into the pit was exceptional!"
Beatles Love,"A must if youre in Vegas and a Beatles fan! This was one of the best shows weve seen and it was one of the best things we did while in Vegas. Not a bad seat in the house, excellent music and the dancers were amazing. Got our tickets discounted via travelzoo.com promotion."
Beatles Love,"This is something you must see when you arrive in Vegas. It is no wonder why it has been the number one show in for the past five years. The music is beautifully mixed and doesnt necessarily follow the chronological format of which the music has been released, it fits where it needs to fit. You must always keep your head a spindle because you dong want to miss what daring thing will pass by your hair.
Go see the show, even if you are a non-Beatles fan
All you need is LOVE"
Beatles Love,"BRAVO!!!!! 

If you are the Beatles fan, watch this show.  If you are not, then pick something else.  This show is dedicated for THE BEATLES FANS!  

This was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I really really enjoyed the set up and theme.  However, they didnt sing my favorite Beatles songs."
Beatles Love,"I am a big Beatles fan and Im a fan of Love.  The show is very well done.  This music is exceptional.  The remastering of the music adds so much.

I first saw this show in previews and there were changes made in the first months following the opening to tailor the show to fix some of the negatively received bits.  I think theyve done that very well.  The one part that I thought was hysterical was not received well by early audiences.  I guess you had to have a sick sense of humor.

The acrobatics and dance movements of the crew is amazing!  I love the car, the telephone booths, and so many moments that I cant name them all.

In all, Ive seen the show three times, and I have been enthralled each time.  There isnt much interaction with the audience before hand.  It seemed like that reached its height with Mystère and O and has been slowly left out of newer Cirque productions.

If you are a fan of good music and excellent acrobatics and dance, go see Love.  You wont be disappointed!"
Beatles Love,"sorry, I just didnt get it. I went to the Michael Jackson cirque last trip and it was amazing, this one was the complete opposite for me. Too much going on, people bunging from the roof and others break dancing and some pushing a vw and others rollerblading, it was too chaotic for me. I like the beatles music but this show just didnt do it for me"
Beatles Love,"Best. Show. Ever.  Great music, dancing, acrobatics, set designs...best EVERYTHING.  Its beautiful, fun, and magical.  Extra bonus -- if youre a Beatles fan like myself youll be in heaven.  Even if youre not all that familiar with the music of the Beatles you will still love it. All of the seats are excellent so you dont have to get the most expensive ones to have a great view.  Yes, you want to go!!!"
Beatles Love,"Overall, I would recommend this show to visitors and friends. Its fun, and more interactive than some of the other CIrque shows, and I sang most of the time.

What I liked: The whole experience is very Beatles. As youre walking in, the usher are dressed like 60s mod versions of Tower of London Beefeaters. Its hard to get a bad seat in the theater, and actually, I was told the better seats are higher up because you have a wider view of all the action. When youre sitting closer to the stage, you end up looking up and around a lot as youre trying to see everything. The costumes were beautiful, and or course, I love the Beatles, so I found myself singing a lot.

What I didnt like:For me, the show started off on a high note, with Britain in its post-WWII days and how the four lads from Liverpool rose to fame. As the show went on, it was a little harder to follow the story (as is typical of most Cirque du Soleil shows.) The other thing that really bothered me is that at one point, the dancers started yelling in that made-up Cirque de Soleil tribal language. What the heck does that have to do with the Beatles?! It was just so out of place for this particular show. I also wish they had picked some more upbeat songs. There were some low/depressing moments in the show. 

How it compares to other Cirque shows: I actually liked the Beatles Love show better than O and KA but its not my favorite. That title would have to go to Zumanity. While its for a completely different audience, I didnt see any low points or annoying tribal yelling in that show. Zumanity is totally worth your money."
Beatles Love,"OH MY GOSH. This is probably the best Cirque du Soleil show Ive ever seen! 
The venue is great with every seat up close and personal with the performers. We were sent to the wrong spot by the usher but another directed us to an even better seat right behind the people in the very front; sucks we had to miss the first few minutes. My only qualm is this member of the audience, a young lady whom Im pretty sure was on drugs, kept on singing along loudly with the music and WOOing after every act. And hilariously she tried to be the first to clap for every performance. The lady who sat us had to say something to her a quarter into the show. Im glad the staff recognizes that type of behavior and takes care of it. The theater is a little chilly! so bring a jacket.
The entire show was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. I kind of want to come back to Vegas just to watch it again."
Beatles Love,"From the beginning, I was floored. Ive seen many of the other Cirque shows and each of them has a different flavor that Ive found great appreciation for. In this show, it start off very solemn, then out of no where it EXPLODES. People running around the middle, acrobats literally falling from the sky. They wanted to start this one off with a bang, and they do an amazing job of it.

Some of the characters take a little bit of knowledge regarding the time period Beatles music is set in as well as the historical events happening then. Beyond that, every song has something you can easily connect with.

The is one act which I still cant believe I saw. There is a guy on a platform at the top, and its rotating all the way round. He keeps doing these mid air jumps and staying on the platform without any wires. Crazy!

Whether youre a Beatles fan or not, this performance will amaze you and be a great highlight of your Vegas trip.

NOTE: Show is probably even better if youre drunk."
Beatles Love,"Very good show..for Cirque. Not a big Cirque fan but this tells the story of the Beatles and to me, the opening act was the best part. It starts quiet and explodes with music. Loved the use of the large curtains and images of the Beatles.

The acrobatics are incredible. Simply amazing at the things these performers can do. Great show - Highly recommended.

The only downside is if you are tall, the seats are pretty crowded, but thats the only bad part."
Beatles Love,"This is definitely one of my top favorite Cirque productions. If you have experienced Cirque shows, you most likely assume what youre getting yourself into is another entertaining performance with tricks and stunts, basically typical circus acts with flair. Well, this definitely stands out amongst the others.

Obviously, LOVE celebrates the history of the Beatles and their music. Rather than aerial acts, contortionists, and trapeze acts, Cirque uses the art of dance and unique stage props to portray Beatles classics and tell the story of their music. Dont worry, there are still some cool tricks they perform to keep you entertained. 

The staging for the show is awesome, honestly any seat is a good seat. Wait, Im lying, dont sit in the very first row! Your necks are bound to be hurting by the end of the show and all youll get to appreciate is their feet. The stage is set in the middle of the room with the seats placed around them in a full 360 circle. There isnt any type of backdrop other than 2 panoramic screens placed against the back walls, which can be seen from any seat. 

Even if youre not a huge Beatles fan (what?), youll still enjoy the show because of the excitement and liveliness the dancers, props, and special effects are able to bring to the stage.

Youll leave the theatre feeling nothing but happiness and truly believing all you need is love."
Beatles Love,Its just Beatles songs with people jumping around. What is really annoying is the way the NO PHOTO Police ushers interrupt you no snapchat or video really. The FLASH is OFF &amp; the phone is held low. The other hotels Cirque du Soleil shows are way better &amp; let you use your phone to take video &amp; pics. Its also very long &amp; takes forever to end. Do not buy the pretzels unless you like them really dry &amp; salty.
Beatles Love,"AWESOME! Great sound quality, very up close and personal.Definitely one of my fave CDS shows. Its not end to end crazy acrobatics, but theres enough. If you love the Beatles, youll enjoy the show."
Beatles Love,"LOVE IT! Second time seeing it! With the kids this time :)

Well, after seeing this for the second time, we decided that we liked our higher up in the balcony area seating better last time. (You can see a lot more of the action) :) We LOVE Cirque du Soleil and will be seeking out more of their shows til we see them all! And again too! :)"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles LOVE was a really good show to watch If you are in the las vegas area. 
It is a busy show , non stop acrobats flipping in the air. 
You do not want to even blink while watching this show!

I was there for my birthday celebration 02/01/13"
Beatles Love,"LOVE love loved this show. 

This was my first Cirque production to attend and hopefully will not be my last. 

Oh the Beatles, such great music, you cant help but want to stand up and sing and dance throughout this whole performance. Or well maybe thats just me. 

The theater stage is located in the center with the audience seats surrounding. My seats were located mid-way in the second section and I absolutely feel I had one of the best spots in the house, though really I think any seat would be a great seat. There are things going on in every corner and cranny of the room as a whole, that your eyes simply cannot keep up.

The fluidity of the performance is amazing, transitioning from one scene/song to the next with almost little to no interruption. The artistic choreography and talented performers did such an incredible job orchestrating the impact, look, and feel of every Beatles song featured. 

Vivid, vibrant, sheer exciting show. I honestly would enjoy seeing this again and would highly recommend to everyone."
Beatles Love,"A truly magical experience. 

What drew me to this show initially was my love of the Beatles.  Being my favorite band of all time, I was excited to witness any kind of show involving them and their music,  I really didnt know what to expect from the Cirque Du Soleil aspect of it due to the fact that I was not too familiar with them.  I was blown away by both.  

The performers were true professionals who have clearly mastered their craft.  The amount of precision and timing these performances entailed was mind blowing.  Not to mention incorporating the acts to fit various songs was no easy feat in itself.  I was happy to see two of my favorite Beatles songs Something &amp; Elanor Rigby included in the show, the performances sent shivers up my spine.  

Not to be forgotten, I would like to express my awe and amazement with the stage crew as well.  The amount of time and effort that goes in to putting on a show like this is really remarkable.  

Overall, if youre a Beatles fan, Cirque Du Soleil fan or just a fan of performing arts in general, this show is a must see in Vegas.  Well worth every penny!"
Beatles Love,"this is an awesome show , Ive seen it 6 times already!! Ive seen other Cirque shows and this show stands alone by itself. Not a bad seat in the house! each time Ive seen it we sat in different spots and each one had a different perspective, every time I saw it I picked up different things in the shows, very cool. They do change things a little from show to show but stays essentially same each time I saw it. I think that six times if enough for me, but this is a show not to miss, go see IT!"
Beatles Love,This was our third time seeing LOVE. The show has changed up a little bit over the years. It is still a phenomenal show with some very timeless music. To the people who sat behind us who felt the need to try talk over the music through the entire show...nobody is paying to hear you talk. Please STFU.
Beatles Love,"Ah.....LOVE.  This was one of the epic moments I was looking forward to while in Vegas.  If there was one Cirque show we were going to - this was it.  I purchased tickets well in advance to secure our seats, and the tickets were expensive but definitely did not feel like we missed out by purchasing the tickets priced mid-range vs. the ones down front.  

The stage is unique and very busy.   Once the show begins - there are people and moving parts flying all over the place.  There are a lot of great props, outfits, stage sets, characters...lighting and sound.  LOVE is a sensory overload on all fronts.  Honestly, I dont feel as though you have to be an avid Beatles fan.  I am a moderate fan, but the show and music create such a unique theatrical environment.  Being a Beatles lover is not a requirement.  

It seemed to go by so quickly and had that....what just happened stare in my eyes after the finale was over.  Just a great show to experience.  If having trouble selecting which Cirque show to attend - put LOVE at the top of the list.  Put some extra monies aside to cover those tickets - you will thank me later.  This is a definite must for hardcore Beatles lovers."
Beatles Love,"This was the first Cirque show I watched. Ill admit I wasnt a big Beatles fan before watching the show. By this, I mean I enjoyed their music but I only knew a few of their hits and couldnt sing along with the lyrics if my life depended on it.

I had great seats - center row, a few aisles back. However, the show works in such a way that no matter what your seat is, youll have an amazing time. They really do their best to engage the senses of those in the front and in the very far back - worth every penny, no matter where you are in the audience!

The backdrops, the acrobatics, and most importantly the songs draw you in to the storyline. You cant help but be pulled in and be amazed. My heart immediately fell in love with LOVE! 

The soundtrack is amazing, even to a non-Beatles fan. 

The show is worth seeing, no matter what your age or musical preferences are."
Beatles Love,"It was a large production with several nice moments but honestly no great ones. We didnt love the characters playing to the audience for applause and felt there was over emphasis on dancing. A few times we felt the storyline was unclear, as if they were trying too hard to match a song. And to be completely honest there was a bit of a creep factor during what appeared to be a floating young girls fantasy with a shirtless muscular dude. I thought it was me but my wife said the same thing when it was over. There was nothing overtly inappropriate, but the visual was off putting. With such expectations of greatness and being huge fans of the Beatles we left tired, disappointed and instead of going out for more Vegas nightlife we simply called it a night. Wished we had seen O like many friends had told us to do.  Best part of the night was dinner at Portifino inside Mirage."
Beatles Love,"If you have ever watched a Cirque show and then come to this one, you will be disappointed. If you like Beatles music, just listen at home and save yourself a few hundred dollars. This show is worse than terrible. You are paying to watch mediocre dancers spin around to Beatles music. I kid you not, you can do this dancing in your home living room. The only people that will gush over this performance are those that have never seen what true Cirque performers are capable of. Honestly if I could give this show negative stars, I would."
Beatles Love,"Scored a free complementary ticket with the purchase of one from myVegas slots! It works, upload the ap and play! For a Sunday night 9:30pm it was packed and a full house. Ok, so Im not from the Beattle era ( Ithink I knew two songs) but the overall performance of the show was, ok. I have definitely seen better Cirque Du Soleil shows (La Reve, Ka, Michael Jackson One) which I thought were much more entertaining, but it could be because I didnt witness the upcoming of the Beattles first hand? Dont get me wrong, people around us loved it, standing ovations and all I just wasnt feeling it as much as expected. Theres not really anything specific that I could even point out that was extremely cool and I guess that says it all in itself. Definitely would not go see this show again, maybe with my Mom if she wants to go.  The theatre is pretty small, the stage effects were cool, but overall I would give this show a B-."
Beatles Love,"As you wait in line for Beatles Love to start, you feel the energy of the Beatles within. The pre show environment, from the music, to the surrounding decor, to the awesome fans, help create excitement and anticipation for the show to begin.  You cant get a bad seat in the 360 degree auditorium. Whether you are seated in the lower level section or the upper level, every seat in the auditorium gives you a different perspective. Ive seen this show three times and I plan on watching it many more times.  Its AMAZING!  I didnt want to blink my eyes because I was scared I would miss something! The performers did an awesome job. Very talented and oh sooo entertaining! I highly recommend this cirque show to everyone!

BEWARE: do not use any flash photography or a British guard may harass you :/ 

Enjoy!"
Beatles Love,"The music makes the show!  Love the Beatles!  
Watching a show like this really brings out the inner-child -- who wouldnt want to swing through the air, jump on trampolines, and dance, dance, dance.   I have to admit though that the Cirque acrobatics were uneven varying between artistic and fantastic to dark and, dare I say, somewhat boring at times.   When theyre good, however, they are so good!!"
Beatles Love,"I saw LOVE yesterday, my first Las Vegas show.

It was mind-bogglingly fantastic. I was totally swept away and mesmerized for over two hours. The sheer creativity, imagination, music, engineering, intricate choreography left me in a state of deep admiration for the entire effort.

It was superb beyond words. See it before you die."
Beatles Love,My most favorite cirque show ever was in tears.  THANKYOU for suck an amazing event!!
Beatles Love,Absolutely fantastic and beautiful show.  Had front row seats and felt engaged with the show and multiple wow factors all through the entire show.  Will certainly return to this show in the future.  If youre a lover of the Beatles and Cirque du Soleil then you must see this show.
Beatles Love,Listening to the Beatles today reminded me of how much I love this show.  Ive seen it twice and I think Im ready to go again!  Love LOVE!
Beatles Love,"Wow.  Ive seen three or four Cirque shows, and this one was one of the best.  Well, theyre all amazing, but this one was great.  Some of the other shows are more heavy on the acrobatics and less on the artsy stuff.  Love is really artsy.  Its also kind of interactive, in a really cool way.

I was really excited when stuff fell on us.  I think other people have done a good job of describing the show, so the purpose of my review will be the following:  I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT YOU WHERE TO SIT IF YOU WANT STUFF TO FALL ON YOU.  Im talking about confetti and stuff.  Its awesome.  

During this lesson, please refer to the seating chart, which I have conveniently uploaded to the photos section of this review.  

SO.  We were seated in the green expensive seats, in section 200.  Stuff fell on us.  The best places to sit are in 101, 102, 107, 108, and the first row of 200, 201, 202, 207, 208 and 209.  Im not sure if stuff fell into the other green sections, but I KNOW it fell in the areas I mentioned.  

When I called to make the reservations, the woman on the phone knew nothing about which seats are good, or which seats were in the line of confetti fire.  That, my friends, is what Yelp is for.  Youre welcome."
Beatles Love,"I expected this to be a lot better. Its a great compilation of Beatles music, but the acts werent as spectacular. There was rollerblading, stomping, and break dancing, which wasnt what I expected from Cirque du Soleil. I was expecting to be blown away by my first show. 

It was entertaining in that you had to look everywhere at once and it was whimsical. Id also suggest sitting up higher in this show (cheaper!) because its easier to see everything that way.

No pictures by the way."
Beatles Love,Been lucky to have seen just about all of the Vegas Shows and this was one I have gone back to as a first duplicate viewing.  Who cant love the music of the Beatles and now add a good visual show.  Amazing - and - you will smile &amp; sing during the show - I do not think it is impossible
Beatles Love,"Not the best Cirque show in town.  No show of athleticism on the level of KA.  If you enjoy music from the Beatles, go see this show.  If you enjoy watching performers dressed up in costume dancing around to Beatles music, go see this show.  Luckily for me, I ended up getting free tickets, so no money wasted.  My time watching this show, however, I can never get back."
Beatles Love,"This is one of the better Cirque shows. Like all permanent Cirque shows, the theater is amazing and you can see from everywhere. You do not need to pay top price for tickets. In off season, they usually have discount tickets or you get free seat upgrades. I enjoyed the music even though Im not a die had Beetles fan. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat with a great mix of acrobatics, visual effects and music. The costumes are amazing. 

I highly recommend this show even if your not a major Beetles fan, its the third best Cirque show in my opinion. The best being La Nouba in Orlando and Mystere at Treasure Island a close second."
Beatles Love,"I have been to alot of Vegas shows and this is by far the worst.  On this trip alone we went to Michael Jackson at the Mandalay, Blue Man at the Luxor, and The Knights at Excaliber.  By far any of these 3 are much better than the Beatles.  I would not go again even at half the cost."
Beatles Love,"What a great show!  I love the entrance to the theater.. and the stage setup allows everyone a good view!  After watching Mystere, I felt that Cirque du Soleil shows are not for me.. So if you feel the same way, then I suggest seeing LOVE since there is a familiarity to the show."
Beatles Love,"You dont have to be a die hard Beatles fan to give a little LOVE to this show... The costumes, performers, music, and special effects were all pretty amazing.  I do agree with the other reviewers that the acrobats in this show do not compare to some of the other Cirque shows, but go in with an open mind and enjoy... especially if youre not the one who has to buy the tickets ($141 dollars each) - thanks Dad!

This is a fabulous show for people of all ages - my entire family enjoyed it and Im sure you will too!  Dont forget to stop at the Love Boutique on your way out - I didnt buy anything but theyve got great Beatles paraphernalia... my sister brought home a really cute tank top as a souvenir.  Now Im kind of jealous - if you go, let me know, maybe Ill have you bring one back for me!"
Beatles Love,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show from beginning to end.  No other stage setup in the world like this one and the performers use every inch of it.  It is pretty different from other Cirque shows w/ the biggest thing for me being that there were no edge of your seat omg they might die kinda thing.  This was more of just a great artistic vision of the Beatles songs which was just fine by me.  

We did the $100 balcony seats based on a lot of recs from Yelpers and I was glad we did cuz of that one scene..."
Beatles Love,"Its not the worst show Ive seen but out of all the Cirque Du Soleils I have watched, this is probably one of my least favorites. More dancing and frolicking around and less acrobatics, amazing stunts/tricks, and somewhat lacks the Ooohs! Ahhhs! That was insane.

I get this was more of a tribute to the Beatles so if youre a fan, you will definitely enjoy. It kind of reminded me more of a musical. Its not that I dont enjoy the Beatles tunes, but I just wasnt too into the show for some reason. However, most of the people seemed to enjoy it so maybe Im the oddball. Dont let it discourage you, bring a hot date, she should still be grateful regardless.

The show was only about 1.5 long with no intermission. I had pretty high seats and they still went for about $115 a piece. Leaving the theatre when everyone was exiting is equivalent to the 91 freeway during peak hours. All in all it was still a decent show and I will give them their deserved credit. It just doesnt sit at the top of my Vegas shows list."
Beatles Love,"saw this show for the 2nd time last week and it was just as good as I had remembered it. Being a Beatles fan I was in heaven. Great music, dancing, acrobatic work , etc. I do agree with fellow reviewers that there isnt as much acrobatics as the other Cirque shows but this show is more about the music.

I highly recommend!"
Beatles Love,"Best Cirque Show (and I have seen them ALL)
O is great, KA with the boards and story interesting, Michael Jackson, depressing. 

This was fun, engaging, well-planned and great music. Upbeat, slow songs and just when you thought you have had enough...bam? There is more. 

We had seats towards the back but still felt included. The theatrics were suburb, the music not too deafening, the actors came into the audience, it was all a great time. I love shows where you are sad and surprised it is all over!

If you love, heck even like the Beattles go!

Cannot wait to go see it again."
Beatles Love,"Great Show but in my opinion I still like O and Ka better. Whatever you do dont pay full price. There are always discount tickets around, you just have to look for them.

This time I was able to find $88 tickets via the Cirque app on my iphone (it just linked to a Mirage ticketmaster site).

I was worried about where to sit but it really isnt an issue. All seats are good and I would argue like others that the cheaper seats towards the top are actually the best seats in the house."
Beatles Love,"I have always been a big fan of Cirque du soleil.  I have watched KA, Iris, Elvis, and I love all of them.  
I have a big expectation from the Beatles LOVE, since the reviews are very good.
Although the show is not bad, it is missing something.  I feel that it is missing a plot.  Yet the music and the performance are fabulous.
If you are a fan of Beatles, I will recommend it."
Beatles Love,"I cant believe this show got such high ratings! To be fair, I must preface this review with the fact that Im not a huge Beatles fan. But I also wasnt a huge Elvis fan, until I watched that cirque du soliel show. 

The seating is circular, so there really isnt a bad seat from what I can tell. I actually enjoyed being mid-way up, so I could get a more aerial view. There were plenty of open seats for the Saturday 9:30 show, so the usher said we could move once the show started. 

The performance was mediocre. There was only one scene that really stood out. Longest 1 1/2 hrs ever!"
Beatles Love,"Las Vegas Valentines weekend.... Beatles Love... The Love of my life... Priceless! With the 1st downbeat we were in love with the show... Amazing... simply amazing... Great songs, music and staging... Sgt. Pepper walking aimlessly yet, presence felt... Social/cultural undertones smattered with awesome choreography and daredevil acrobatics! We didnt want it to end... why did it have to end.... so so good!!!

Couldnt ask for a better ending to amazing weekend... cant wait to go again! Doesnt get any better..."
Beatles Love,"I got the tickets from MyVegas. Although our seats were free, I would probably try to watch this again at a better seat."
Beatles Love,"I LOVE Cirque Shows; I LOVE the Beatles. This was the best of both worlds. Critics argue that its not a true Cirque show because theres a lot of dancing. Yes, there is lots of dancing, but it makes sense and fits the material perfectly. There still is plenty of cool cirque acrobatics, and lots of action all around - above - and below you.

I HATE Vegas, and traveled there *just* to see this show. All the crowds, traffic, hassles ... all the sleaze and posers in that city ... this show made it a *completely* worthwhile trip! 

If youre a Beatles fan, this is a must-not-miss - and if youre not, you might just be one afterwards. Dont think twice about this show - just go! (by the way ... its often said theres not a bad seat in the house - in this case, thats absolutely true!)

Go ... just go!"
Beatles Love,"My world just got rocked and it wasnt even Natalie Portman.

To most of the reviews that spoke to sitting in the balcony, I would agree as well.  Theres definitely a better vantage point from sitting up top to see everything.  This is my first Cirque du Soleil show, and to my astonishment, theres a lot going on.  

Ive been wanting to see this show since 2007 and it took me a good 6 years to finally see it.  No regrets paying the steep ticket prices, its all LOVE. =)"
Beatles Love,"EXCELLENT!

Ive seen all the cirque shows in vegas and was quite impressed with this performance. not only was i delighted with the MO, but really enjoyed the storyline presented in this show which is somewhat different than their other shows.

I also cannot RAVE enough about the props used in this show and variety of stunts =D

i will admit, i am not a beatles music fan, but i really grooved down to this show.

the seats at this show were awesome!  it appeared no seat was a bad seat... also different than most of their shows, the seats were centered around the stage with moveable props... i wont spoil it for you... DIG DEEP PEEPS, AND SPEND THE MONEY FOR THIS SHOW!"
Beatles Love,"This show is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!! I fell asleep. I dont understand how this show has survived so long, it was a choreographic disaster. No tricks, no stunts, terrible dancing, and boring boring boring. I went with 6 other people and we all HATED IT, including a 10 year old who said it was the worst thing shes ever seen."
Beatles Love,I have been to 5 of the Cirque shows this one is my favorite one I plan to go see it again I really like all the shows I have seen from Cirque so far but this one first off has Beatles so you cannot go wrong the costumes the moves from beginning to the end great
Beatles Love,"This was the first time we saw one of cirques musical tribute shows and i was very disappointed. There WERE a few moments of wonderfulness but...just a few. Namely, Here Comes the Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. The 4 ladies who strike Shiva Nataraja poses while suspended from ropes are absolutely gorgeous. And the woman who does the modern ballet in Weeps is a standout. Mainly because its the one time you see a dancer in the show actually dancing fully and not just marking. The most disappointing this was their non-usage of apparatus &amp; all the extra noise added to the Beatles wonderful songs!"
Beatles Love,"The best show Ive ever seen. So much fun, lots of audience interaction. Be in the first few rows or near the ends of each row if you can!"
Beatles Love,This was the most spectacular show I have ever seen. Simply mind blowing. I have never been to any of the other Cirque shows but I cant imagine anything surpassing Love. We sat in the  D section  and had no trouble at all seeing. There is not a bad seat in the house. I would see this show again and again. just spectacular!!!!!!
Beatles Love,"Fantastic, energetic, entertaining, fun, exciting, highly recommended!!!!  I have to say that I  truly loved, LOVE.  :)  It is my new favorite Cirque show.  Sorry Zumanity!  :)

Saw Love, with some friends on 7/22/12.  We purchased our tickets from the Tix for Tonight booth at the Fashion Show Mall.  I am glad we did this as we were able to trim off about $52 per ticket by doing so.  

I have seen just about every Cirque show in Vegas:  KA, Zumanity, O, Mystere and this one kept me entertained the whole time!  (BTW, I fell asleep through parts of O and KA).  I was never really into Beatles music, but it didnt matter because the content of the show was very fun and filled with energy.  I just remember smiling throughout the show.  :)

The performers are super talented and there is not a bad seat in the house.  

If you still are debating which Cirque show to see my recommendation to you would be ,GO SEE LOVE!  My 2nd recommendation would be If you dont want to see Love, go see ZUMANITY!  :)"
Beatles Love,"I went in expecting not as much acrobatics as the other Cirque du Soleil shows, but not as little as what was presented. The songs, though logical in sequence, didnt seem to mesh well after one another."
Beatles Love,If you love the Beatles and an action Oakes production then go see this show.  We have seen all the cirque du Soleil and this is their best.
Beatles Love,"Absolutely amazing. So fun, so much colour, so.much great music. This is a show you do not want to miss!"
Beatles Love,"I am keeping this simple and sweet......1st time at a Cirque du Soleil...was a Beatles fan but an average one......knew I wanted to go to at least one show while in Vegas and all of this leads me to one thing: ONE OF THE BEST DAMN NIGHTS OF MY LIFE!!!
Unbelievable, unforgetable, amazing, mindblowing, beyond anything you could possibly imagine. All of that and more. Worth every penny and you will be humming Beatles tunes for the next few weeks at least. So good in fact I would go again in a heartbeat."
Beatles Love,"I was really disappointed in this Cirque show.  I loved Mystere and O but this was nothing like those shows.  I struggled to stay awake for an hour before I couldnt take it anymore and left.  The show was more like a boring dance musical with old circus type clothes and everything was so random and didnt make sense.  The worse part was all the break dancing.  Yes, break dancing to the Beatles.  Seriously... Not worth the price, even if it was free.  Go see Mystere instead."
Beatles Love,Best money I have ever spent on a show. Just amazing the way each word from the songs become alive in front of you.  So much action and emotion. Do not miss this show if its on your list - move it to the top
Beatles Love,"Hands down, with no hesitation, I can tell you that this was the BEST Vegas show that I have EVER seen.  My husband loves the Beatles. I like them. This show was so much more than just their music, though! It was fun from the very moment it started, until the very end. It leaves you wanting more. Special effects, lighting, color, acrobatics, this production has it all! I was in Vegas again after seeing the show, and decided to take my teenage son to see it. He also rates it five stars. The gift shop is also worth noting, because of their awesome selection of merchandise. Bonus: hungry after the show? Just a few steps away is Carnegie Deli, and its as authentic as the one in NY."
Beatles Love,"Love is amazing!!!
I went to Vegas hoping to see Cirque du Soleil and I am very glad I found tickets for this show!.
Great music, amazing performers, customes, make up, acrobatics...and The Beatles! What else could I ask for!
I have to admit I was a bit overwhelmed sometimes for too much stuff happening at the same time but the fact that the show doesnt have an actual story allowed me to enjoy it anyways.
I teared up a couple of times, I found it very emotional, it was just great.
Love show is at The Mirage, right on the strip and I gotta say that there is not a bad seat in the house so feel free to get any ticket.
Cirque du Soleil rocks! And I cant wait to see the next show."
Beatles Love,"George. Paul. Ringo. John. The Fab FOUR. 

I am SO into symbolism, so when I counted four of everything, the symmetry gave me such a thrill. Four translucent screens. A stage with four entrances. Four roller-bladers to go up &amp; down the ramp to Help. Four gigantic balloons sporting their signature mop-top haircut. Four of everything to represent the four men whose talent provided the soundtrack to my parents courtship &amp; to my childhood.

Each song (many from the album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band) comes alive with the acrobatics Cirque is known for mixed with modern dance moves (breakdancing, stepping, hip hop.) 

My favorite scenes are A Day in the Life with the break-apart VW Beetle &amp; the Indian-inspired garb worn by FOUR women (suspended in air) in Here Comes the Sun. 

I bought same-day tickets from a Tix4Tonight outpost for about $115 per ticket for Section 200. Wonderful seats, as much of the magic takes place in the air! Plus, youll be glad for the further-back seats when the bed scene comes along! I wasnt born in the 60s or 70s, but my parents would blast their albums on weekend mornings &amp; when we had kareoke parties. Ahhh, memories."
Beatles Love,"I didnt think I was a Cirque person. Ten years ago I saw La Nouba and, while I appreciated the skills, sets, and costumes, the performance itself eventually left me so bored. Do amazing thing. Hold for applause. Keep holding. Do same amazing thing. Hold for applause. Keep holding. Do same amazing thing a few more times. Keep holding for applause although all aerial somersaults are starting to look alike. You get the idea.

As a self-respecting lifelong Beatles fan who married an even bigger fan, which I didnt think was possible without getting into obsessive territory, I wanted to see LOVE, but I had doubts. Wouldnt another boring Cirque be made even worse if it involved profaning the Fab Four as well?

We went for the cozy two-seat rows right down front. I dont think its possible to get bad seat in this intimate theatre; people argue whether its better to be above or below the tent during a certain part of the show, but I dont think you can go wrong either way. We really liked being right in the midst of things (I was even hit by a flying brick during the Blitz scene. Cool!), and I especially liked having the row to ourselves. Ah, relaxed elbows! Sometimes it was hard to take everything in at once, but the close interaction with many of the characters was a good trade-off.

The show was BRILLIANT. Please imagine this word - BRILLIANT - written out in diamonds across the sky with Lucy trapezing around and between the letters. BRILLIANT.

I dont know how they weave it all together, but they do: the personal background and stories of the Beatles, the phases of their musical growth, historical context, and then also interpretations of the songs. All using the original (if modified) music - no cringy covers here.

I was spellbound.

Spellbound and snuffly, with a very wet face at the end.

Now I have a new problem: I cant go to any other Cirque shows because I dont see how any other can compare to LOVE. So I guess Ill just go see LOVE again. And maybe again. Again, again, again. Its all I need."
Beatles Love,If you dont like the Beatles you will not like this show. I dont but give it a 2 because there is a lot going on that can keep you awake for the first 30 minutes.
Beatles Love,I tried to like the show. After reading all of the reviews about this being the best cirque show I couldnt wait to watch it. But it just didnt have enough action for me. I dont know too much about the Beatles and their music so I didnt enjoy it as much as one of their fans.  Its basically just choreographed dancing to their music with very little acrobatic stunts. Sometimes it felt like people just running around. My wife enjoyed the show more than I did. She gave it 3 stars. I would only recommend this show if you are a Beatles fans.
Beatles Love,"If I had known it was a musical and not an acrobatic show I wouldnt have paid for the fancy tickets. 250$ was way too much for this show.
Dont get me wrong, the production, sound, costumes, and dancing was all great. Love the Beatles, and the little story lines that went along with all the songs were really fun. (But WHY NO HELTER SKELTER???) However, I was expecting to be blown away by first-class acrobatic acts, as I have been by all the other Cirque shows I have seen. 
I would watch it again, but would get the cheapest seats available."
Beatles Love,The bomb.  My sixty five year old dad and life long Beatles guy couldnt get enough of it.  My 13 yo son loved it equally well.  What a show!  Would love to see it again.
Beatles Love,"Not your typical Cirque show.

Ive seen Corteo, Ka, Totem, Kooza, Quidam, and Alegria.

While this show is more about bringing the Beatles music to life (and amping it up with awesome remixes), this is super sensory overload!  There is so much to look at while everyone is dancing around in amazing costumes and revolving sets that come out of nowhere and everywhere.  Kudos to the mechanical engineers and backstage/understage peeps making it all happen seamlessly.  While its fun and energetic, I felt a bit overwhelmed at times.

My favorite bits were the quiet ones where there was a focus on performers and acrobatics (what Cirque is known for)... and didnt lovelovelove everything else.  I wish there was more clowning, too.

The show seemed short and I wanted more acrobatics.  The show had some serious undertones as well (love in general does have serious moments, I suppose), which werent fun to watch but still lovely.

The music is amazing!  I love the Beatles and love how theyve made the music extra special.  Tip - get the CD with cash from one of the many standalone vendors outside the store rather than fighting the crowds after the show.

Worth a watch, but I wouldnt see it again.  There is no set story like Ka, and the lack of acrobatic feats was disappointing.  Come for the music, especially if youre a fan of the Beatles."
Beatles Love,"PROS:
Beatles music
Cirque acrobatics

CONS:
No real plot to the show
Awful song-selection
Poor use of the circular stage
Storytelling was a jumbled mess (similar to 2012 Summer Olympic opening ceremony)

If they produced a Beatles-themed Cirque du Soleil show that was ANY good, it would be the biggest show in Vegas history.    The fact that you can usually buy heavily discounted tickets on the day-of should tell you everything you need to know.

Do yourself a favor and go see Ka instead."
Beatles Love,"There are no bad seats in this theater. At first, you may be concerned about the curtains blocking your view but they dont as they are removed for the most parts of the show and are only there when they need to project something.

Although you dont need to be a Beatles fan or know their music particularly well, I think it helps greatly in the entertainment and enjoyment factor. It pushes it over the top for me. I love the Beatles. Thanks to my parents listening to them incessantly, it was hard not to hear their catchy tunes as a child.

I recognized all but a couple of the songs played and for the ones I didnt I wasnt as pumped compared to the ones I knew.

This isnt the first Cirque show Ive been to but there were less amazing acrobats and more interpretative dance in my humble opinion. If you are looking to be wowed by acrobats then this is probably the least Cirque one for you. The best part for that I can recall is the skating part where they do some nice tricks.

If you want to feel good and enjoy the show as they sing the song at the end, then this is the show to see.

You wont be disappointed. Unless you are a sulk!"
Beatles Love,"This show was absolutely amazing.  I was told it was fantastic but had to see it for myself to really appreciate how great it is.  You cannot put into words the magnificence of this Cirque du Soleil masterpiece. 

I would imagine that people who loathe the music of The Beatles may not enjoy the show, but if you like or love their music you will absolutely love the show.  It really captures ones imagination, putting wild visuals to the songs weve all heard many times over the years.  The show is almost like a combination of a play, musical, and circus.  There are acrobats and wild costumes, light shows and video screens.  

I would recommend a high seat (we were in row 206), if you are not in a high seat you will not be able to fully take in all that is happening around you.  There was even a point at which people in the lower seats became covered up while the higher seats could still see what was going on.  Tickets ar approximately $150, if you are a military member you can get a discount which will take the ticket price down to around $109.

I would recommend this show to ANYBODY except people that loathe The Beatles.  Go see LOVE!"
Beatles Love,"This is hands down the best Cirque show ever. The acrobatics, costumes, stage, props, set, and lighting are incredible. Unlike other Cirque shows, this one has a clear theme that it adheres to, making every minute of the 1.5+ hour show worthwhile. 

You have to see this if you are in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE CDS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!

LOVEd the music, LOVEd the staging, LOVEd the artists, &amp; LOVEd everything!

The first act was overwhelming in a good way!  There was so much to see, I didnt know where to focus on.  

Our seats were a lil too close (7th row) and some of the things happened behind us and all around, it was exhilarating!

I didnt grow up listening to Beatles, so I didnt know many of the songs, but the music was great!  They also incorporated many non-released tracks and you get to hear them talking.  It was like they were in the show.  Its great!

I would definitely come back again.  For Sure!"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles are not really my thing so I was sceptical about seeing the show. I was wrong! Its wonderful and colourful and fun and great and.... You get the point, watch it!"
Beatles Love,"I always say that O is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show, but I cant help but say that this is my favorite, too.  Its just not fair to compare the two!  This show is so FUN!  Weve been 3 times now, and there just isnt a bad seat in the house.  This show brings history, classic Beatles music, dance, and acrobatics like youve never seen before!  My husband and I are huge Beatles fans, so its easier for us to love this show, but we took my parents who arent that into the Beatles, and they absolutely LOVED it!  Its a must see!"
Beatles Love,"All you need is love.. 

;)

Very good show, even if youre not a Beatles fanatics.

Been there two times, really enjoyed the show.

And yes, all WE need is love..."
Beatles Love,"I have seen several Cirque du Soleil shows and this one was different: it was a lot less circus and a lot more show. What I mean is that there was a lot more dancing than acrobatic stunts. This is not particularly a bad thing per-se, even though I always enjoyed the more circus side of the show.

The choreographies are spectacular, the music is, well, the Beatles (not a huge fan, but I have to admit even their least famous songs are catchy) and the artists do a good job on their stunts as well as dancing.

As usual, the plot was not very clear and scenes seemed pasted together with an imperfect glue. 
However, if you love the Beatles, I am sure you will enjoy it."
Beatles Love,"Fantastic. Amazing, amazing show!!!"
Beatles Love,"The imagery and optical illusions were amazing and The Beatles music great, but I found myself to be disinterested in the story line and frankly, kind of bored during most of the show. I will admit Im not used to performances like this and Id probably give another Cirque show a shot if the price was right. Glad to say I did it, dont need to see again, but great to do once while in Vegas."
Beatles Love,"Second time seeing the show and I loved it even more than the first! The first time it felt like since there was so much going on, you couldnt really focus on certain things accurately, but this second time I saw everyhing. Including all the little details I missed the first time. Any seat has a good view. If you cant find cheaper tix on travelzoo, try the cirque website."
Beatles Love,"WOW! That alone should summarize it all!

Ive been to many shows, and this show literally blew my mind. 
the show keeps you entertained and constantly looking around, being mesmerized.
If your looking for a show to watch in Vegas i highly recommend watching this show.

The unique costumes and the energetic cast makes this show very delightful and constantly on your toes.

Nothing bad about to say about this show at all...
The only thing it left me with is I WANT TO GO BACK! 
One of the only shows in Vegas i will watch AGAIN! 

AMAZING! KUDOS! ++++"
Beatles Love,"Bravo!!! Love is by all means my favorite Vegas Show of all time!!! Ive seen it three times already and will see it again next time!! If youre a Beatles fan like me, this is the show youve just got to see... So many good songs and all the acts were sensational! All the special effects, acrobatics, stage props were very well chosen. Lucy in the sky with Diamonds was really neat to watch.  The entrance to the theatre and the souvenir shop are cool... Theres just so many neat things about this place, I never get tired of seeing it again!! Almost any seat you purchase is a good seat, the way the inside is designed gives you a good view. Buy a couple cold beers before you go in... Cant wait to go see it again!!"
Beatles Love,"Amazing show. Enjoyed the fact it had a story line to follow instead of just being a circus of people jumping around doing tricks. The music was awesome, and the sound system made it even more amazing. My husband is a big beatles fan plus he plays music do he appreciated the way they put everything together and blended each song the way they did. The rollerblade guys were pretty cool, kind of made your heart jumo when they flew through the air looking like they were almost going to hit eachother. It was a great show and we will highly recommend it to anyone that asks what shows are worth it. Plan to go again and take our daughter to see it. Great job to all the people who put on the Beatles Love show."
Beatles Love,"I LOVED LOVE!!!!

As my basis for comparison...I didnt need one, this is my first Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas and you really cant compare the shows.  I saw The Chippendales, Le Reve, and Divas and it would truly be unfair to compare these because they are all different types of shows.

Would I recommend the above? Yes, as I would recommend seeing LOVE.

I purchased my tickets through a promo on Travelzoo - section 200 tickets for the price of the nosebleed seats but really, there isnt a bad seat in this place as everything takes place right on the middle stage.  You also dont have to be a fan of The Beatles either...they are all songs you know.  This is one of those shows that has so much going on you dont know where to watch first not to mention the cast of LOVE look like theyre having a blast on stage.

I DO recommend seeing this performance."
Beatles Love,"Amazing show ,first time ever seeing a show and I wasnt disappointed great service and great seats .ever second of the show had me on my ties .i recommend all my fiends to see it"
Beatles Love,"Loveed it!!! Haha really great show! First time going to a Cirque du Soleil performance. I was told this one had a little more dancing then the other shows which is a not a bad thing just a little different. Cool story great imagery.

Highly recommend it!! Fun times!"
Beatles Love,"I love the Beatles... And I love Cirque du Soleil...

What took me so long to finally see this? 

Seriously beautiful and innovative acrobatics, trapeze, bungee, skate, dance and special effects all set to the music of greatest band of all time. What a terrific, fun show!

We sat in the very front row, but the way that the theater is configured, I dont think there would be a bad seat in the house.

A must see for Beatles fans and/or Cirque du Soleil fans. This is my favorite Cirque show to date (of the ones Ive seen anyway)!"
Beatles Love,"I LOVE THIS SHOW! 
Being a huge Beatles fan I was expecting a lot going in and it did not disappoint. All of the best Beatles songs were presented with some creative visual performances. Some were beautiful and fun like Octopuss Garden and Here Comes the Sun. Others were haunting like Blackbird and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. A wonderful smorgasbord of sound and visuals put together to create an incredible show.

The best part of the show, however, was not all the acrobatics and visual performances, though impressive. It was getting to hear the Beatles recording sessions with actual dialogue in between songs. It was wonderful to get to hear their banter, stuff I had never heard before.

Even if youre not a Beatles fan, see this show. If you are a Beatles fan, you are in for a huge treat."
Beatles Love,"Just saw this in Vegas this weekend for my moms 60th birthday. There was a group of 10 of us and we took up half a row! We all met at the REVOLution Bar before the show for drinks. Its a fun bar and you can sit in the letters of revolution. Nice and cute server too and its pricey, but its Vegas!

For the show we had the perfect seats. We were 6 rows up (above the VIP section) and right in the center. I will say this again- for Cirque Du Soleil, you do not want to be too close. Last time I went to a show and sat VIP I constantly had to move my head back and forth to see what was happening and felt that I missed a lot for lack of peripheral vision. This time this did not happen. We were far enough back that we could see the whole stage and all that was happening. Cirque shows usually have so much going on at the same time, and this show was no exception. I definitely recommend sitting further back to try and catch all that is going on.

So the show was awesome. Obviously if you LOVE the Beatles (and who doesnt?) you will enjoy it that much more. The whole show was very artsy and more like a choreographed dance/play than another show Ive been to. It was very trippy and every song had its own different interpretation. It gave you a lot to think about and also had a lot of moments where you say,  how did they do that??!!

So although I would have preffered a little more acrobatics and crazy stunts, the show was still very intertaining and pretty incredible. I mean the costumes and creativity were unreal and I really enjoyed the mini acts. It was a great show, very well done, and well worth it if you like Cirque, Beatles, and have extra time in Vegas.

I cant wait for my next show!"
Beatles Love,"This was one of the best shows I have ever seen in my life!  Although its the only Circque du Soleil show Ive seen, the show was extremely memorable.  I enjoyed the tribute to the Beatles, the songs, the performers, the acrobatic performances, the stage props and antics, etc., etc!  

I cannot believe how strong and muscular the performers are!!  There were these 4 women performers sitting in a crossed legged position and then they were lifted straight up into the air by ropes they had intertwined around themselves and maintained the crossed legged position as if they were levitating!  WOW!!!  Definitely not an ounce of body fat on any of the performers!  This is a must see if you are ever in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"Beautiful theatrics and costumes, great music.....

Man I feel like the outcast giving 3 stars when everyone else is giving 5!  But I have to be honest and this is only my opinion.  This show by all means does not suck, I just dont like it as much as I like the other Cirque shows.

This is not like your typical cirque show.  I made the mistake of going in expecting to see all the fun bendy and crazy stuff from the other shows Ive seen - O, Mystere, KA, Kooza, and Zumanity.  Love is mostly dancing, bouncing on trampolines and floating around via bungee cords to Beatles tunes.   Dont get me wrong, I love the  Beatles, and I especially love musicals.  The show started off AWESOME and I thought, ok this is going to be great!  But then they seemed to play more of the slower tunes after and it just seemed to get bland.  Unfortunately, I found myself slightly bored and even fell asleep a couple of times during the bouncing and rain boot stepping.  Im not the only one either, I caught my fiance and a few other people around me dozing off as well. haha

There is an act I loved though- the one with Something in The Way she Moves...BEAUTIFUL!
 
This show focuses more on the music, the beauty of the costumes and stage, the visual effects and lights.  They even play conversation clips of the famous quartet.  Theres quite a number of symbolism going on here as my friend explained, a lot of acting to complement the songs.  

There doesnt seem to be a bad seat in the theater since the stage is in the middle with seats surrounding it.  We bought our tickets from the discount tickets booth on the strip (90 - 100 bucks?), so I recommend checking that out first before paying full price at the Mirage, where its playing."
Beatles Love,"First things first, had I not seen Absinthe the night before, I may have been more impressed with Love.  I am a huge fan of the Beatles and was slightly disappointed in this production.  My biggest complaint would be that at times there was just entirely too much going on at the same time.  If that is part of the Cirque formula, it didnt work for me.  It is however quite an extravagant show.  The choreography and acrobatics are excellent, but at times it just didnt go with the music.
 
I can see the allure to this show, and it is definitely family friendly if you need an age appropriate show.  I guess having seen the Fab Faux several times has jaded me when it comes to Beatles shows."
Beatles Love,"I put off seeing this show for many years because I am not a Beatles fan by any stretch. Many of their songs are familiar to me but none are in my itunes.  But the GF wanted to go and so we double dated with some friends.
 
The showroom is more like a stadium. I dont think that there is a bad seat in the house. The seats were very comfortable.  Once the show started with the exception of my GF I for got about everyone around me.

This show is audibly and visually stunning. The performances and stunts are absolutely amazing.

I highly recommend."
Beatles Love,"Mesmerizing! This is an amazing visual performance you wont forget. It was at times dream-like, acrobatic, funny, dramatic. Its an added bonus if you like the Beatles. I was fully entertained and was so thankful to be able to experience this. Go!"
Beatles Love,"We went to the love show this past Saturday with a group to celebrate my birthday. This was my THIRD time seeing this show and everyone elses first. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this show and will continue to see it on my trips to Vegas. They have changed the show a bit from the first two times I have seen it but change is good :) Everyone in our group was blown away by the choreography of the show. It truly is an amazing visual experience!!! I have seen a few cirque du soleil shows in Vegas and this is by far the best. Not only is it acrobatic but how can you not appreciate the eccentric and eclectic tunes of The Beatles? Its a moving experience that left me overwhelmed with tears from feeling so happy to be able to witness such an amazing show. I highly recommend this show to anyone who appreciates music, talent, and an open mind. This show will give you all that and more. A truly amazing and memorable experience!The Best Show in Vegas Hands Down!"
Beatles Love,"Im not a huge fan of Cirque De Soleil, but when my friends aunt offered to buy us tickets for Love, I was set on going.  

The trippy, colorful show got a little old towards the end, but it was nonetheless flawless.  I kind of wished I was on some sort of hallucinogen during the show.  There were parts that were pretty moving, at least for me...many parts were related to historical events that were going on during the time the Beatles were at their prime.  

There are speakers on every seat, so sound is not a problem.  We were in the very last row up top, and the view was still amazing.  Theres not a bad seat in the house.

If youre a Beatles fan of any degree, you should see this show."
Beatles Love,"I really love Beatles and I was anxious to see this show. I loved the show, but Ive expected more for the end, and also for the song LOVE! The soundtrack was so beautiful, but the last song acting was disappointed. Even though, I still recommend this show for sure!"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows. This is both good and bad. It means that I find myself comparing the different shows. 

Love is not a typical C du S show. It is less circus and more dance. Some of the dancing and gymnastics are amazing. Some less so. It is also a spectical. Lots of cool costumes and effects. 

If youve never seen one of these shows and you like the Beatles, then youll probably love the show. If youve seen other shows, youll probably miss that mood of subdued eroticism that celebrates the beauty and agility of the human form. 

Cant go wrong either way. Enjoy!"
Beatles Love,"As far a shows go, if youre a Beatles fan, youll enjoy this one. More of a Cirque de Soleil quality than pure Beatles. 

Lots of interesting characters but wish the music wasnt done with as much lyrical license. Hard to improve on something already so perfect.

Seemed to drag a bit in the middle but otherwise what you expect from a big Vegas show. 

Get your discounted tickets....."
Beatles Love,"If you like The Beatles, then you kind of have to see Love when youre in Las Vegas. Remastered and (slightly) remixed versions of the greatest songs from the greatest band of all time are brought to vivid, imaginative, beautiful, and sometimes emotional life by Cirque Du Soleils talented cast of acrobats, dancers, and street performers in a colorful fest for the eyes and the ears. The way the Fab Fours music sounds through the speakers in The Mirages custom built theater is worth the (admittedly pretty steep) price of admission alone.

(Also, because I got a good deal on my seats from Tix4Tonight, that made the steep admission price a little more easy to swallow).

A must-see for Beatle lovers of all ages."
Beatles Love,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Everything about this show was amazing. 

The costumes were works of art, the strangeness of the whole show was totally intriguing to me. There was not a moment I was bored throughout the whole hour and a half. The music was done well and not a seat in the house was still when the show started it was so exciting. The huge screens they kept bringing in and out really helped capture the Beatles through image and sound. I wont give away too many details but they do some pretty big, audience involved pieces that are really cool.

The drinks are HUGE and they have popcorn, which I enjoyed. Also, pretty much all the seats are good. Personally, I would sit at least 10 rows back to really see it all. Down low seems like it might be too close and you might miss some of the action.

I would see this show again and again, its worth the money!"
Beatles Love,"A colorful,  raucous, sometimes surreal celebration of the Beatles. At times I felt like Alice stepping through the looking glass with a Beatles soundtrack. Every member of our party thoroughly enjoyed the show."
Beatles Love,"A great performance and mainly, a hell of a lot of fun. Just one of those shows where everyone walks away smiling and humming and feeling really good.

It is absolutely ridiculous to buy your (expensive) tickets online then have to wait 30 minutes crammed in a tight line to actually get your actual tickets. Not a great way to treat people paying $200. for a ticket. However, that doesnt seem to be stopping anyone. Blame The Mirage, not Cirque du Soleil for that major inconvenience.

Seen over a dozen Cirque du Soleil shows in Los Angeles and Las Vegas and this was very different but maybe the most fun.

If you can see one show in Las Vegas, Id recommend seeing this show before any other."
Beatles Love,"I dont know much about the Beatles, but it was a good show.
My mom really enjoyed it.
We sat on section 207 row L. Paid about $100 a ticket. (Reg ~$160ea)
Seats were good, but I think the best seats are in section 200 and 209, front center.
The stage is divided a little funny with curtains.

This show could have implemented more acrobatic moves.
Instead it was more dancing and waving.
There wasnt much of a focal point either.
Just festive.
The only crazy prop was a beatle car.
Acoustics was impressive.

Now about the huge white sheet that they spread over the audience... was that necessary? 
All I was thinking about was if the sheets were clean and how many tc.
When was the last time they washed it and if its even possible to wash.

Neways....my favorite part of the show was the Octopus Garden and some girl in the sky.
I believe her name was Lucy.

O and Ka is more in lines of what I expect of a Cirque du Soleil show.
They both had my constant attention.
I was zoning in and out of Love."
Beatles Love,"This show was the greatest thing I have ever seen. 

Im not the biggest Beatles fan, but this show gave me a completely renewed appreciation for their music. 

Some of the highlights, without spoiling anything for future audiences: 
- The lighting effects during Come Together where absolutely amazing. 
- Same comment on lighting for Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds
- I love that there are speakers built-in to the back of the seats, it adds to the show. The overall sound production for the show was amazing. 
- The show is extremely colorful, the sets and costumes were amazing.

I cannot think of a single negative for this show. I didnt want it to end! 

Do not miss this show."
Beatles Love,This show is an artistic masterpiece. It captures the true essence of the Beatles.  I am an avid theater goer and this show stands up to the best.
Beatles Love,"Ive seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows, both here in Vegas and those that Ive seen as they tour.  I love watching the performers showing off their skills.  On my last trip to Vegas, we saw the Beatles LOVE show at the Mirage.  I thought we had great seats, and we enjoyed the music.  I felt this show was filled with lots of dancing and less actual acts.  The staging was definitely full, as there were images on the wall, people in the air, and people on multiple parts of the stage simultaneously.  It was hard to see everything.  My friend loved that there was so much going on, and he is anxious to see it again.  I guess it just depends on what youre looking for.  There were a few standout moments that I enjoyed.  The phone booth trampoline section was fun, and at one point, our section of the audience was covered with a big white sheet.  Im curious what the rest of the audience saw while we were under there.  If you are a big Beatles fan, or you can handle senses overload, you should go see this show.  Just note, if you, like me, like to watch the acts, then this might not be the show for you."
Beatles Love,"Absolutely fantastic!!!

This show was worth my trip to Vegas. I am a huge Beatles fan, and loved the interpretations of all of the songs that Ive been singing since I was young. This was my first Cirque show-- Ive noticed that a lot of people seem bothered by the lack of acrobatics in the show, but that didnt bother me at all.

We bought the super cheap seats in the very top row. Got there just prior to showtime, and they upgraded us to seats in the 4th row. The seats were great, but I cant really imagine that theres a bad seat in the house. In fact, at one point, I thought that I might have liked sitting a little further up because there was so much going on above me that I felt like I was looking all over the place and missing things.

At any rate, there were four of us in my party, and for all of us, this was the highlight of our Vegas trip. I would definitely see it again!"
Beatles Love,I wish I could share the experience of this show with everyone I know. Incredible. Amazing. Beautiful. Funny. Moving. Emotionally uplifting. A little more Love in the world would be a great thing!
Beatles Love,"AMAZING!!  Best show on the strip!!  I didnt realize how many Beatles songs I actually liked until the show.  It was one incredible acrobatic feat after another which is no surprise for Cirque but add the music and the story of Beatles it all came together as the most impressive Cirque show I have ever seen. (O,Mystere,LaNouba,KA) this is a MUST see on the strip.  Make reservations at FIN for pre show dinner- its pretty good and right outside of the theatre."
Beatles Love,"While I am not a huge Beatles fan, I do enjoy the music from time to time.  I have seen many cirque shows and this one far exceeded any of the others - I was blown away!

We actually ended up here because we had a glitch with another show and thank god we did, as we lucked into 1/2 price tickets for awesome seats.  From what I could tell of the venue, there were no bad seats.  I dont like to see shows twice, or even movies for that matter, but after seeing love, I shouted, I would see this again tomorrow!"
Beatles Love,"Best show in town! Wasnt a Beatles fan but I left knowing more songs than ever. No bad seats and actually the farther up you sit, the better the view."
Beatles Love,"My favorite Cirques show ever. I love the music, the stories, the acrobats, and pretty much everything about the show. It was fun, but also kind of dark which I love. After the show was over, I want to go again. If you loved The Beatles and more serious aspect of Cirque, you should watch this show. Its two thumbs up!"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen Cirque De Soleils The Beatles Love Show at The Mirage 3x in the past year, thats how much I love it. 

The first time we watched, the theater didnt get full. We were lucky and got a complimentary upgrade to the front row. Awesome! =)

When the show started, I immediately got goose bumps. The Beatles music was so powerful and moving.. And listening to their awesome music at the Mirage theater while being beautifully and artistically interpreted by Cirque was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. 

The performers were all lovely and incredible to watch. Dancers/Acrobats were coming from all sides and angles of the stage and it was all so amazing to see. The glitter, the life, the movements and all the props jived to make the show successful and enjoyable to watch for people from all walks of life. 

The whole show is perfection to me but my most favorite parts are the intro Because, Something, I am the Walrus and of course my all time fave While my guitar gently weeps. Call me sappy, corny, crazy or whatever but I got all teary-eyed during the show and all I could think of was bringing my dad to the show. If there was one person in the world who would appreciate this show to its core, its my Dad. The reason I learned While my guitar on the electric guitar and my love for music, I owe all to him. I guess I raved about the show so much that 5 months later, I found myself in the theater watching it for the second time, this time my Dad was there! =)

Third time I saw the show was just this last Sunday. My friend who shares the same love for music and The Beatles witnessed the amazing performance with me this time. The show had always been a lil pricey but my friend knew somebody who performs for the Cirque so he was able to hook us up with tickets for half the price! Woohoo!! 

*Sigh* Perfection from start to finish! I love The Beatles and Cirque so much, I think Imma make it a regular must-go-to show everytime Im in Vegas.. Worth every fuck!n penny! =)"
Beatles Love,"A great show. Very upbeat feeling and great acts. I would recommend to anyone, even if youre not a huge Beatles fan."
Beatles Love,"All seats are great seats for this theatre in the round. If you are wondering whether to splurge for that front row seat, Id say dont bother and put that extra money in a slot machine on the way! ;) You cant see everything from the front, actually, and may miss some stuff. We were 4th row from the rear and loved it. My favorite Cirque show by far!! Took the 11 year olds and they loved it too."
Beatles Love,If I could give this 100 stars I would!!!! Absolutely amazing acrobatics and the music was phenomenal and had great quality!! I did not want this breath taking show to end!! All the staff there were so nice and the show was simply amazing! The actors and actresses genuinely looked like they were having fun as well which made it so much better! Love The Beatles and love this show!!!
Beatles Love,My favorite show Ive seen thus far on the strip.  Granted Im partial to the Beatles so it would make sense this one would stand out to me :-)  But I also could have easily been let down as I went into the show with very high expectations.  Cirque did not disappoint!  The performances were very lively and fun.  I highly recommend this show...especially if youre a true Beatles fan!
Beatles Love,"All You Need Is LOVE

By Kelly Vohnn

Picture yourself in a seat at the Mirage, with curtains around looking like marmalade skies.  Somebody calls you, you answer quite cheerful, the clowns mime their way and soar incredibly high. 

I know, I know, Im a little corny.  You cant tell me youve never heard of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...  The Beatles timeless music has lasted through the decades and acquired many new fans young and old alike.  If you werent a huge fan of the Beatles before seeing Love, afterwards you will walk away with a whole new appreciation for everything that they have contributed to the music industry.  The band that took America by storm introduced a whole new look and era which opened the doors for a refreshing change in the music industry.  Their ever changing music grew more popular every generation. 

Cirque du Soleil went out on a stretch and coupled popular music to their world renowned human circus shows.  Love is my second favorite Cirque show.  Youll eventually find out my first.  Cirque has uniquely interpreted each hit the Beatles ever made making you sit on the edge of your seat during the whole production.  They really tried to appeal to a younger audience with astonishing aerial performances, the remarkable extreme sports and incredible urban freestyle dance.

I was escorted to my seat by a heavy set girl with a British accent wearing psychedelic British police clothes.  All the ushers had British accents.  One of Cirques signature trade marks is that they will search the world for the right cast and encourage foreigners to enhance their productions.  They use 60 international artists in Love.  I find their use of music very lulling and entrancing in most Cirque shows.  Where as Love brought back childhood memories and I was singing along to some of the tunes.  They mesh in a tribute to the Fab Four using panoramic visual and surround sound in the Mirages custom built theatre.  The end leaves a delightful longing to learn more about The Beatles and to appreciate them. 

Of course you have your Cirque du Soleil die hards who believe that using words AND pop songs with a Cirque show is unacceptable.  I say things change and when they do we should embrace them.  It was very different from all of the other Cirque shows Ive seen and I really enjoyed it."
Beatles Love,"Id never been to a Cirque Du Soleil show, so LOVE was my introduction.  My friend thinks KA was better.  We had good seats near the stage.  The show was definitely a visual feast.  The music, of course, was terrific.  I just didnt get the story... if there was one.  I wasnt sure what was going on with the creepy guy, the old woman, or what a bunch of skateboarders had to do with anything... but it was interesting.  A little short. The Something piece was beautiful.  Everything was nice... just a bit disjointed."
Beatles Love,"My first Cirque du Soleil show on my first trip to Vegas and I couldnt be happier I chose this one!!!
Obviously all the music is wonderful...because its the beetles! But the special effects, the huge screens, and of course all the performers were just spectacular!
Really enjoyed myself!!!"
Beatles Love,"I dare anyone to describe this phenomenal show in words.  Beatles fans would love this.  The show is very pleasing to the eyes and utilizes acrobatics, synchronized dancing, special lighting effects, and more to create a one-of-a-kind Cirque du Soleil interpretation of songs by The Beatles.  I enjoyed every minute of it from beginning to end.  There were plenty of visuals occurring all at once and I sometimes didnt really know where to look.  This is a show that I could definitely watch again and see something that I mightve missed the last time.

100s seating is closest to the stage, with 300s (balcony) being the farthest and cheapest.  I was seated in the 200s and found it far enough to get a perfect birds eye view, but not too far that I couldnt see the performers faces.  If I sat any closer Id probably be moving my head a lot. 

I have become a Cirque du Soleil fan and plan on seeing many more of their shows on future visits.  Perhaps Mystere will be next on my list."
Beatles Love,"My first cirque show and I had a blast.  Was in Vegas on business, a co-worker and I went to check this out on our last night in town.  We had seats in the first row of the balcony and we had a great view of the entire show.  It was an action packed 90 minutes.  My experience with this show definitely has me interested in checking out other cirque shows.

If you are active duty military you can call the box office for a 40% discount on tickets.  If you are on the fence about which show to see while you are in Vegas, I would not hesitate to go and see this again."
Beatles Love,"This was my fourth Cirque show, and the only one I dont think deserves five stars.
Let me say, this is a great show, so why the lower review? If youve ever seen a classic cirque show, you will understand my reasoning. Love is not a classic show.
It is great for what it is, but it is not great compared to what I expect when seeing a cirque show.
My expectations include crazy, amazing human feats and acts of oddity.
Love has a short section of trampolines and rollerblades, other than that is heavy on the dancing and tributes the music (which I guess is the point). Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is the best song/scene in the show, beautiful and stimulating.
I will recommend this show to people whove never seen a Cirque show, but after reading other reviews, I think you can tell that I am not alone in my disappointment."
Beatles Love,"For someone who doesnt know much about Beatles songs, I still enjoyed the show a lot!!!  The stage was very different and great, and there were practically no bad seats  in this show.  

I would recommend listening to Beatles songs before you see the show if you are not too familiar with them!"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen 6 or 8 Cirque shows and this one takes the cake!  Fun,  exciting, great music, venue is awesome. There isnt a bad seat in the house."
Beatles Love,"The entire cast of O was on vacation the week of my vacation so the Cirque Du Jour was LOVE.  Can someone please tell me if I missed some MAJOR metaphor?  I didnt get it.  I enjoyed the music and I dont really like the Beatles but I thought most of the action was lame.  

The dancing pregnant lady???  Ive seen better dancing on early-season shows of Dancing with the Stars.  

The kids riding on a bed - it reminded me of something of a cross between Pink Floyds The Wall and Harry Potter.  

The coolest scene was by far done to Octopuss Garden-I felt like I was in an aquarium with jelly fish floating around.  

Other than that this show was the longest 90 minutes of my life."
Beatles Love,"I had always heard that the Cirque du Soleil Love show was one of the best and wanted to experience this for myself.
It was a crazy and wild show, with a lot of things happening at once. I would say though it is not your typical Cirque du Soleil show.
You expect lots of crazy acrobatics in a CDS show. This one was limited to a few acts, some roller bladers, trampoline jumpers, a see saw guy and a aeiral acrobat. Other than that, it was a lot of smoke and mirrors and trippy costumes. I did enjoy how they integrated the show with The Beatles music though which was the big draw. It was great to hear Beatles music on such a large venue and big sound system."
Beatles Love,"One word: incredible. I was lucky enough to be taken here as a birthday present. If you are a Beatles fan this is a must see when youre in Vegas. If youre not a Beatles fan, then you should still go because you will leave there being one.

This show is an amazing tapestry of the great songbook of the Beatles mixed with the story of their lives all portrayed by the amazing acrobatics, grace and athleticism of the Cirque du Soleil team.

The staff goes all out dressed in their very own Sgt Pepper garb and a few of the cast members come out to entertain the audience while you wait.

A tip too if youre going: Try to get seats that are midlevel at the back. I dont want to spoil it but something happens during the show and when youre in these seats you get to see something most people wont.  Its just a magical experience and well worth the high ticket price. I left an even bigger Beatles fan then when I came and even got a little choked up during the last number.

All you need is LOVE!"
Beatles Love,"Awesomagitastical! 

I really wanted to give this one 5 stars. It was so innovative and creative and well executed, except for the big screens. Seriously overkill and actually detracted from the performance. Reminded me of cheesy laser shows from the 90s. Sometimes, less is more.

Less acrobatics equals more dancing. The choreography encompassed a variety of interesting styles. However there were still plenty of tricks and gravity defiance. 

I really have more appreciation for Beatles music after this show! It was like being immersed in a live version of Across the Universe. Colorful, loud, fun, trippy - a treat for all your senses! 

If only all you need is love to buy your tickets, but it was definitely worth the expense!"
Beatles Love,"I need more stars to rate this one!  BEST Cirque show on the planet.  Ive been four times and each time Ive seen something new and the effects just get better and better!  I am not a Beatles fan but I knew every song they used in the show and you will too!  Its a HUGE theater  and a lot happens in the air, so pick seats up out of the lower level, those are more expensive but you cant see all the action from that close up.  Best seats are on the floor level, lots of leg room and great view of everything.  I sat in the upper section once in that front row and found the leg room was too small and I got a cramp during the show.  It is expensive but youre in Vegas, live a little and get the best seats, you were only going to lose that money on the craps table anyway!  Best part of the show is when a sheet comes up and covers the audience, non-stop action and effects that will make you smile right up until the end, LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!  Pick up the sound track it will be stuck in your head for weeks after the show too!"
Beatles Love,"Loved the show!!!! The best part about this particular show is the audience engagement. I absolutely loved the huge blanket covering the whole show. Who doesnt love the Beatles?! Great dancers, great costumes and best music."
Beatles Love,"As a Beatles fan, I was really looking forward to seeing this show and I was not disappointed! The Beatles LOVE is filled with songs from the Beatles paired with acrobatics, dancing, singing, special effects, and much more. It was almost to the point where there was too much going on.

On a random note, the drinks that they sell in the lobby before you go into the theater are amazing. I got the Here Comes The Sun drink and all I remember is that it was fruity and had vodka (but I couldnt taste it which Im okay with)."
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque de Soleil experiences so I wasnt sure what to expect. 

Pros: 
You couldnt pick better music
Some of the acrobatic routines were amazing 

Cons: 
I couldnt figure out the story (if there was one, if not it needed one)
It was all eye candy and had no meat; I needed some beef 

Conclusion.  You dont need anything to make the Beatles music better (including amazing artist and acrobats); just sit back pop in a cd and enjoy the music"
Beatles Love,"Simply a fantastic show.  My favorite Cirque in Vegas (with KA in a close second).  

As long as you dont dislike the Beatles (and who actively dislikes the Beatles besides weirdos that think theyre too mainstream), YOU WILL LOVE THIS SHOW."
Beatles Love,"Im 66 and handicapped.  I attended with my rented power scooter and sat in a seat designed for mobility impaired!  My circumstances could not have been handled with more sensitivity!  AND having been of the generation of the British Invasion and having seen The Beatles introduction on the Ed Sullivan Show then eventually seeing 
The Beatles live concert in 65 all I can say is Cirque NAILED IT!!!! I felt whisked back in time to the point of tears!  MIRAGE....you NAILED IT with your absolute could not be better accomadations!"
Beatles Love,"Best show weve seen!
Its amazing watching everything happen at once. The music, performers, and video. If you are looking for a show, and dont know what to see...this is a Must!"
Beatles Love,"What happened to this place?!? Saw this show a few years ago and thought it was amazing. This venue has gone downhill! So sad. The performance was ok, not as great as I remembered. The theatre was only half full, and the snack bar was a mile long!"
Beatles Love,"I liked the experience but amidst the performance the show came to a halt. The ushers informed us that it was some type of safety mechanism that stops the performance to prevent a mishap. With that said, this whole issue that lasted a good 30 mins brought the overall review down a peg or two."
Beatles Love,"Weve seen a lot of Cirque shows and this was the worst yet.  Theres mostly actors and dancers but few stunt people.  Too much time is spent with the actors and not enough time with performance art.  I guess its all about the music...and thats a good thing.  The show is very dark and spends way too much time in dark, dingy England with hippies.  I would have loved to see more bright beautiful scenes with lots of lighting.  If you love the music, buy the CD...its amazing!!  Wonderfully remixed for the show.  Whats the deal with the rain boots and tricycles?"
Beatles Love,"I really enjoyed Love, it was very entertaining. A lot going on, dont sit too close or you wont be able to take it all in. I wouldnt sit any closer than row O in the C seating area, save your money... We have also seen KA and if we had to choose we would see KA but we did enjoy Love for what is..."
Beatles Love,"Ive lost count of how many Cirque shows Ive seen ... This one had great music, great costumes (as always), and great acrobatics.  My only complaint (and this isnt really much of a complaint) is that there is almost too much going on and I kept feeling like I was missing things.  Id absolutely recommend the show, especially if youre a Beatles fan"
Beatles Love,"The Good:  First off, I usually dont go to shows when Im in Vegas.  Heck, I usually dont go to shows and I usually just gamble when Im in Vegas.  This trip was different, its another story, and what can I say, this show is pretty awesome.  This is actually my first time to a Las Vegas show.  Its pretty much all Beatles music with a Cirque du Soleil performance of their crazy high flying stunts.  There is so much going on that you shouldnt get bored and youll end up leaving thinking how did they do that?

The Bad:  The lines, entering and exiting.  Its pretty much near the casino so there are huge bottlenecks.  Security is a bitch, they were busting people left and right for pics or vids.   Dont do it, they will catch you.

The Ben:  Glad this was my first show.  It was good and I might be convinced to go to another show, just let me get my gamble on first :D"
Beatles Love,Excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances. Additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.
Beatles Love,"This show was beautiful! My group came here for Homecoming and it was a lot of fun!  Just like any Cirque show, theres not much talking and sometimes I was a little lost, but as always the Beatles music was pristine and the creative ways the performers complimented the music was unforgettable.  Overall, a great show."
Beatles Love,"Love!!  I love!
Man almost all my senses were heightened during this show.  
It was just beautiful.  
My dad teared up a bit watching it.
Even if youre not a Beatles fan, you will love it.
Its amazing how it brings together pop culture, dance, music, visual effects, acrobatics, and humor to pull at your heart strings.
I got 20% off my ticket looking for deals on Mirages website. I also saw later 50% off deals through Travelzoo.com.  Still, well worth the $115 I paid.  
We sat in section 209  row N and our seats were perfect!  We were included in the special effect and had a great view of everything going on.
Amazing!  My dad said he wants to make seeing it an annual thing."
Beatles Love,"Saw it for the second time last week. If you are ehh its ok on Beatles music you will still like the show. If you love the Beatles, you will pee your pants in excitement. 

The theater is fairly small and even the back row of the cheap seats has a good view of the action. In fact, I think the cheap seats are better than up front, because they allow you to see more of the action, for half the price. 

Still, Id pay full price to see this over and over again."
Beatles Love,"Ive seen Mystere and Ka, but this show blows them both out of the water!

THE BEST SHOW IVE EVER SEEN! And Im into arts and entertainment, so Ive seen quite a few amazing shows.

We purchased discounted seats (front row) at Tickets4Tonight - which I highly recommended if you are looking for last minute discounted shows and dinners. But there are no bad seats in this venue (theater of the round).
 
I cried about 5 times (no, I wasnt drunk). It was just such a beautiful show.

In the end, Sgt. Pepper came out and handed me and another audience member a rose (I nearly died).

It really hits home if youre a Beatles fan, and if not... you will still absolutely love this show!"
Beatles Love,"What a great show!  I saw the Elvis show @ Aria and found it boring and lame.  Half of our group fell asleep.  I was a little apprehensive about seeing another Cirque musical based on yet another rock n roll icon, but wow they did the Beatles right.

The theater itself is awesome.  We had nosebleed seats and felt like we were right in the middle of the action.  Great music, costumes, stunts, theater.  My new favorite Cirque show."
Beatles Love,Probably the best show I have ever seen. Definitely recommend to any Beatle lover.
Beatles Love,I felt every emotion during this show. I dont think you would even have to be a Beatles fan to get into it. Well worth the money!
Beatles Love,"An amazing experience from start to finish.  Even if you arent a Beatles fan, you will no doubt enjoy yourself at Love.  

Get the big drink - its $15 for a single and $20 for a triple.  

Blackbird, Yesterday, and Hey Jude were my favorite parts.  My only disappointment was the lack of Let it Be, but Ill let it slide because the Beatles obviously have way too many great songs to fit into 90 minutes. 

Very difficult to explain in any detail, you just have to see the show."
Beatles Love,"The music, the dancing, the props, and  the audience interaction were a delicious buffet for my senses.  The venue layout offered a feeling of intimacy. I felt like I was experiencing a private show."
Beatles Love,"I dont know why I waited so long to post this review... this was absolutely hands down one of the best live theatre experiences I have ever had.

I may be a little biased, I love the Beatles.  I grew up listening to nothing but the Beatles.  I couldve sat in a room with no performers and listened to George Martins re-arrangements of this music and been in heaven.  If you are a Beatles buff, you will love this for the music alone.

The performers make the experience even that much better.  I didnt know where to look.  The level of talent on, above, and below the stage is incredible.  I cant imagine the amount of work and rehearsal that the performers and technicians go through to put on a seamless show.

The concept and execution from start to finish is incredible.  The ambiance rocks.

Tickets were pricey... but well worth it.

Very impressive."
Beatles Love,"I just have a few things to say:

PHENOMENAL, MESMERIZING, SENSORY OVERLOAD! 

I am not a huge Beatles fan, in fact I only knew a handful of the songs, but I loved the music and the artistry of the show. There were some awesome technical special effects. Every seat is amazing, the 360 stage is a wonderful idea. 

Tip - Any seat in the 100 or 200 level will be a great seat...I actually think its better to sit up higher in the 200 level because you will get to see EVERYTHING and wont  have to look up too much. 

This is my second Cirque show, I saw Zumanity which was great, but very different in style. I have taken a vow to see a Cirque show every time I go to Vegas."
Beatles Love,"Even if youre just a casual fan of the beatles youll love this show. I personally am a big fan and I enjoyed the shit out of this show. I went with 2 friends who were less versed with beatles music than I am, but even they loved it and said theyd see it again."
Beatles Love,"This show is absolutely awesome! The music transcends age groups and trends and Cirque is the perfect partner to present it. If the Beatles music hasnt changed your life, this will. Most every seat is perfect and the sound is incredible. Dont miss it. Bravo!"
Beatles Love,"On the recent Vegas trip Stacy and I tried out a number of shows.  I had the chance to see LOVE a few years ago and wanted to bring my wife.  I really enjoy this show, but I will also say I do enjoy the Beatles music.  As a Cirque Du Soleil  show this is a little more on the dance and signing side of the spectrum then some of the other shows so if you want to see the mouth dropping stunts you might like one of there other shows better.  I had to drop this down to four stars because they dropped The Yellow Submarine from the play list.  That is just one of my favorite songs and it is not in the show.

The theater is in the center with the seats ringing the entire show so you you not have to worry about getting a bad seat, they are all good.  I like this show about half way up since the action is on the stage and in the air.  If  you get to close you actually miss some of the action or are forced to pick from what is directly in front of you and what is in the air."
Beatles Love,Good for any Beatles fan but there were way too many things going on for me.
Beatles Love,"First this is really a dance performance more than anything, with spectacular visuals set against Beatles music. Those expecting acrobatics will be disappointed, but there are a few outstanding acts here and there. 

I felt that the start of the show was a little messy and contrived. But by the third or fourth song the show had hit its stride, and it got really enjoyable. One thing to note I wasnt a big fan of how my favorite Beatles song was interpreted. Oh and try to sit in the second section for the best view!"
Beatles Love,"Amazing ... Just delightfully wonderful (-:
Want to feel good for a couple of hours just pop
Into love the whole experience is perfect."
Beatles Love,"Ive seen quite a few of the Cirque du Soleil shows, as have my other 3 friends. We all agreed that this was the worst production we have ever seen! Theres no cool acrobatics, nothing that makes you marvel and the performers strength and abilities. I fell asleep during almost all the songs! It was that horrible head bobbing kinda sleep. Yes, the costumes are colorful and wacky, but even that wasnt enough to overcome the horrible mash up of randomness. Theres no intermission as its only a 90 minute show. Save your money - go see another show."
Beatles Love,My wife and I just got out of it and we would have paid twice as much that amazing experience!  If you like the Beatles at all do yourself a favor and see this asap.
Beatles Love,"Brilliantly conceived, high energy, creative fun!!  I really liked O, but I loved LOVE.  LOVE has periods where it is ethereal and highly introspective like most other Cirque du Soleil shows.   Love, however, balances the trade mark Cirque du Soleil etherialness with the focused high energy of the Beatles.  This makes LOVE a more uplifting stronger focused experience than any other Cirque du Soleil show that I have seen yet!

I recommend the middle level (and priced) seats so you can see all the action.

The Here Comes the sun Captain Morgans with Mango and OJ cocktail  that they serve at the LOVE concession was great.  

PS  Without sounding crass, I recommend that you make sure you visit the bathroom before the show starts especially if you plan to partake of these delicious lyric inspired 14-36oz drinks.  The show is full length!"
Beatles Love,Best show EVER! Cirque entertains to Beatles tunes. Couldnt stop singing
Beatles Love,It was beautiful to watch!! Great theatrical vision! Beautiful dancing and the music paired so well with the dancing. The story telling was great.
Beatles Love,"Weve seen it twice, which is really saying something because before our first time I didnt think any show could be worth $100 a seat. That time we sat waayy up in the highest section (303) and the sound was AMAZING. So amazing some say it brought tears to their eyes ( I would never admit to such silliness). I actually think the sound was a little better than in the middle section (209) that we sat in this time but I think section 209 is the hot ticket visually. Call the box office at The Mirage for the best deals, the agent was very helpful. We go to Vegas a once or twice a year and we will probably see this show again."
Beatles Love,"If you are a fan of Beatles music, this is an INCREDIBLE SHOW, RICHLY DESERVING of its TOP ratings!  I cannot think of a SINGLE THING negative to say about it.  GO SEE IT FOR SURE!  The actors, the music, the lighting, the dance scenes were all SPOT ON!  There is NOT a bad seat in the house.  If you sit up front, you MAY be too close.  I was in Row M and it was perfect.
Now, lets talk about getting your tickets...  
I had read online that people saved money using the TIX 4 TONIGHT booth.  The one I used was across from the Bellagio Hotel and outside the Planet Hollywood hotel.  After the fact, I have discovered THIS IS NOT THE CASE UNLESS YOU ARE GOING ALONE!  If you can buy TWO (or more) tickets, it is CHEAPER and EASIER to buy them directly from the Cirque web site!  One ticket (Sat night) cost $125, so two would cost $250 from TIX.  I just checked the Cirque web site and can get two tickets for under $225, and WOULD NOT have to stand in line OUTSIDE at the ticket booth.  Could have printed the tickets at home and showed up in time to walk into the show."
Beatles Love,"Q: Is there any Las Vegas hotel that doesnt have a Cirque du Soleil show? A: That was rhetorical.

Ive seen most of the Cirque shows and The Beatles LOVE is so far my favorite. Probably because The Beatles are TEN THOUSAND TIMES BETTER than the Cirque house band playing quasi-rock with the operatic singer. Its not that the house band is bad, its just Ive never really left a Cirque show thinking, Hey, I really want to buy that KA soundtrack. 

The seating for LOVE was circular with the stage in the middle. We sat around 2/3s up and the seats were excellent. I think even the highest cheap seats (and by cheap I mean expensive) are probably pretty decent. Conversely, if you sit in the first row, right next to the stage, although youll be able to see the sweat stains on the performers (how cool is that?), youll probably miss the 75% of the show thats behind them. 

The show was awesome. Lights, sounds, dancers, acrobats, trampolines, smoke, color... Volkswagens (i.e., Beetles). A Fahrvergnügen on the senses. 

The only downside were the couple of guys next to us who for some reason thought this was an audience participation karaoke event. Memo to singers: Uh, just cuz you know the words doesnt mean youre obligated to sing. Just saying.

Love, love, love."
Beatles Love,A nice tribute to a great band! The show was fun and cleverly done with songs. Try to sit closer to the front for the full experience. Discount tickets available so search before paying full price.
Beatles Love,"Excellent! Incredible! Fantastic! The cast are truly one talented group of performers. Unlike the previous poster, I didnt think the show was long and odd. Its ninety minutes and I thought the time flew by. There are the typical flying performers as well as some trampoline acrobatics and even some rollerblading that is unbelievable. There are built-in speakers in the headrest of each seat. And needless to say, the music is flawless!"
Beatles Love,This really was the best show I have ever seen! It has a huge WOW factor. You will be totally immersed is sound and visual stimulation. We had front row seats and they were amazing. I loved how the performers interacted with the audience. I cant wait to go again!!
Beatles Love,"Im not a huge fan of either Cirque du Soleil or the Beatles (not that I dislike either, but if you gave me a choice of entertainment Im not sure theyd make my top 5), so when I got free tickets to this show I wasnt sure what to expect.  But... wow.  It was beautiful.  The acrobatics were amazing.  The music and the dancing and the costumes and the props and the lighting were all spot-on.  One thing that is neat about Cirque du Soleil is how they involve the audience in the show, from the people who walk by and make faces at you to the part where they pull a giant billowing white sheet over everyones heads -- I felt very engaged the whole time.  And yes, the part at the end where (spoilers!!) the little boy loses his mom (Hey Jude) made me cry.  Even if youre not a huge Beatles fan or a huge Cirque fan, I would highly recommend this show."
Beatles Love,"Ok... so it probably didnt help that we saw KA before we saw LOVE.  LOVE is an amazing chronology of the Beatles music, but it is not heavy on the acrobatics.  Dont be mistaken, the acrobatics that are part of the show are still amazing, and you will definitely enjoy them, but do keep in mind this is more of a tribute to the beatles show, and not so much a cirque show.  Still fantastic, and if youre staying at the Mirage, inquire about the guest discount, we got 40% off really good seats: dont sit too close to the stage... u need to be able to see all the screens and off the wall stuff they do all over the theatre. 

Very psychedelic performance, and an all around fantastic show.  No live music here, but I mean... its the beatles original soundtrack."
Beatles Love,"My fiancee and I have seen this show a couple of times, and it is our favorite one!!  

Creative, fun, great seats anywhere you sit because its in the round.  It is almost better to sit up in the second section to get a birds eye view of the entire production.

When you sit really close, you are constantly turning your head left to right to see everything that is happening.

The roller skaters with big wooly mammoth boots on is my favorite part!

Go see this show!!  Its legit!!"
Beatles Love,"This was my second Cirque show to see (live), having seen O the previous night. They are completely different shows, of course. The focus of the show is obviously the Beatles and their music. The acrobatics are more limited (although there are still impressive things going on), and theres more dancing.

The word that kept popping in my mind while I was watching the performance was cacophony, although I mean it in a good way. The music is almost non-stop and is blasted at full volume. Theres a regular--often constant--activity level. The artists use the whole asterisk-shaped stage--people are coming and going from all points while others are acting something in the center and a few more are swinging through the air. Meanwhile, some sort of stock footage is going by on the giant screens--you know, in case you needed more sensory input. Of course, there are a few songs where they try and give the performers and audience a break and slow it down (like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and Here Comes the Sun), but a lot of the show is loud and busy, with one song leading into the next.

The shape of the stage and the way the performers use it make it kind of delightful for the audience, especially if youre at the end of a row like I was, as you can see the performers coming and going (or coming down the steps past your seat, in one case). Its very in your face (unlike something like O, where its all occurring on a distant stage in front of you).

If you like the Beatles (or are even just OK with them), I highly recommend seeing this. (If you hate the Beatles, STAY AWAY. It will be your own personal hell. :-)) With its energy level, I recommend not going when youre drunk or hungover. Itll be a lot to take in."
Beatles Love,I spent 2 hours in pure amazement.  A great story line with awesome music! I enjoyed that they didnt just play their most popular songs.
Beatles Love,"If youre wondering which show to go to in Vegas, this is the one to watch!!!!!

Im not really a Beatles fan and know only some of the songs that are used in the show, but I truly enjoyed it! The lady right next to me said to me after the show, It was fabulous! And the lady on the other died kept singing the songs during the show!

The first ten minutes made me say WOW! I felt that the first act was worth $125. Oh, and when I got the ticket, I was upgraded! Its because I got it only 40 minutes before the start of the show .

This was my second Cirque show, having watched Quidam in Montréal, and Im definitely a big fan of Cirque du Soleil!"
Beatles Love,My all-time favorite Cirque show ever!! I dont even know that many Beatles songs but the beautiful choreography and presentation brought tears to my eyes. Its such a touching and meaningful story and they managed to utilize the stage and entire theater in the most engaging way. You will leave with a smile on your face and a full heart. I cant recommend this show enough!
Beatles Love,It was much better than I expected.  I have seen this type of show before but it was so diverse that it seemed brands new.  Mixed with Beatles music made it vertu entertaining and actually emotional.  Well worth it.   Check online for discounts and section C seems to be the perfect area to sit.
Beatles Love,"This is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas without a doubt. I have seen this show multiple times and would gladly see it again.

Being a Beatles fan, I really enjoyed how the show incorporated remixed versions of their songs (within you without you, while my guitar gently weeps) and used a great sound system built into the seats to further enhance ones experience in the theater.

Although the show is less acrobatic than others by Cirque, the stunts and dance routines are very entertaining and fit perfectly with soundtrack and visuals on stage.

I highly recommend this show for anyone regardless of your level of interest in the Beatles or Cirque du Soleil."
Beatles Love,"This is truly an amazing show!!! I was not a fan until I actually saw this show randomly in Vegas.

The characters were absolutely fabulous!! I came with a Celeb(So to say) and the Acrobats made a point to say hello and wave after each set which was pretty cool. The music speaks for itself.....ummm its The Beatles!!

I would come and see this show every time I visit Vegas if I could! 

Fabulous!!!!!! Try and buy the soundtrack too!"
Beatles Love,"This show is so much fun! So much energy! The acrobatics are AMAZING! How they put the songs together &amp; made a storyline to it was GENIUS! I would definitely see this show again! I sat in the 3rd row from the stage, I would prefer the next time I go to sit at least 5 rows further back so that I do not have to keep looking up for the high acrobatics, but other than that I have nothing negative to say about the show, with the exception tat they do not allow you take pictures during the show :("
Beatles Love,"This was my 2nd time seeing Love it was just as awesome this time around as it was the 1st if your a fan of the beatles you will absolutely love this show it is by far one of the better Cirque Soleil shows and the music is awesome its a win win, there is no a bad seat in the house"
Beatles Love,"If youre looking for something very entertaining to watch while in Vegas you must check out the Beatles Love show. It had acrobatic acts, dance, and light shows along with the Beatles songs on the background that will surely leave you mesmerized."
Beatles Love,"Stunningly beautiful.

The performers, costumes, music and stage design were all perfect. I sat on the edge of my seat the entire time. 

If youre a Beatles fan, just do yourself a favor: Go see this show, and pay for the floor seats. You wont regret it."
Beatles Love,"Ive been to two Cirque shows in the past, and honestly was a little bored by them. I always totally respected the artistic and acrobatic side of their shows, I just couldnt help but leave a little underwhelmed. Not this time...

Because this is an actual Cirque theater, and not a traveling tent - they can pull off many more stage changes and video screens - and just put an all around better show.

Plus, the Beatles factor was was amazing! The music was awesome, the visual tricks were hypnotizing, and the acrobatics were awe inspiring. I love the Beatles, but think that any music can really help with spicing things up. I think a Led Zeppelin or Jimi show would also be crazy good.

Easily the best Cirque du Soleil Ive ever seen. 5 stars!"
Beatles Love,"Superb show!
Definitely worth the ticket price.

Tip : Get seats further away from the stage (the view is much better)..."
Beatles Love,"Loved Loved Loved this show. If you are a Beatles fan it is a must see. Their isnt much of a story but rather it is a great visualization to go along with some of the best Beatles songs, and the performers were amazing. Its a small theater setting which gives it an intimate feel. My only complaint is I wish I had time to see it again."
Beatles Love,"Be still, my heart! What a breathtaking show! 

Saw this show with my SO early in the year and sat towards the back. I highly recommend higher seats as, with most Cirque shows, they utilize the full stage and surrounding areas. If you have a closer seat, the harder it is to see everything going on. 

Cirque doesnt disappoint with this show. I like it even more for all the metaphor and implicit symbolism they used throughout the story told. Sigh, I heard a great many others after the show who complained of falling asleep and didnt get it. Read up on the story of The Beatles, and watch the show with an open mind... the little allusions are treats to discover as you watch them perform. I wanted to watch it again just to find the references I didnt catch the first time.

Love, love, loved LOVE!"
Beatles Love,"I love cirque performances. I watched Worlds Apart multiple times, and visited a couple of shows both at home and in Vegas. However, I felt this show was a bit lacking. Dont get me wrong, the show alone is a good show...but compared to their other shows, it just didnt stand out for me. Its mostly dancing...I was expecting mostly an acrobatic show full of wow...but even the acrobatics were mild in comparison to other shows.Dancing shows are fine and all, I dont mind it. But their timing was off and almost sloppy during this particular performance (people falling behind the rest of the group, people forgetting moves, etc). I loved the special effects and lighting...I loved all the audience participation. The music was great. There were laughable moments. I did enjoy myself, but I feel the price wasnt worth it. There were about 3 or 4 performances I truly enjoyed, the rest was just kinda blah."
Beatles Love,"Love is my second favorite Cirque show that Ive seen so far. 

Im a semi fan of the Beatles but Im not of the right generation to be Beatles crazy.  When I was born,  Lenon had already left us and the Beatles played on the Oldies stations my parents listened to.   That being said I didnt get all of the political and historical references that showed up during this show and I had to interview my parents to get a couple aspects.   I knew many of the songs and I loved that they were there, experienced a few lesser known to me songs but the show was also visually stunning,  had a great story and was full of excitement.  Not all the cirque acts make sense in every show Ive seen but the story in Love is very well done.  I cant think of an act or dance that didnt fit the beautiful journey through their music and lives.  I loved the use of technology that actually brought the Beatles to the stage mixing them into their own story as told by dancers, costumes and acrobats.   

I know the surviving members and the families were very creatively involved and I believe it.  The show is uniquely Beatles and uniquely Cirque all at once which is a pretty amazing feat to bring those two together so beautifully. 

As much as I loved this show,  my parents loved it more because they were big fans back in the day.   So if youre a fan, its a must see and if you arent a fan (baring a hatred of the music or story) then its still highly recommended. 

For seating - I dont think there is a bad seat in the house and wouldnt necessarily pay top price for tickets.  This show is very well suited for the round stage and everything important is repeated so all can see.   If you have to be in great seats then go for it, but you can cheap out a bit here if you want or need to."
Beatles Love,"Got these tickets at 1/2 price tickets in the AM.  They have booths around the stripe.

Got the tickets and then went to Mirage boxoffice to reserve seats immediately. 

Original seating price $139. 
Got it at 1/2 price tickets for $93. 

Print out $2.00 coupon too!

I think O was more mesmerizing but overall it was good show. I wished I brushed up on Beatles songs beforehand.

No center stage; but it is a circular stage."
Beatles Love,"Being a fan of both The Beatles and Cirque du Soleil, it only made sense that I check out LOVE. I was very happy I did, so much so that Ive seen it once more since.

Based on suggestions by previous viewers, both times I chose to sit higher up, so that I would be further back and can take it everything that was happening without being distracted by what was directly in front of me. With so much going on, I realized quite quickly that they were on to something and that I had made the right decision.

Amazing costumes, a remastered collection of The Beatles music, and beautiful choreography makes this a must watch show in Las Vegas."
Beatles Love,LOVED IT!!!! got awesome discounted tickets through travelzoo! Loved our seats. I think the higher your seat is the better you appreciate the show. LOVED the audio.
Beatles Love,"So many Cirque shows in Vegas, I chose this one due to being familiar with Beatles songs. I didnt want to be forced watching Cirque Du So Gay with half naked men prancing around balancing on each others crotches, I wanted to see Beatles Songs playing in the background of  half naked men prancing around balancing on each others crotches.

At $360 for two tickets, I was glad I chose this show for spending so much. The segues from song to song, and circus act to circus act is amazing. I am still trying to get over how fast they change stage sets.

Everyone knows Beatles songs, so I figure if you are going to spend this much on a show, go have your mind blown by this sensory overload.

Oh, and skip on the Big Gulp sized cocktail or beer. Youll be holding your pee for at least an hour and forty-five minutes."
Beatles Love,"is you like the Beatles dont just sit there  RUN
it was great better then stupid peepshow with coco lol
even though the tickets were comped i would have paid 
make sure you get the right seats here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
as i was warned thank god i took their advice    closer is not always better 
there is so much action its over whelming up close you wont see more then 65% of the show   you have to sit up a bit and slightly angled.
Im 33 years old i really wasnt a part of the Beatles era but i felt as though i was a part of it. I will have to back again!      also sometimes locals can get half off pricing which is a good thing if your in vegas as often as i am and well you know locals 
god save the queen ?!?  haha"
Beatles Love,"Some of my friends will hate me for this, but I just didnt find this one as good as my other cirque experience. As much as I love the Beatles and their music, there was no story line. Which I understand, its a Beatles tribute and hard to put a story together based on their songs. But I guess I dont deal well with the abstract. I went in a group of 5 and some loved it, while others thought it was okay. I personally would have preferred more acrobats and less dancing, and maybe I would have liked it more if it had been my first cirque show. Who knows. A good show, but not sure it was worth my $123."
Beatles Love,"This was a FANTASTIC show!
Get seats on the lower level if you can.  The experience will be different. 
My parents enjoyed this performance immensely as well.  Id give it more than 5 stars if I could."
Beatles Love,"I mean, its five stars. No getting around that.

Im not the biggest Beatles fan, but this show absolutely destroyed. I did have the MOST flamboyant man ever in front of me belting out songs showtune style, and I almost pissed myself laughing so hard. We were talking before the show and I did NOT see that coming! 

Like all other Cirque shows, it would be better on shrooms. But if everyone showed up on shrooms, someone would probably get seriously injured every show . Think about it. Hundreds of people on shrooms in the same room as a Cirque set. I cant even fathom it. Horror film or comedy?

This review is terrible. I give the show five stars because its awesome, and I give my own review a rating of kill myself."
Beatles Love,"LOVE is amazing!!! 

Prior to watching this Cirque du Soleil production at The Mirage last week, I had never been a big fan of the Beatles. I respected their music and who they were as artists. After watching this show, I am a  huge fan. The great choreography and story line brought the music alive. This was my second Cirque du Soleil show and they never disappoint! The 360 around stage ensures everyone in the audience gets a great view of the show.

Seats range from $75- 250. For your money, this show definitely satisfies! If your in Vegas, see this show!"
Beatles Love,"Not my favorite show.  Was well done as always.  Pretty busy stage, almost appeared to be over done.  I left thinking, what was the point of that? Seen many more Cirque shows, all were better shows, the quality of the show is the same, great artists.  If you are a die hard Beatles fan, Im sure you will love it."
Beatles Love,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. It was seriously mind blowing and not to sound too dramatic, but it was almost life changing. This show was gorgeous and absolutely spectacular. If you do anything at all in Vegas, make sure it is this-- you will not regret it!"
Beatles Love,"The Cirque people know how to put on a good show and if you are a Beatles fan you will enjoy this presentation. The music sounds amazing. The cast is energetic and you will have a hard time knowing what to look at because there is just so much to see. There are some very moving moments in the show - Ive seen it twice and loved both performances. 

Now lets talk about the problem. The Cirque security team, ushers, bouncers and the like are all poorly-trained, power-hungry, Paul Blart Mall Cop types. Another way to describe them is thuggish. They were rude to me and my guest both times I went to the show. If you go to the early show they really want to rush you out of there quickly. I was trying to buy gifts in the gift shop when some ape steps in front of me and ropes off the back entrance. He says I have to move on. I asked him if I could simply cross the rope that 10 seconds ago wasnt there. He put his hand in my chest and said no - it was for my own safety. What he really meant was This is MY power. This is my chance to pretend I am somebody and I get to tell you what to do. It was silly, unnecessary and downright off-putting. I wasnt drunk (hadnt had one drink,) I was dressed in a suit and tie, I wasnt causing trouble but was run out of there (like anyone else who had the bad luck to be trying to spend money in the gift shop) like I was a deadbeat. I wont be back. Ever. 

If you want to go visit the gift shop, my advice is go before the show. And watch out for the so-called security. Its easy to spot them - they are the typical wannabe cops that couldnt get a job with Metro so they play Barney Fife at the Cirque show and pretend they are bad-asses. 

If you do go to the early show do some workouts the week before you go. Then prepare to do some wind sprints down the hallway the second the show is over because they WILL run you out of there like it or not - and they wont be polite about it."
Beatles Love,This is a great show the only thing keeping it from a fifth star is the price.  They do have some bad seats as well so look out for that.  It is a great show and I was more into it than I thought I would be.  Good for the kids if you can afford to take them.
Beatles Love,"Another great cirque show.

Production was great.  Sound quality was very good.  A cool lighting effect with lots of lights on strings hanging down.

Acrobatics, dance, music all very well done!  Sometimes there is so much going on its hard to take it all in. No need to buy the most expensive seats, mid level seats seemed just fine to me."
Beatles Love,"I have never been a major fan of The Beatles, I have saved that obsession for my parents and my younger sister.  So when my mother-in-law bought us tickets to this show I was like I dunno....
O.M.G.
We had amazing seats, third row.  I have no idea what all happened, if it had a deeper meaning or it was just art or what, but it was UNREAL.  Be prepared to have your whole body messed with during this show-- a complete sensory experience-- there are speakers on the seats in front of you, different smells in the air and about five million things to see, and even some things to touch.  Your eyeballs will be bouncing around the first 10-15 minutes, unsure of where to go, but just sit back and take it all in.
It is amazing.  
You dont have to be a Beatles fan to enjoy it.  But be ready to be a fan when you leave."
Beatles Love,Wow I am really disappointed in the changes that were made.  This was my 3rd time seeing this show and definitely my least favorite of the times with the changes made.   It looks like they took out some a chunk of the acrobatics and put in props.  Not as much or as difficult acrobatics.  I brought a friend who is a Beattles fanatic and he liked it but I wish he had seen the old version. It is much better. I would give it a solid 4.
Beatles Love,"For all the Beatles fans, this place makes it most exciting! The Cirque group have done a fantastic job integrating a show, music, lighting, costumes. We even got upgraded to front row seats when I took the in laws in town, talk about awesomeness, I guess it was a slow night on Sunday."
Beatles Love,First Cirque du Soleil and it was free...there are no bad seats just an amazing performance!!!
Beatles Love,"AMAZING. WORTH EVERY PENNY. If you are in Vegas and looking for a show to go see LOVE needs to be on the top of your list.

Stop reading this review and buy tickets. Thank me later"
Beatles Love,"When Im in Vegas I like to do three things: Eat, Drink, and Gamble. I know that Vegas is known for their great shows but Id rather spend my money on other things, such as stuffing my face and getting drunk. 

But when I went here with my sister, aunt, and Grandmother, I knew I was going to have to spend at least one night at a show. 

Oh Man was I happy we chose this one! Love was awesome!!! I had such a good time. You dont need to be a HUGE Beatles fan to love this show. My aunt doesnt like the Beatles that much and she adored this show. 

If youre going to go to only one show in Vegas, this should be it!"
Beatles Love,"A truly amazing performance- this is without question a must see Las Vegas show!

If youve been doing your homework and studying Yelp for your upcoming Las Vegas vacation, youve probably read through several different Cirque shows by now. Its true that every Cirque show is different- KA is very intense, Zumanity is very sexual, and The Beatles show? The best way to describe The Beatles Cirque show is a non stop party- eye popping entertainment- action all over the stage at all times- a splash of audience participation and a whole lot PEACE and LOVE!

All of the characters are filled with life, the scenes are energetic and alive, and youll be singing along with the Beatles songs all night long.

I dont want to spoil any of the show for you, but I assure you this is one of the best Cirques in town. I advise you to purchase tickets from Tix4Tonight or straight from the Mirage the day of the show. I purchased great seats in section 104 for 35% off the day of the show, and it was totally worth it- just ask them if they have discounted seats available! And I promise you, there is NO BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE, the balcony seats will still provide amazingly close views of the stage.   

If anyone out there is reading this and has any questions before purchasing tickets for their Vegas vacation feel free to ask me! I loved this show very much and couldnt give it anything less than 5 stars."
Beatles Love,Well for starters I am not a big fan of the Beatles (Yes we do exist) so I was not really looking forward to this. We had reasonable seats and the venue is quite large and with stage being 360 and they way main stage is set it is possible to miss out somethings. Cirque tried to cover it with something going on each side but I found it to be a sensory overload. The soundtrack is good as it is a take on legendary music here. The acrobats are ok but not amazing like other shows. My friend enjoyed it but I wasnt impressed so my take is if you are a Beatles fan by all means go for it but if you are Cirque fan there are much better options.
Beatles Love,"Lets start out by saying that I am not a Beatles fan.  There are a handful of songs that I like but never got into them.  I tend to like the folk portion of that era of music. And you know what it did not matter one bit.  It was a fun high energy show that should make anyone smile. 

My husband who likes the Beatles less than I do can wait to take the girls."
Beatles Love,This was my 3rd Cirque show and I have to say it was the best so far. Being a product of the sixties I have to say it brought back a lot of fond memories
Beatles Love,"worst show in las vegas. dont waste your money in
 this show. its just a boring busy musical. go to see zumanity, youll have a great time."
Beatles Love,"The only reason that Im giving Love a 3 star rating is because in comparison to the other Cirque shows that Ive seen, it was just ok.  I thought Mystere was a million times better and cheaper.

Despite that, I still happily danced and bounced around in my seat the entire 90 minutes.  There is a great energy to this show, its fun!  However, if you arent a big fan of The Beatles, you might not be a big fan of Love.

One cool thing about the sound system in the theater is that there are actually three speakers installed in each seat.  One of which is in your headrest.  During one of the songs, I literally thought homeslice behind me was singing along but really it was just the background vocalist.  I may or may not have turned around twice to shush him.

Before buying your tickets, make sure that Tix 4 Tonight is not selling them.  We got ours for 40% off."
Beatles Love,"Seats do not matter in this small, intimate auditorium.  See it all from the balcony/less expensive seats or get intimate with more expensive seats."
Beatles Love,I have seen numerous Cirque shows and after awhile you feel like if youve seen one youve seen them all.  The acts were the same basic Cirque acts but the show itself was drastically different.  I felt like the who show was produced by someone on acid who followed the lyrics of the songs a little too literally.  My aunt loved it and wondered if I couldnt appreciate it as much because Im too young.
Beatles Love,"Not the BIGGEST Beatles fan....that being said, the show was still AMAZING!!!
~Very COLORFUL 
~Beautiful costume work
~I cant believe that Im going to say this but....we sat front row and felt like I was TOO close.  I wish that we had been a few rows back because being that close meant that we were BELOW the stage and had to keep our heads at a strange angle the entire time.  Besides that, we were on the FAR end of the stage, so we were really only able to see what was happening on our side of the stage.  BUMMER.
~A do recommend...........as long as you take into account the seating issue.  I had free tickets, I wouldnt want anyone else to feel like it was wasted money because they missed parts of the show."
Beatles Love,"Ive heard a lot of good reviews about this CDS, including a great one from a close co-worker; so I decided WTH, why not? I waited til it went on sale, so I got a pretty good deal for pretty awesome seats.

I can see why Beattles Lovers would enjoy this show; the music was excellent, and the theatric was incredibly lively. The props and backdrops were amazing. There were so much efforts and thoughts put into this show.

With all that being said, I gave this show a 3-star because Im simply just not a musical person. They last thing I would want to sit through is a musical of any sorts. So in that respect, I am bias."
Beatles Love,"I may be biased because I LOVE the Beatles but I thought it was amazing! 

Great visual effects! Very creative! Outstanding performances!

We watched the 9:30 pm Monday showing and it was packed.

-There is a snack bar which sells food and beverages both non-alcoholic/ alcoholic
-There is a retail shop where you can buy souvenirs as well as a lot of other Beatles stuff.

Suggestions:

-I think its best to not sit in the front row!!! Not even in the lower section. The middle section allows you to see the whole arena. 

We sat in section 207 row O which was perfect because the restroom was right up the stairs, also we were in the perfect position to fully experience certain special effects.

-Make sure you arrive at least 30 minutes before the show. If you arrive late, they make you wait until there is an appropriate time for you to enter.

Restrooms: Men and Women restroom near our section. There were 3 stalls in the womens bathroom. The line can get pretty long right before the show starts.
  

I actually loved it so much I want to go again so I can catch the things I missed!"
Beatles Love,"I didnt get it!  As a fan of Beatles music (who isnt?) and never having seen a Cirque Du Soleil show, I was really excited to see the show.  The music and the sound system was great.  Some of the stunts were pretty cool, but not gaspworthy.  But I just had no clue what was going on!  Lots of people jumping around doing tricks but no story or anything to keep you interested other than waiting to hear what the next song would be.

As I watched I wondered why I wasnt loving it and thought maybe it was just me, but as I looked around the theater it looked like everyone was bored to death!  The lady next to me slept through most of it.  Nobody was cheering other than some polite applause.  I felt bad for the performers who were obviously talented and working hard, but it felt like someone planted an audience of corpses as a practical joke on the performers!  After the show, there was no buzz, just a few thousand silent people mulling over all they could have otherwise done with their $150 or so per head. 

We sat pretty high in the theater, which is pretty small.  Those seats were excellent.

The previous night we saw Raiding the Rock Vault at LVH.  It was GREAT!!!!  If you like classic rock you should definitely look into seeing that excellent fun show!"
Beatles Love,This show was fine. I am beginning to think that there are just too many Cirque shows in LV. I was hoping for more from this show. It was mildly entertaining. I wouldnt recommend it unless you were able to get discount tix. The parachute they role over the crowd was pretty fun and the dudes on roller blades were pretty awesome.
Beatles Love,"I am trying to figure out why this show is so highly rated and for the life of me, I cant understand why there are so many 5 star ratings.

The funny thing is that most of the people who give the show 5 stars are not Beatles fans!  If youre not a Beatles fan, maybe youve never really been exposed to the music before.  I am a big Cirque fan and a HUGE Beatles fan.  I can recite every lyric from every Beatles song as well as tell you what album and track any song is from.  I already know Beatles music is great.  Maybe thats why I was so disappointed by the show.

To me it just seemed like a bunch of people jumping up and down to the rhythm of Beatles music.  They were literally bouncing up and down on trampolines to Beatles songs.  There was too much of too little going on at the same time -- it all seemed a bit disorganized and schizophrenic (perhaps they were just trying to make the audience feel like they were on acid?).

When I walk away from a Cirque show, I usually grab my friends and say, Can you believe the guys who did X?  Werent the girls who did Y amazing?  Cirque shows are supposed to be about acrobats pushing the envelope of what the human body can do.  Its hard for me to get excited about people bouncing up and down.

I can name 5 jaw-dropping feats from O.  I can name 5 eye-rubbing feats from Mystere.  I loved the Chinese Diabolo (yo-yo) girls from Quidam.  What do I remember about LOVE?  There was one cool thing that they did with a Transformer-like VW Bug, although there was nothing acrobatic about it.  They also ran a giant tarp over the entire audience that got sucked up by a vacuum cleaner or something -- interesting to watch, but I remember doing the same thing playing parachute in elementary school.

I dont like being the only person with bad things to say about this show, but there you have it.  The show is a good introduction to the music if youve never really been a Beatles fan, but I think if youre already a fan, the dancing is just a distraction.  Like I said, I am a big Cirque fan and a big Beatles fan, but I dont think the world needed a combination of the two...To me, its kinda like the episode of 30 Rock where Tracy Morgan tried to combine video games and porn."
Beatles Love,All I can say was this blew my mind. After a lack of fulfilling Vegas shows this was out of this world. Very courteous ticket staff and the show.....definitely the most creative Vegas experience Ive had yet. Perfect for all ages an the music is always sweetness to my ears.
Beatles Love,"My wife, son and I were really amazed by this show. Very imaginative, creative and inspired. The setting for each song was spot-on and it captured the energy and vibe of the Beatles songs perfectly. For a die-hard Beatles fan like myself, I worried about a cheese factor - not there. Even if you only like a few Beatles tunes, youll enjoy this presentation (sonic mash-ups of their recorded catalog). Its a psychedelic circus for the eyes and packs an emotional wallop too. Really great. 

Highlights - Something, A Day in the Life, Eleanor Rigby, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
Beatles Love,"I recommend everyone sees this show for the spectacular visuals that I will never forget.  However, I must admit to being a bit disappointed with my first Vegas Cirque show, having seen four previous shows in Los Angeles.  For every spectacular visually stunning number there were a few that were kind of boring, just many costumed people dancing around on the stage.  I wasnt sure to look to find the great acrobatics I was expected but often times there werent any.  Thats right...far less acrobatics than Ive come to expect from smaller Cirque shows.  

Yes, there were two very good numbers in the middle of the show (one with unicycles flying) but that turned out to be the climax of thrills.  After that it was back to amazing visuals and a lot of wandering around onstage.  The attempt at a story was unfortunate.  Better to skip storytelling than attempt it so poorly.

If you like the Beatles, see this.  Everyone else can skip it.  Amazing visuals, great theatricality, but not much drama."
Beatles Love,"I was treated to this show for my birthday and was pleasantly surprised!
We sat near the front, some may argue that these are not the best seats, but I disagree, totally worth it!  I dont think this would appropriately compare to sitting in the front row at a movie theater staring up the entire time.  There are things going on everywhere, next to you, up in the air and on stage.  I was comfortable and enjoyed my view.

The show complements the music so well and you are entertained.  If you like The Beatles you will love this show. 

Its amazing!"
Beatles Love,"This is my fourth Cirque show, Ive seen Saltimbanco, Alegria &amp; one of my favorites, Mystere.  I bought six tickets for half price but I was a bit worried after I heard it didnt have as much high acrobatics as Mystere.  

We picked up our tickets about 45 minutes before show time, took a peek into the shop, then took our seats about 15 minutes before while some of our party went to buy snacks.  Note: there are a LOT of stairs in this theater!  An elderly couple whose seats were down close to the stage didnt want to walk all the way down there so they traded seats with a couple in our group.  

O. M. G. !  I absolutely LOVE(D) this show!  

We were seated about one third of the way up and as mentioned by other reviewers, all seats have a great view!  They have speakers in the head rest, but the volume is perfectly balanced as not to blast your ears, its quite subtle.  The music and visuals left me smiling and singing to myself, it was euphoric!  Even my elderly mother enjoyed it and shes not even a Beatles fan!  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was stunningly beautiful!  And listening to Revolution brought me back to grade school when I played our 45 rpm record of it over and over and over!  The performers were great (as usual), the enhanced musical arrangements were great and the visuals were surreal, stunning &amp; creative!   An excellent Cirque show that I would LOVE to see again!  

That said, the crowd to get out of the venue was crazy!  Like cattle...mooo!   We stopped into the souvenir shop where they offered some really nice shirts, CDs, posters, bags and other memorabilia.  Of course they were pricy but lucky for me the shirt I liked was on sale!"
Beatles Love,"LOVE is my first Cirque de Soleil experience so I have nothing else to compare it to but this show was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen! My husband &amp; I went last month &amp; we were both blown away. We decided to purchase some of the more expensive tickets but all the seats are awesome. The show takes up so much space &amp; the auditorium isnt big enough to have a bad seat. I am a hue Beatles fan which is what motivated me to choose this show over other Cirque de Soileil acts &amp;  was so impressed. I think my love for the Beatles just made me appreciate it that much more! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Beatles or Cirque de Soileil or both. You will be gripped from the start! Good for the Mirage, because they have something spectacular with this one! It was so much fun &amp; worth every penny."
Beatles Love,Love the stage.  I dont think there was a bad seat in the house!  Just the entrance alone to the theater was amazing.
Beatles Love,My BF asked me if I wanted to go see a show while in Vegas. This was my first ever Cirque Du Soleil show and I like the Beatles - so why not? Its hard not to be impressed with people who fly around on a stage. The athletic ability and talent that is showcased all to the Beatles was nothing short of awesome. I think Lucy in the Sky was one of my favorite parts of the whole show (though there really were a lot of great moment throughout the show). Though this is my first show - it certainly wont be my last.
Beatles Love,"Good music, but for a Cirque show, I really expected more acrobatics, visual effects, and stunts.  Appreciated the dancing, but during the entire show it felt like i was waiting for something more to happen, then after a couple hours, it ended.  Disappointing."
Beatles Love,Absolutely loved the show.  We were in row r. Seats were great.  View was great. The show seemed to play to all the seats. So it didnt seem like any seats were left out.
Beatles Love,"ive watched all the cirque shows and this was my least favorite....and i still gave it 4 stars.  im not a huge beatles fan... 

i think we had the best seats in the house.  we sat on the second section above the orchestra... we were eye level with the performers...if we sat in the first couple of rows,we would be looking up the whole time.

i would watch all the shows again, except for this one.... the songs were getting annoying after a while."
Beatles Love,"I was collecting Beatles memorabilia when I hit sixth grade, so this was  a no brainer for our Vegas trip. Id heard it was the best of the Cirque du Soleil offerings. Comfortable seats, phenomenal acoustics, and completely immersive. My imagination grew ten sizes in one viewing of Beatles LOVE.

Its a staggering show, brought me to tears in the first act and held our group captivated for the whole 90 minutes. Ushers are dressed in Sgt. Peppers and Rita Meter Maid outfits. As you relax into the auditorium, a tall, bald man with a white suite strolls around, tipping a teapot of dry ice smoke throughout the audience. A few characters gather and then the music starts. Within minutes, acrobats have descended, confetti fills the air, and the stage unfolds to reveal a Liverpool cityscape. The setting changes with each number as brick facades, human-sized birdcages, three-dimensional art, a pieced together Volkswagen (just to name a few) repopulate the stage. There are trampolines, skater, acrobats, and aerialists with no end of talent and energy. The elaborate choreography will leave you wanting another viewing."
Beatles Love,"LOVE embraces your inner hippie and lets loose your oppressed rebel  using music from the Beatles, visual projections and world class acrobatic talent. For Beatles fans and non-fans alike, the show reflects our nations youth across a few decades.

- Remastered music.
- Talented cast.
- Well thought out integration of music and visuals.
- Expensive for front row.
- Comfortable seats.

While on a memorial trip to Vegas with my wife and uncle, Cirque du Soleil makes a sure bet for a memorable trip. I have seen many Cirque du Soleil shows in the past and they all differ in their own way. LOVE helped bring back some Beatles nostalgia for my uncle and provided a unique performance for the audience.

Sitting in the front row is a good idea 90% of the time with Cirque du Soleil shows and worked out well in this case. I scored the tickets from the fan club, well under the going rate and it amplified the experience being so close. Characters practically sit on your lap and do front-flips like youre the only person in the audience.

With Cirque du Soleil LOVE, the audience honors the musical legacy of the Beatles through remastered recordings, special visits from the iconic band members, and fictional characters pulled right from the songs.Youll find yourself watching Sgt. Pepper who encounters many familiar faces, including Lucy in the Sky, Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna and Mr. Kite. 

The unconstrained story of the Beatles starts at the Blitz, moves through the bands founding, climb into superstardom, and their break-up. Using the master tapes at Abbey Road studios, they have created a unique soundscape of The Beatles music for LOVE. With panoramic sound and visuals, the audience will experience The Beatles as never before."
Beatles Love,"Many says that you dont need any knowledge of Beatles to enjoy the show.   I kind of disagree.  This is a show about Beatless music and their history, and it follows a semi-storyline.  If you have no idea of the context of the song, you will just see whole bunch of very good dancers with pretty costumes running around.

Another thing is that the theater does have bad seats.  I would say 85% of them are good seats but the 15% that is at the side of the big curtain, (the theater has one big curtain and two small ones) they will have problems seeing 100% of the show.  So, avoid the cheapest seat and opt for the closer seats. (Avoid sections 203, 204, 205 and 206 if you can.) 

If you do not know Beatles, go to youtube and search for the Love production video before buying the tickets.  This will give you pretty good idea on what you are getting so you wont regret it later."
Beatles Love,"200th review!  Here we go!  I figured since I did #100 on Cirque du Soleils KA, might as well do #200 on LOVE.  Its kind of a long overdue review (June 2008), but its still fresh in mind.  I remember how stoked I was to see this show!  This was coming from a point where I jumped on the Beatles bandwagon after watching Across The Universe.  I loved the songs they used in the film so after watching that, I knew that I was going to watch LOVE for my next Cirque show.

So for a whopping $165, I managed to score 3rd row seats.  It was really up close and personal with the performers!  Literally!  There was one part of the show where a performer flew at our section and the lady beside me hella screamed, LOL!!  The music selection was great and I loved the parts with the Beatles silhouettes.  There were many moments in the show where I would be head bopping to the music and even singing along too.

LOVE isnt really for everyone expecting the crazy acrobatics and circus acts like in Mystere and KA, but its more like a musical experience with the Beatles.  It purely is a show for the fans, but even if youre not a Beatles fan, I think youll like it for the performances.

Although I paid I huge premium for this show, I would definitely see it again.

Overall AMAZING show! 5 stars!!!"
Beatles Love,"If you havent read fellow yelper Seth Ys review please do so immediately. Ok, now where was I? If you havent seen this show yet fear not, you are only missing one of the best Cirque shows in Vegas. As many others pointed out this show would be about 100 times more entertaining with a bit of  ::ear muffs kids:: recreation drug use ::ok, were good::

Coincidentally I was sober when I saw this show and I still thought it was fucking amazing. The Beatles music in surround sound was fantastic and the acrobatics and lights added to the overall enjoyment of the show. What the hell are you waiting for?"
Beatles Love,"Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and youre gone...

If youre a Beatles fan, this Cirque production is pure pleasure.  Its got some monster hits, as well as a few lesser known tunes.  Even a non-die hard fan (like my wife, for whom The Beatles is some bank on the oldie radio station) will be hard pressed to find fault with this show.  

The thing that surprised me, however, was the lack of acrobatics or physical feats Cirque has come to be recognized for.  It really is more like a musical, and less the high flying stunt work of Mystere.  Seems a lot of reviews say this, but I guess were all guilty of (gasp!) not Yelping this before shelling out some green.  Regardless, this is pure entertainment that brought The Beatles to life for those of us who didnt get to grow up with them."
Beatles Love,"I am a Cirque du Soleil enthusiast and have seen most of their shows. This one was unbelievable, one of their best!!! Yes it plays Beatles music and the dancing/acts are put in context with their songs, but it is so much more than a Beatles show. The lighting, sound, aerial acts, stage movements, clever use of draping, cool minimalist sets - everything is exquisite and very well executed! It was so good that we wanted to catch the second show of the night right after we watched the first one :D Go see it!"
Beatles Love,"If you see this show and at no point you find yourself filled with child-like wonder, you have no soul. This was incredible. You know how people say things are awesome and they really arent awesome, its just people overusing the word awesome? This show is ACTUALLY full on awesome. It takes the human experience we all share of those weird dreams that make no sense and then taps into it to make it a shared and live experience for everyone. They somehow manage to bend reality and not in a half-assed kind of way. Its reality bent and twisted into a surreal experience capturing the essence of every Beatles song played. This was my first Cirque show and I hope they are all this fantastic."
Beatles Love,"I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! Just watched it last night, and I just cant get it off of my mind. My husband and I sat on the third row, and it was so much worth it. So heart throwbing and capturing that it made me tear up by its performance. Although, my husband wasnt a Beatles fan, he defined it an adrenaling experience of music and art. Seriously, I highly recommend this to everyone to watch it."
Beatles Love,"Oh wow. LOVE is one of the most enchanting shows Ive seen in my life. You know that feeling when you are giddy like a child and your eyes are big and you cant help but smile? Yep, that was me for the entire span of LOVE.

I am a huge fan of The Beatles, but even if you arent I think that this is a performance you would enjoy at any age. When Sir Nicholas and I left the show we asked each other our favorite parts and truth be told it was hard to name the ones we like best because we liked them all. But, we managed to narrow down some highlights and Ill put them here for you. If youve never seen LOVE and dont like things ruined for you dont read any further...

Nick loved two parts best, one was a reoccurring theme of VW Beatles that ended with one actually made of different parts on handles with performers holding each piece inside the vehicle. At one point the car breaks apart and all these dancers spill out using a wheel hub or hood as an accessory for their act. It was quick charming. The other part was a trampoline set where there were four trampolines in the floor and the performers used them along with nets and a big red English phone booth to do the most amazing acrobatic acts.

While I liked both of those acts, too I thought that a foursome on roller skate (Maybe roller blades? I dont know because I couldnt see the wheels thanks to their shaggy white boot covers.) that used ramps to do their tricks was amazing. They were all perfectly in sync with hitting the highs in the air and on their tricks. 

But, for the song that stole the show when put together with the act Id have to say Lucy in the Sky was the hands down winner for me. This started with a giant sheet covering the entire audience that reminded me of being in elementary gym class. They withdrew the white covering and the entire theater looked light we were out in the night sky, but a trippy version. Then a lovely red headed girl along with accompanying aerialists performed their act that seemed to showcase the song beautifully.

The tickets range from $100 - $150 for performance I think and this is one show where I say the $150 is worth it. Its a memory that likely wont soon fade, especially if youve ever liked any Beatles tune at all."
Beatles Love,"I am not a huge Beatles fan and even less so of Cirque du Soleil.  They freak me out (the clowns  -  not the Beatles). Its just too much for my little head to process all that jumping about and audience participation. Ugh, I hate participating! But the tickets were a gift and so we went. 

Be prepared for a lot of people singing along. Heck, you might be one of them. If you really love the Beatles, you will love this show. If you really like the weird clowns, you might be disappointed. But I thought it was entertaining, the music was great, the clowns not too Cirque du Soleil-y (you know what I mean? All that grunting &amp; bouncing &amp; creepy bending!) so there wasnt so much jumping about that I almost had a seizure. If youre claustrophobic, dont sit to close to the stage, though."
Beatles Love,"Im sorry to say, but this was THE worst Cirque show Ive seen despite being a Beatles fan.  I was extremely disappointed with the lack of acrobatics in the show.  When watching a Cirque show, theres a certain amount of WOW factor you expect.  Unfortunately, the WOW did not deliver since a good 70% of the show is just people dancing around.  Dont get me wrong, I love dancing and watching people dance, but just not at a Cirque production for nearly $100. 

P.S. A kid (maybe 10 years old) was sitting in front of me and was so bored that he started entertaining himself with his PSP for 30 minutes until a staff member annoyingly flashed an extremely bright light at him to stop."
Beatles Love,"The best Cirue du Soleil show ever!  I had lots of fun at the show, it was GREAT!

I got $55 tickets and they were just fine.  There is not a bad seat in the house.

I will be going again :-D"
Beatles Love,"I loved this show! It was interesting to see how they interpreted some of the songs. We were entertained from the time we walked in to the time we walked out. This was my first live Cirque Du Soleil show so I was in awe the whole time. Sometimes there was sooooo much going on at once, my eyes did not know where to look, lol."
Beatles Love,Im giving it a 1 star but you may not all agree with that. If your a beetles fan you may love it. Other wise its a vomit of color and repetitive flips with annoying music that has long since been outdated. Yes Im sorry hipsters but we all have to admit that the beetles arent as good as you claim they are. maybe in our parents generation. So if you a beetles fan or a hipster that pretends to be one go you may like it. If you are not STAY AWAY!!
Beatles Love,"I love the beatles, but I really dont care for shows.  Im glad I ended up going because it was amazing. I dont want to give too much away, so just go!"
Beatles Love,"You will either love it or hate it.
If you love The Beatles, you probably wont  mind spending $110 to experience the music via visual interpretation.

 If you are KINDA a fan, you may fall asleep.  Its not death defying acrobatics, but it is entertainment. 

If you want naked people or something that will knock your socks off, head elsewhere. 

Needless to say, I enjoyed myself very much. I was moved, touched, and at some points choked up. I was a little worried when I sat in my nosebleed seats.  Luckily, there is no  bad seat in the house...and the bed transformation is visible from everywhere. ACES."
Beatles Love,"One word: Incredible.

Just saw this for the second time (first time close-up and this time way up in the balcony).  I have to say, anywhere you sit is an engaging and enjoyable experience.

Truly worth the money."
Beatles Love,"Amazing and beautiful to witness.   Sat pretty high up, but the seats were still great.  The sound is effing amazing - I dont know if Ive ever heard the Beatles sound this good.
After the show, be sure to check out the Beatles lounge, which is a Beatles-themed bar that only plays Beatles songs - except at 10 p.m., it turns into a gay non-Beatles bar..."
Beatles Love,"I love Cirque du Soleil, and Ive always been inspired by the Beatles music, so Ive been wanting to see this show for a long time.  Finally, I took my girl to go see it with me.

We loved it!  The music was, of course, the highlight of the evening (the Beatles music never sounded better), but as always with Cirque du Soleil the performance art was fantastic as well.  

I cant say I liked it more than Mystére, but I enjoyed it just as much, and I cant recommend it more highly."
Beatles Love,"We saw this show last month by taking advantage of the Summer of Cirque offer for $55 tickets. The showroom is great, and there is an awful lot going on all the time during the performance. I think I could see it again more than once and get something new from it each time. My partner isnt a Beatles fan, but he still thoroughly enjoyed it.

This is a great show for all ages, and definitely worth it at $55."
Beatles Love,"Not your typical Cirque du Soleil show.  It was good but it didnt have as many acrobatics as I had seen in other CDS shows.  I appreciated the artistry &amp; imagination of the show but honestly I was a little bored.  My husband, 3 kids &amp; I saw Zarkana a few days ago &amp; thought it was awesome, a 10 out of 10.  I would give Love a 6 out of 10.  I was disappointed &amp; wouldnt recommend Love."
Beatles Love,"I Loved Love.

Thanks to my old man, I worshiped the Beatles. I know every single song they have ever composed, sung, and performed together as a group.

I also love to dance (as many of you know). 

So this show was TOTALLY  made and designed for me. 

If you expect and desire amazing acrobats, New Age garbage music, and OMFG special effects, this is NOT your show. 

I would recommend this show to those who are Beatles die-hards (such as myself) and enjoy many elements of dancing (hip hop, ballet, street, tap, etc.).

The interpretations of the Beatles songs were beautiful, tasteful, and best of all, artful. To be honest, I can care less about trampolines and rope tricks, I was all about the built-in speakers in the headrests, costumes, and lights. 

My favorite interpretations were Lucy in the Sky and Something. OMG, amazing. 

As the lyrics poured onto the stage . . .something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover was like watching a love story unfold in a magical way . . . sent chills up my spine.

My old man loved it, too. He loved it more than Jersey Boys. 

On the other hand, my friend didnt care for it (he only knew 2 songs performed) and was caught dozing off during the last half. Whatever dude.

Glad I saw it, loved it, and remembered it."
Beatles Love,"Absolutely fantastic. Sure - it really shouldnt have Cirque in the name. Youre not going to see the amazing feats of acrobatics that you do in the other shows. That being said... if you have seen the Beatles animated music videos and wondered what theyd look like in real life... this is it. Theres a tremendous amount of visual candy. the props transform into new and cooler things, the music is built into the headrest of each seat, the stage magically transforms with every second.

Really, go and see this show. Just dont expect it to be full on cirque or youll be disappointed."
Beatles Love,"Although its not the most impressive Cirque du Soleil in terms of crazy athleticism, I think its written extremely well and tells such a great story whilst adding the right balance of music and excitement. 

My favorite part was the little yellow rain boots. I wanted to take them home with me :).  The part with the crazy ribbons was also really trippy. So many metaphors and artistic interpretations ... really deep"
Beatles Love,"I have to admit...its getting better...its getting better...all the time.

Unfortunately for us, the LOVE Cirque didnt follow the Beatles tune quite THAT closely. It started out good...the opener is a showstopper, but then didnt really get better.

This is a bit of a different-type of Cirque. Its got Cirquelike elements, and there are some seriously spectacular numbers, like their opening and last 2 closing numbers, and a few in the middle like Here Comes the Sun and then the fun Baby You Can Drive my Car...but other than that, they could have made it so much better than it is.

There are SO many Beatles songs to choose from... even I know that, and I am not even a real Beatles fan...and they chose some random slow ones that just did not work with the dance and character numbers they paired them with. 

And the slow contemporary, reflective dance numbers in gauzy white linen?? Hello, I can see that on So You Think You Can Dance for free. Give me WAY more fun, jazzy, crazy Idontknowwheretolookrightnow numbers that are going to keep me from zzzzing during a 10pm show.

I admit to nodding off for a few minutes here and there as did the gal pals who were with me, so it wasnt just me being a tired old lady.

Not on my absolute must see list for Vegas, but if you get stuck there in a pinch, its a fairly entertaining 1.5 hours for $110.  Not sure about the ROI...kinda expensive for balcony seats though we had a good view.

BUT, gotta give props since its a Cirque and the actors and dancers are seriously talented regardless of the choreography. The music was also awesome piped in super loud and jazzed up with some modern beats that worked."
Beatles Love,"What can I say.......its a Cirque show so you know ahead of time what you will be getting, but it is a bit different than the other Cirque shows.  Different in that although you do have the people hanging from the ceiling and folks flipping up and down, you also have some roller skating that is out of this world and pretty good dancing.

 My fondness for the show is because I am a die hard Beatles fan, so seeing this was a happy jaunt down memory lane. I even bought the CD."
Beatles Love,"This is actually my least favorite Cirque show (ruh oh!) so far. I am not a super Beatles fan although I love some of their songs. LOVE is a nice first-timer introduction to the Cirques. It just didnt have the same impact to me like the other Cirques Ive seen.

LOVE did more dancing and entertaining than the other Cirques Ive been to. The musical score is absolutely fantastic and I love the idea that you are totally submersed in this performance. You just cant look away! Yet...I prefer my Cirques to be a kind of stunts and storyline kind of performance, so LOVE being neither of those kept me from the full 5 stars.

Dont let this discourage you from watching it, though. It just didnt sit well with me like the other Cirques and Im not much of a concert fan. And thats basically what LOVE is, which I could totally see working with the majority."
Beatles Love,"They should take the Cirque out of the name and it would get 5 stars.  It was well produced, lots of theater tricks, and excellent production values.  It was loud - way too loud.  I spend the entire time with my thumbs jammed in my ears (which ended up ringing for about 24 hours afterwards).  It was my father-in-laws first Cirque show, and he fell asleep (luckily hes mostly deaf).  

I love cirque shows, but the name comes with impressive stunts and human feats you cant see anywhere else.  This was a dance show with a couple of ropes.  The audience looked bored and Im really annoyed that I wasted my money on this show.  A different cirque show would have been great for them."
Beatles Love,Great show!! If you like the Beatles youll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.
Beatles Love,"Transcendent.

I love the Beatles, which was pretty much the only motivation for me to see a Cirque show or go to Las Vegas, where I hadnt been in at least eight or nine years.

It took Tita and I from February until June to finally confirm a weekend where we were both available and could commit to flying up to see the show. I bought the tickets only a couple of weeks ago, $165 each for fourth-row seats. TOTALLY WORTH IT. The performers were at eye-level, plus every seat had speakers on the front and back of the headrest, so the sound was incredible.

The song choices, as well as the costumes, choreography, and screened images that went along with them, were completely flawless. My favorite portions of the performance were probably the blinding beauty of the sun made of electric candles during Here Comes the Sun, the twinkling lights and dizzying imagery during Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,  the skating act during Help! and of course, the lushness, vitality, and sheer beauty of the final number, All You Need is Love.

Honestly, I was transported. There were times I wanted to cry because it was so overwhelmingly lovely, and times I just laughed and clapped with happiness because it was so absolutely perfect.

One word: GO."
Beatles Love,"This review was from the 7:00 showing on August 27, 2009.

It pains me to give this such a low score.

I remember growing up a  Beatles fan, I appreciated the music and their contributions they made to the world.  My father would sit me down as a kid and  set up some old LPs and play it on his stereo system.  He told me about their history and I grew an appreciation for their music and lyrics.  As I walked in and got seated, we were seated in the middle of section 200, dead center stage.  We were really happy and excited with the tickets.  At first glance the stage venue is extremely impressive, its massive and sits in a arena styled format.  I got seated and got to enjoy listening to some of the house music of the Beatles work, and I also enjoyed seeing a few of the circus performers take to form of John, George, Paul and Ringo all dressed from their different eras.  I especially liked the interactions that the butler with the silver teapot, made with the spectators while we waited for the show to start.  

The show started out fine, but maybe about 20 minutes in, after the second or third song, all the dancers cleared the stage and some of the music resumed.  For about 5 minutes we sat there in the dark waiting for something to happen.  Nothing, we sat in the dark listening to Beatles music.  A few minutes later the house reports that there will be a temporary break and it will resume momentarily.  Im not sure if one of the actors got hurt or if there was something wrong with the stage, but we sat there for 25 more minutes, in the dark listening to music.  The users didnt make it any easier, they tried to discourage us from getting up, insisting that the show will resume shortly.  They eventually got whatever they needed to be fixed, but with the show running behind schedule and in talking to a couple other people who have saw the review, have told me that they saw things that may have been cut out of our show, so they could catch up and make up time that they lost so they could be ready for the next show that was to come.  I was not interested in shelling out a 130 bucks again to find out.

Despite the technical difficulties they had, there were some really glaring issues that I had that I couldnt over look.  First of all, this was Cirque du Soleil, I was expecting so see more acrobatics and other circus feats, but compared to shows like Ka, Zumanity and O, they seemed to have skimped on this aspect.  I understand they wanted to focus on the Beatles music, but, I know Beatles music, I would have rather wanted to see the interpretation that Cirque would have done with it.

The other issue I had was due to the stage, at times, even from our central position in section 200, there were times the layout of the stage was cut out to accommodate more seating, as a result you got little corners that were obscured from view.  I found this flaw annoying especially, when some of the audience may have seen something really cool due to all the Ooohs and Ahhhs... and we couldnt see what happened.  Or there were quite a few times that there were so many performers on stage, that it began to look like a giant mob on stage and it became very easy to lose track on what you were supposed to look at.

I think the thing that was probably most confusing was the lack luster story line, it felt as though they were trying to tell a story but failed to make it clear to the audience.  It was extremely loose and it seemed the director decided it would be a good idea for the audience to fill in the blanks.   Its not a good sign during  our forced intermission that we heard 6 conversations around us, asking about what the story line was.  If you want to be that abstract do what most ballets do and give us a freaking playbill with a background storyline.  This issue was significantly apparent in the first 4 scenes of the show.  There were also pretty of what the hell scenes as well, but I think that may have been due to the fact that they we trying to materialize the imagination of these four musicians when they were under LSD influences.

I know for a fact most people will go see this show, regardless of my experience and if you appreciate the music, you should.  Just make sure you keep your expectations in check.  I made the mistake of building it up in head, but if I look at it objectively, as a Cirque du Soleil, it isnt in my top three productions, its not even in my top five, its probably my one least favorite of the Cirques.  I dont think I could shell 130 bucks on seeing the show again and see what I may have missed from another seating angle, instead I think I would rather go onto amazon.com and go ahead and buy the digitally remastered, Beatles Stereo Box Set...  It costs about the same.  I know I wont have any technical difficulties on my home stereo."
Beatles Love,Go see absinthe instead. Unless you want to pay 100 dollars to see people frolic around a dance floor. Which you can. If you hate yourself.
Beatles Love,"I was the girl with kaleidoscope eyes mesmerized by movement, symmetry, patterns, beauty, colors, and dimensions.

Picture yourself in a seat in a theatre 
Double fisting your drinks that rest on your thighs
Somebody loves you, you think of them fondly 
The girl who always cries 

Floating acrobatic dancers with a white sheet
Parachuting over your head
Look for the boy with flowers in his hand
And hes gone

Shaila in the night with thousands
Leena in the night with thousands
Anjali in the night with thousands

Follow us down to a bar by a fountain
Where swaying gluttons eat truffle french fries
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

 Old yellow taxis appear on the curb
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And youre gone"
Beatles Love,"Before blurting out a dramatic comment to the disrespectful heels such as, youre such a stupid get, I checked myself before I wrecked myself, reminded it wasnt my weight to carry and to Love! Love love love love...

Doing my best to turn off my mind, relax, and float downstream, what I couldnt quite figure out was the purpose for the two white-robed KKK members part of the Benefit for Mr. Kite segment. Id like to think they were just whirling dervishes with strange triangular shaped headdresses, but the burning cross on the side of the half-pipe used by the elaborate rollerblades (a mindlessly entertaining scene might I add) made my companion and I think otherwise. Another baffling scene was that of the step-dancing rain boots to the tune of another McCartney throw-a-way, Lady Madonna. During this segment, a troop of African-Americans clobber their way through lyrics such as Lady Madonna children at your feet/wonder how you manage to make ends meet/who finds the money when you pay the rent?/Did you think that money was heaven sent? while surrounding a pregnant lady. I was a caught off guard and to be honest, flat out offended that the director of Love assumed that a person in such a perilous financial situation as Lady Madonna would have to be African-American. It has been rumored that Blackbird is a song about the civil rights movement, encouraging it which makes me think that the scene was an attempt of the director to prove that the Beatles demolished all moral barriers and crossed the thresholds of repression, but if so, it was not very effective and possibly too abstract for a Vegas show that, no offense fellow yelpers, but the majority of reviews offer little on the context of the show, sticking more along the lines of I loved love and paid a lot to see it. But then again, a later scene explores a war protest on trampolines, praising communism as a youngster holds a Warhol-esque picture of Mao while the notorious song Revolution blurts out Well you know, you better free your mind instead! Oh well, everyone great was always contradicting themselves. Later during the spectacle, during the mystical sounds of Here Comes the Sun a stereotypical Buddhist (well, eastern oriented) spiritual meditation occurs where raiders of the lost arc looking cirque members proceed into sun salutations looking up in wonder to the sky as candles burn in front of them. Really, I dont think George Harrison would have been too fond of the execution of his most revered track. I could have also done without the Octupus Garden scene.

The intricate details of dream-like props such as a model train on a track carrying lit tea candles, tiny rubber boots on strings, cast-ironed framed Volkswagen bugs, Michelin man titanium pants, and fog-generating umbrellas it undeniable that the set ornamentation of Love is spectacular.  

A theatre teacher rammed home that a re-occurring theme is always something to be aware of and the most prevalent of these in Love was the lost young man with a bouquet of flowers the audience becomes acquainted with before the show even begins as he aimlessly walks through the crowd as they take their seats.  It is unclear whether he is searching for a particular recipient for his daisies and he is the most clown-like character on stage. For those who have seen it, I would love ideas as to what he symbolizes. 

During the standing-ovation that the circque du soleil ensemble receive at the end of the show, the artists point to the monitors where full-sized george, paul, ringo and john are displayed in life-like video. For some odd reason, the audience stops clapping at this point, which sings to me that the Beatles music has been so thoroughly absorbed into our consciousness that what occurred on stage surpasses sound. That throughout the process of watching Love the audience becomes desensitized to who made the music or the fact that anyone made the music at all, theoretically the performers and the set are all that mattered during the full-fledged Vegas production that is the Love spectacle."
Beatles Love,"Absolutely fucking amazing!!!

We picked up discounted tickets at the Tix 4 Tonight booth the day before. We ended up paying $106 for $175 tickets.  The show was awesome,  I want to see it again because there is so much going on there is no way to catch everything in one sitting.  So worth the money, everyone left smiling."
Beatles Love,"I just got back from a few days in Vegas and have now seen all the Cirque shows there (except Believe, which from what Ive heard may be their Ishtar). Its true what other reviewers are saying: If youre seeking unbelievable acrobatics, feats of strength, balance and athleticism, there are better choices you can make than LOVE -- Mystére and O are the obvious answers.

But if you get off on a show that elevates the theatrical experience to its highest, state-of-the-art, world-class level, with a truly astounding array of wildly creative, insanely inventive and surprisingly transforming setpieces, ingenious costumes, motion graphics, lighting and special effects, all backing a huge cast of talented, stunning and en pointe performers, set to a lushly and skillfully mixed soundtrack created from the original studio masters for what became the blueprint for modern pop and rock... well, youll be in hog heaven like I was. LOVE is a rich feast for the senses, and probably about as close as you can come to experiencing psychedelic drugs without actually doing them.

The good folks at Cirque du Soleil know how to put on a show. They spare no expense and craft intricate productions where every detail has been carefully considered and perfected. I find that very inspiring.

I took advantage of the Summer of Cirque promotion and got a $50 ticket, which put me in the back of the balcony, what you might call one of the worst seats in the house, but honestly it turned out to be a great vantage point. There is a LOT going on throughout the whole arena. Id sit up there again in a second. I think sitting too close to the stage would probably be a mistake; you wouldnt be able to take it all in.

The music itself -- Im paraphrasing this from the amazon page for the soundtrack CD (Dammit! Now Im gonna have to buy it... why isnt it on iTunes!?):  Love is a mélange of the familiar and obscure, all literally mixed together in one 78-minute audio collage which succeeds in reminding the listener just why the Beatles truly are, as Lennon put it, toppermost of the poppermost. Theres no new Beatles material here per se, but the songs are all approached differently -- some are cut together in a flawlessly mixed medley (check out Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You/Helter Skelter), some reassemble different backing tracks and vocal performances to create new spins on old classics; but all the songs are revitalized considerably. It begins with a twittering of birdsong lifted from Across the Universe and once the haunting, triple-tracked a capella harmonies of Because enter, followed by snatches from A Hard Days Night and The End, leading into a fired-up Get Back (as the darkened theatre explodes to life in one of the shows many larger than life, wild and dynamic transitions), it becomes obvious that this is far more than just another Beatles compilation. This is Love, conceived by the Fabs former producer George Martin and son Giles.

I could blather on and on like a gushing fanboy about all the brilliant details of this lavish production, which combined so flawlessly to give me not one but multiple goosebump moments -- those rare occasions where you experience something so magical that you get an actual physical sensation: a wave of chills up your spine and all the hairs on your body standing on end -- but I think Ill leave it at this:

For me, this is live theatre at its very best. Thank you, Cirque du Soleil! You have surprised and amazed me, and fanned the flames of passion that burn in my soul once again! I love you forever."
Beatles Love,"I know very little about the Beatles and was apprehensive about spending a lot of money on tickets. But at the end of the show, I couldnt have been happier. And more importantly, I was feeling a little cheated that the only music group that I had to grow up with was New Kids on the Block 
The dancing and acrobatics were amazing. Its a great theatre setup, and the higher seats are still fantastic for viewing all the stage. It was a multi-sensory experience. During Here Comes the Sun, I could smell the incense and was ready to practice my best meditations. 
The show is about 90 minutes and has no intermission so plan your eating, drinking and pottying accordingly."
Beatles Love,"I went to this show kicking and screaming practically lol.  I honestly didnt want to go bec I am not a fan of the Beatles.  However, I was pleasantly surprised .. I thought the show was amazing.  The acrobatics were so cool and I had a great time !"
Beatles Love,"Beatles fans, prepare to wet your pants, because this is 2 hours of Beatles euphoria.

The stage is in the center, with the audience surrounding it.  This leads to some awkward seats and awkward angles.  Also,  there were a couple of the acts, where me and my brother were literally like wtf why is this even happening.  They just didnt seem to fall into place.

but if you want to reminisce of the times where music was ACTUALLY music, then this is the show for you"
Beatles Love,"Outstanding!  My first live Cirque show...expensive as fuck, but totally worth the money.  Who gives a shit if there were less acrobatics than at other shows?  I dont...the show was engaging, visually stunning (in a few spots, its like youre trippin), and very energetic.  Absolutely worth the money and time.

Get your tickets online or through one of the places on the strip that sell tickets to get them for a discount."
Beatles Love,"It was so beautiful that I cried when it was ending. No joke.

Its true, it doest really matter where you sit. Every seat offers an extensive view of the stage (which changes forms throughout the show). To be honest, youll probably enjoy an upper-level seat more than the ground-level ones. My boyfriend and I thought we were getting jipped because there was a railing right in front of us. Lo and behold, that didnt matter one bit.  There is one part of the show (I wont post any spoilers) where it really is best if youre sitting at the top since the people on the lower levels are blinded. 

Ive had the LOVE album for almost a year now and to be able to finally see the show is just icing on the cake. I was probably the happiest person in the theatre. 

Id go see the show again in a heartbeat."
Beatles Love,"Never actively listened to the Beetles much. Everyone hears their music but I never knew how much I heard until the Love Show nor how much music they influenced.
I understand why some people may not have enjoyed it as much.  Especially if they dont like Beatles music or were expecting more acrobatics, but the show was just downright fun.
Though, there should be a warning regarding all the lights.
It is probably the closest youll get to a beetles concert / music video.
I definitely want to go again, but next time with a different state of mind."
Beatles Love,Super entertaining. The audience involvement was awesome with the white blanket. The little boots and the water scene was my fav!
Beatles Love,"I have seen Love twice now, and although it will never be as memorizing or spectacular as it was the first time I saw it, the show is still fabulous.  Its easily the best Cirque show Ive ever seen.  If you are a Beatles fanatic, you must see this show."
Beatles Love,"Its a Beatles concert, Cirque du Soleil style.  How can you go wrong?  The music and performance was incredible, a feast for the eyes and ears.  Because of the concert-like quality, it had a different feel from the other Cirque shows, which isnt a bad thing at all!  LOVE is on my top 5 list here in Vegas, I could definitely see this more than once!"
Beatles Love,"Wow. I cant begin to describe the wonderful experience I had here. I have always been a Beatles fan, but after seeing this, it really got me into looking at the era and all of the happenings in the counterculture. 

Anyways, the show itself was fantastic! Ive never seen anything so beautiful. The music is a mix of popular songs and clips from their original recordings in Abbey Lane. The whole show follows the summer of love theme and is performed following a story. The tricks were neat to watch too ;) 

I was so poor at the time I saw this, I seriously wanted to buy out their gift shop. My eyes were humongous when I walked in! I had to get a copy of the soundtrack, and whenever I listen to it, I smile like a fool.

This is one of those things in life that you have to experience yourself. If you find yourself in Vegas, I highly suggest that you put this on your itinerary. The stage is in the center of the seating area and everything they do is symmetrical, so no matter where you are seated, youll have a great view. 

Now to get myself to Vegas somehow and see this again..."
Beatles Love,"I came here with my girl after countless visits to Vegas and never catching a show. Cirque de Soleil is just awesome. Our seats were mid level, but no complaints here. Im not a huge Beatles fan, but I walked away with a better appreciation for their songs. 

The stage people are goddamn good at their jobs. They switched stages so fast it was unbelievably seamless. While watching the show I would selectively pick acrobats from the stage to see if they were masking anything. Nope. Everyone had a role and were just on point. 

The props were just sharp. People coming from the ceiling, underground, sides, everywhere. Your eyes will never get bored. Each seats headrest had some crazy theater quality sound pumping into your eardrums. This enhanced the total experience. $300 bucks well spent for my girl and I. The set was 90 minutes. Im trying to debate which Cirque to see next time."
Beatles Love,"One of the Best Cirque du Soleil  shows EVER!!! The music is intoxicating and the vibe of the theater makes you wanna jump and dance at some points and in other cry your heart out. You dont have to be a Beatles fan to see it, however, you would leave this show being a PERMANENT BEATLES FAN!!

OMG what a great show!! We got great tickets 2x1 at the box office and a awsome view. Even if not a fan youll love the music and storyline!"
Beatles Love,"This show was great!!!  With the huge screens on the sides and the music just the way I like it, LOUD AND PROUD!  My mom was bummed because she thought there would be more acrobatic things going on but I thought there was enough!  The roller bladders were the coolest!

Im glad I sat up high instead of close to the stage because I did not have to be looking up a lot like they were, plus they get covered with a sheet at one point and I dont think they can see what is going on.

I got one of the big drinks that was a Pina Colada, DONT EVER DRINK A PRE-MADE FROZEN SHUGGERY DRINK THEY ARE ALWAYS BAD.  I wish I got a hard alcohol drink.  But the drink was good for a little while but then it got to be too much.

But the show was great, I recommend it!  But if you looking for a very Cirque du Soleil show I dont think this is the one."
Beatles Love,"First and foremost, a 5-star shout out to keith a., Nevada resident and super-yelper extraordinaire! With A Little Help From My (yelp) Friends, the boy and I had the chance to see LOVE in Las Vegas for the first time.

After a Hard Days Night in the Jockey Club (see below review), we were exhausted and ready for some quality, non-cheesy-timeshare-show-tickets entertainment.

LOVE was magical. Amazing seats. We were a little worried about visibility when we sat down to stare at a huge curtain in front of us and considered asking for Help! but it dropped soon enough and Thats All Right (Mama).

The acrobatics, colors, visuals and sound-in-your-seat setup were incredible, the show was well thought-out and presented. The music had me tapping my feet the whole time and although the woman next to me was an obnoxiously loud and chronic WOO WOO WOO!-er (its a show lady, not a live concert), I loved every second.

If I could see it Eight Days A Week I would! Ill Be Back for sure and would highly recommend that everyone Come Together and check it out."
Beatles Love,"An absolutely FUN show with a capital F.  Much different from the other Cirque shows since its not chockful of daring acrobatics like O or Ka but its sure to please.  You dont even have to be a Beatles fan to appreciate the show cuz the music is fun and it looks like a big party down on the stage.   Like other Yelpers have said, there is no bad seat in the theater."
Beatles Love,"Sensory overload.  Im extremely happy I sought closer seats at the later show.

In a word, incredible."
Beatles Love,"Okay, I was blown away! Amazing! 

If I did drugs, then watching this is what I think having a great trip would have been. Its a beautiful dream thats takes you on a journey telling you the story of the Beatles and their music. 

Visually amazing and I think the show plays well in any seat you have. We had terrific seats, but the theater is set up in a way that is very clean to see the stage. This was my first Cirque du Soleil show so I was impressed and definitely want to see the others. 

This made our night in Vegas. great dinner and show, then some gambling. we had one night to have some fun and I have no regrets. We has loads of fun! 

Great experience!"
Beatles Love,"This was a very good show.  I enjoyed it.  My only disappointments were the lack of acrobatics and contortionist tricks and the extremely chilly theater.

To start off, I dont want to give too much credit to the good music because, I mean, its the Beatles.  You cant really miss if youve got that as your starting point - I almost feel like theyre cheating with that as their basis.  Still, I did enjoy the music and left thinking that I really need to beef up my collection of Beatles songs.  The obvious trick is to interpret the Beatles songs in a beautiful and artistic way, and this show certainly accomplished that.  It was visually stunning - colorful, dreamy, sparkly, enticing.  The show flowed very well and the sets were gorgeous.  We probably got the worst seats available in our price range and, having seen it once, I would maybe return but would go for the balcony seats.  Its just not the kind of show where I think it makes a huge difference if youre really close because there is so much going on all over the place.

While it was beautiful and I enjoyed watching everything that was displayed for me, I was expecting there to be more acrobatics, contortions and feats of strength since it is a Cirque du Soleil show.  Had I known going in that there just wouldnt be many of those, I would not have been waiting for them and maybe would not have been as disappointed.  In that sense, it is very unlike other Cirque du Soleil shows.  Its more like musical theater but with recorded music and choreography and imagery and effects, kind of like Movin Out with ballet set to contemporary music, except that it was prettier and didnt suck and there was not really any ballet.  It was nice, but I might check out some other Cirque du Soleil shows to get my fill of acrobatics before returning to see this one again.  With Love, you definitely are going for Beatles music and for the scenery, which is all very lovely."
Beatles Love,"Who needs drugs when you have music and visuals like this?  This show is incredible.  My friend got free tickets as part of the room package, and as such the seats were way up high.  That in *no* way detracted from the experience.  In fact, you have a particular advantage because of the effect about halfway through the performance.  (I wont give it away, but its awesome!)  You dont have to be a hardcore Beatles fan to appreciate this show, either.  Although after an experience like this, how could you not be compelled to become one?"
Beatles Love,"Sadly, I did not love Love. I wanted to! It was a great concept, but, you know, should very odd French Canadians really be let loose on the Beatles song book? You tell me.

It was totally RANDOM, man. Better vibe for like Pink Floyd or Queen. The opening number was GREAT, electrifying, cleverly live-concert like, and then things fell apart from there.

Hypocritically, I thought they could do MORE. The middle sagged, unlike the zero-percent-body-fat performers. And then the scene grew dark. There was a war in the middle for the love of Ringo!

The only memorable and new thing I saw was the trampoline bit.

Dare I say it? Could it be that Cirque du Soleil is overdone? Spread too thin? They only have a different show at every single casino. Could it be that, I know its damn near un-American to say it, that Cirque du Soleil is totally played out at this point? 

Anyone else had enough of Cirque? Its the Will Ferrell of circuses!!!"
Beatles Love,"Came here with friends from Hawaii and Colorado so it was a festive event. We had great seats and we were ready to see a great show...and what a GREAT show it was!! I loved this Cirque show.
I am a huge Beatles fan of course and was concerned that they would not be able to pull it off...but they did!
What an amazing show. Well worth the $$. I think its the best show I have seen so far. Would love to see it again for sure. If your a Beatles fan check it out!!"
Beatles Love,"If your a Beatle fan you will be crazy about this show.  It has a great opener and then tons of Beatle songs nonstop!  We were sitting very high up but we could still see a the entire stage and it had tons of dancing, jumps in the air, and crazy moves.  It is different from the other Cirque shows I have seen since it is more focused on dancing than acrobatics.  I think it was not perfect and maybe they could have put some other Beatle songs in there.  The other thing was our crowd seemed a bit quiet but it was Monday night and show started at ten so maybe they were a bit pooped.  I will admit I was tired.  Very entertaining and fun!  Not sure if worth $110.00 for 1 1/2 hours unless you are a diehard Beatle fan!"
Beatles Love,"How do you do a tribute to the Beatles Cirque du Soleil style? 

Well, you can, but it is a little departure from your expected Cirque shows, as in each act really isnt tied to one another. With that in mind, and a little knowledge of the Beatles and the love of Cirque, you have a really feel good experience here. Nothing over the top, nothing too mind blowing, just a fun show that illuminates one of the biggest and most fantastic musical sensations in our modern history.

I can say that there is possibly no bad seat in the house, as it is a center stadium stage that is surrounded by seating. I would only suggest the closer the better."
Beatles Love,"After reading the yelp reviews, we exchanged our Zumanity tickets for Beatles Love.  I think it was a wise decision.  We got there right on time and were still upgraded to closer seats.  

As with Ka, Beatles Love had high-flying acrobatics and (of course) awesome music.  Theres a pretty cool light show too.  

You dont have to love Beatles or music to like this show, but it helps.  Otherwise, youd be like my friends and not know any of the lyrics.

I was able to find tickets for our group online for $55.  I would have paid up to $90ish for this experience though."
Beatles Love,"Not a big Vegas show fan, not a big Beatles fan, but I am now a fan of Cirque du Soleil: The Beatles Love.  

Why I liked it: 
- $10 dollar 32 ounce beers or $15 dollar 32 ounce cocktails, perfect
- Price
- Insane visuals, music and performers flying overhead

Vegas is all about good drink specials and while you wait for Beatles Love I highly recommend taking advantage.  If you have seen the movie Knocked Up youll find the entire experience very reminiscent of their Cirque du Soleil experience except at the end of the show youll be on your feet applauding.

Guys if you want to take your girl to a show in Vegas that doesnt involve male strippers or typical broadway atmosphere, check out The Beatles Love."
Beatles Love,"This is a great show to catch if youre a Beatles fan.  I grew up listening to the Beatles because my father is such a big fan (so big of a fan that he named my older sister after one of ther songs).  Overall, Cirque du Soleils performance was stellar.  I wasnt sure how they were going to incorporate the music with their skills, but I ended up becoming a fan of the show and would love to watch it again.

FYI: if you plan on watching the show, dont bother with orchestra seats because the higher up you are, the better.  With all Cirque du Soleil shows, theres a lot of things going on at once so its better if youre higher up so you dont strain your neck watching."
Beatles Love,"This is my first Cirque du Soleil show.  I liked it a lot, the aerial activities were amazing, especially the guy on the swing and the women doing the Indian rope dances.  The music was fantastic. 
One thing I think they need to improve is to get the right dance style for the Beatles.  They need to get some authentic Gazzarri type dancers, that were around in the 60s and omit the Break Dance, Pop Lock and Stomping, all of which I like, but came much later and had nothing to do with the Beatles."
Beatles Love,"Fun show, great music, time flew by! There was so much going on it was hard to see it all, but show was great, I would recommend it. Just dont sit in the front row ( or the first few) You think 1st row is the best! Its not. I wish we wouldve sat higher. There is a lot of smoke that covers you and you have to lift your head up the whole time to see everything in the air.

Good for all ages, even saw kids there who were having fun."
Beatles Love,"An amazing show on every level possible!!  The lady love and I watched the show for New Years and we sat on the upper level which was neat to be able to watch the performers fly in from the sides of the sky.  

The audio in that space was superb, really just music coming at you from every direction.  The choreo was so fun and on point to the music.  From bunji jumping, to break dancing, roller blading to traditional lyrical...its has it all.  I would watch the show again...only exception is if Michael Jacksons Cirque comes around sooner than later....cuz you know its all about MJ.

A must see, even if you dont go out drinking and partying for one night, this experience will be kept in your memory bank for some time to come..."
Beatles Love,"Wow. All I have to say is I was beyond impressed.beautiful and talented dancers and acrobats. Amazing music, and the best moves! Props were beyond cool, and the special effects show midshow was astonishing. I didnt want to leave, and now I am depressed its not the 60s. And that ill never see the Beatles live. GET BACK!! Get back Beatles. I know. Thats. never going to happen :( the boutique had some cool items!! I wanted everything."
Beatles Love,"Awesome show!  Creative, inspiring, beautiful, fun, engaging.  I dont care about gambling, it is shows like this that I live in Las Vegas!"
Beatles Love,This Cirque de Soleil show Love was amazing. BEATLES!!! Need i say more. Im such a huge fan. Who isnt right!? The performers were amazing and so entertaining. The effects were incredible. The show I believe was an hour and thirty minutes. From beginning to end I was mesmerized and engulfed in the music and performances. We sat in the balcony area which I highly suggest to sit at because you get a 360 panoramic view of the whole stage. There were performers coming from the ceiling and we had a great view of it all. If you were to sit at the front your neck would be killing ya. Anyways all around excellent show. Very magical I loved it!
Beatles Love,"I really appreciate Cirque.  The performers, costuming and presentation is second to none.  I dont always like it or understand it.  The music and plot is sometimes hard to understand and identify with.

LOVE transcends the issues, but offering great music while entertaining in the radical Cirque tradition.

LOVE is a sweet, upbeat and entertaining show.  It is amazing that after 40 years the Beatles are more relevant and important than ever."
Beatles Love,"I love, love, love this show. This coming from a part time Beatles fan. Meaning their music is awesome, but I dont know every song by heart and a techno cd is always chosen before one of theres. BUT this show was so amazing I dont really care what music you put in the background!

The choreography was amazing and there was always 500 things to look at which is good if you also suffer from mild ADD like I do or your under the age of 10. The music goes perfectly of course and the costuming is elaborate. If your looking for a musical or a show about something, I wouldnt recommend this show. But if your looking to watch talented people and let them blow your mind with their talents, then head on down to Mirage and get yourself some tickets!

If your going spur of the moment like I did you can sometimes get good deals at the half price ticket offices. Not always half price but a discount is nice when tickets run $100+."
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque show ever, and it was AWESOME! Apparently there isnt as much acrobatics as there are in other shows, but nevertheless it was fantastic.

It seems like all the seats in the house were pretty good. Also, definitely dont forget to buy a $13 margarita, theyre actually pretty good and come in a sweet plastic souvenir cup! 

You cant beat the soundtrack, I definitely got caught singing along, much to the annoyance of my neighbors, who roughly elbowed me promptly.

Great show, and check out the Beatles themed bar outside the arena for a flashback to the 60s, or, if youre too young, like myself, a flashback to the last time you watched Austin Powers."
Beatles Love,"If you are looking for Chinese acrobats as in other Cirque du Solei shows, dont go to this show.  But if you love the Fab 4 and a great visual show interpreting a variety of their songs- you have to see this show.  

Although our seats were good there didnt seem to be a bad seat in the house.   The costumes were amazing - a visual masterpiece and the sound was INSANE (just like the ticket prices!) 

I especially love how they took sound bites of the Beatles talking and incorporated it into the show.  Oh how I wish I could have been brought up when music was really meaningful...(sigh)."
Beatles Love,"Went last weekend with the whole family and all of us had a great time! You definitely have to like the Beatles music since the primary focus is their music, but with the addition of the Cirque Du Soleil acrobatic stunts it was awesome! I love how the seating is set up, which surrounds the entire stage, so there is no bad seat. It was our first Cirque Du Soleil show and definitely wont be our last!!"
Beatles Love,"Beatles songs on full blast with lot of dancing, acrobatics, and outrageous costumes. 

I got my tickets through the Mirage box office online. There was a holiday special price for $88 and I got the confirmation that these tickets were going to be on hold for me until I picked them up. The seats that I got were awesome, it was the last row of section Section 200. I can see everything, it is true that the further you are from the stage, the better. 

The one part of the show loved, is when the song, Something (Something in the way she moves) was played. The song was interpreted through acrobatics and romance. It was a welcomed and lovely performance after hearing the other lively and happy Beatles melodies. Another part, that I like was the skateboarding act. Dont mean to ruin it for you, but the kiddies and tweens will love that part. 

If you are a Beatles addict, dont miss this show! Look at the Mirage website for price specials."
Beatles Love,"Not your average Cirque!  I loved the dancing and story line of this performance.  Ive seen at least 8 different Cirque shows and loved them all.   This one focuses more on dance, music, politics, and the attitude of a generation.  Youll love it, but be ready for loud music and a rowdy atmosphere."
Beatles Love,"First let me preface this by saying that I still think O by Cirque is still the best of the Cirque shows.  Having said that, I really enjoyed this show.  Its located in The Mirage Hotel &amp; Casino, so its not the newest of the new hotels in Vegas but at least it isnt a dump.

In order to get to the show entrance, you have to walk down this path that leads conveniently by the Beatles store.  There are a few photo opps with Beatles memorabilia backdrops.  The ushers are dressed in Sergeant Pepper costumes and are very willing to take a picture with you.

The stage is set in the center of the auditorium with seating 360 degrees around.  Like all Cirque shows, you will find performers appearing from everywhere above and below.  I wasnt totally in love with the show but maybe I didnt have the best seat.  I will say that the best part of the show was the music.  It was all Beatles music and I actually really like the Beatles.

Its a definite recommend from me!"
Beatles Love,"The most useful advice I can give about the show is to sit further back!  There is so much going on in this show and theres so much to see!  Also, in one of the acts, they pull a huge white sheet over 2/3 of the audience, but if you sit far back enough, you can see whats going on above the sheet (and its worth seeing!).  Not only do you get a better view, but you save money too!  Get seats in Category 2 or 3. 

As for the show itself, its amazing! There arent as many stunts (typical of Cirque shows) as there is dancing, but theres definitely that magical Cirque touch.  The show is entertaining and entices your emotions.  You leave the theater feeling good, with warm fuzzies and all :)"
Beatles Love,"This was insane!!!! Awesome show from start to finish. This tribute to the beatles in Cirque du Soleil flavor was purely sick. The stage props, performers, music and overall concept/imagery made this better than a rock concert. The theater does not have a bad seat and the acrobatic ability of the performers was draw dropping. Ihave seen three other Cirque shows. this is by far the best..

When in Vegas go see this show....."
Beatles Love,"Unbelievable. Its been awhile since I had came out of a show and was left speechless. This Cirque du Soleil show, is by far the BEST one to see in Vegas. The tricks and music, is just TOP NOTCH! Ive see Zumanity 3 times, and now I must give up that habit for a new fix!"
Beatles Love,"Because this was based on Beatles music, in some ways it was less artsy than other Cirque shows (I have seen many of them)...but in a good way. I would say that dance and dramatic interpretation of the music was more the focus than acrobatics (unlike other shows). 

It was moving, beautiful, happy, sad, nostalgic...

We had friends in town who got a locals deal - $150 tix for $90 each. I would say, more than anything else we did this past weeked, it was the best money we spent!"
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show ever and had read many review saying it was more theatrical than the others (which is true...I later on saw La Nouba in FL a month later), but hey, it was Valentines Day, my first time in Vegas with my husband, this was the show to go.

We got tickets for level 2 seats which were great--not too close, not too far, though its a 360 arena so I guess there really wasnt a bad seat in the house.

The show started and it was sensory overload. The sights, the sounds, it was AWESOME! My husband and I are only in our 20s, but damn, the Beatles had some freakin awesome hits! We both loved it and I bought the soundtrack later on.

My husbands not for theatrical stuff, but he admitted that he liked it more than he thought he would. He said whenver he got bored with the drama, he listened to the music :o)

Id highly recommend it to everyone! It was a truely wonderful experience."
Beatles Love,"Loved it, no pun intended.

I am a big Beatles fan, especially early Beatles, so I am partial, but at the same time I am not a big CDS fan, so that probably balances out to make me the average show-goer.

I loved the quick set changes, the video effects, all of it. I wont go into too many details so that youll be surprised.

Note of frugality: I saw cheaper tickets were available online (20% off!) through the CDS site for 10 pm shows that they wont give you if you call the box office or go through Mirage directly. We didnt get them before we left home, and then couldnt get the discount.

Ticket tip: It is a small theatre, and all seats are good as they say, but I would recommend the middle section for the best views. High enough to get a perspective of everything, low enough to see faces. We were in the higher section of the balcony and it was a bit too high for me.

Booze advice: Dont drink the Cant Buy Me Love cocktail. Sure, it has a fun name and seems like the thing to do, but dont. Luckily, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, so thank God the headache and hangover from this giant drink stayed behind."
Beatles Love,"Thought I had entered a time machine, the transformation to the 60s hit me like a brick. The music brought back memories of my childhood. We really enjoyed this show, unlike other Cirque shows but just as enjoyable. The seating and sound were excellent. 

We found the stage to be amazing, so many transformations. One minute you see London during World War II, next Liverpool in the 50s and 60s. The music transcends time and made me realize what musical geniuses the Beatles really were. The lyrics bring all sorts of emotions forward. 

Im certain well see this show again."
Beatles Love,"This show is quite interesting with a twist of excitement and of course modern day racism. Certain people probably really enjoyed the show myself as well as my husband did until they depicted Muddy waters as a black dead beat father who could not support his numerous children( just a side note muddy only fathered 4 children). His numerous children with magical yellow rainboots and a pregnant black mother dancing around chasing muddy waters for money was astonishing due to all his contribution to the Blues and the Beatles.  Remember the Beatles wanted to meet Muddy waters they were fans.  The Beatles didnt see color, but how sad to see a legend presented poorly in Vegas .  For the rest of the show it was great, but who really cares anyway unless your a hard working African  American couple sitting front row and can pay the bills. :)"
Beatles Love,"Truly as good as it gets!!  

5 Stars because...
- the 360 degree view seating provides a more intimate feel
- they didnt try to cover any of the songs and used real clips of the Beatles songs (if it aint broke, dont fix it)
- the song selection and mix kept the show pace appropriate 
- the artistic interpretations of the songs were interesting and not trite
- lastly, the $15 frozen margarita came in a Beatles LOVE cup and was absolutely delicious!

This show is a stunning visual display of artistic interpretations of Beatles songs using a combination of dancing, acrobatics, and acting.  This isnt a traditional-traditional Cirque, so if youre looking for jaw-dropping acrobatics then perhaps KA or Zumanity would better interest you.

I gave it a standing ovation.

*UPDATE*
Saw the Beatles LOVE show, AGAIN!  This 2nd time around we got our tickets like way late (an hour before show start) and we got amazing seats.  Im talking 3 rows up from stage floor seats.  I could feel the gentle whoosh of air coming from the performers as they danced, and did acrobats literally 4 feet in front of me.  All of the details of this show are worth a good seat.  Music compilation and acting was still en pointe.   There is a great deal of symbolism and artistic references to Beatles culture and U.S. history in the show that you catch more the 2nd time around.  Again, if youre a fan of Beatles music, LOVE is a surefire way to your heart."
Beatles Love,"I cant add anything to the already fantastic overviews of LOVE, but I can offer these tidbits of info:

1)  of all the Cirque shows, this is the one I feel is most worth the money;

2) greatest gift shop EVER - def get the cd recording of the show;

3) took a 15 y/o, 13 y/o and 7 y/o ... they were all completely entertained.  The show moved quickly enough for the 7 y/o, whereas he was quite bored during Mystere.  In fact, that now 8 y/o is a Beatles fanatic and I honestly believe we have LOVE to thank for that!

4) theres not a bad seat in the house. 

 All of these things make LOVE unique amongst the Cirque shows in my book!"
Beatles Love,"This is the most spectacular show I have ever seen! The custom theater accommodates set pieces unlike youve ever seen outside of Vegas. From the car to the telephone booth to the wheel in the sky, the acrobatics defy gravity and the imagination. 

Love was less of a coherent narrative than I had expected; just sit back and enjoy the dreamscape. And of course, if youre not a Beatles fan, dont bother!"
Beatles Love,"This is a great show!  The performers were amazingly talented, and it was very well choreographed.  If you are a huge Beatles fan, there are lots of subtle references to people and places.  I agree with previous reviewer to not purchase orchestra seats.  There are lots of aerial acts that are best seen from the balcony, and one act in particular I dont think you would be able to see at all from the orchestra.  All in all, well worth the money for an amazing show."
Beatles Love,"I was honestly very disappointed. I love CdS shows. I have seen both O and Mystere and was incredibly impressed by both. In particular I love the stunts/circus type things during the show. This show was just dancing to me. Not very interesting... very overpriced.. and lots and lots of people just dancing. Music was great, but that goes without saying."
Beatles Love,"I was not a Beatles fan before seeing this show, but my wife was and I love seeing a new show, so....

This show was excellent! The visual effects were stunning and the dancers were excellent. The music was woven seamlessly into the performance and all I can say was WOW! Im a Beatles fan now!

There was not a bad seat in the house! I think youre actually better off sitting a little higher just to make sure you can see everything."
Beatles Love,"One of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas. I saw it for a 2nd time recently and didnt get as much of a thrill as I did the first time but I still enjoyed the show very much! I came into the show not being a Beatles fan but after the show I cant stop listening to their songs on my ipod! If you are a Beatles fan I would definitely check out this show. Lots of cool acts and entertainment.

I believe this is one of the more expensive Cirque du Soliel shows due to its popularity but I was able to get 2 balcony seats for about $110 each. I have also sat in the limited view seats that are around $95 that were also not bad, but not as exciting as the other seats since you cannot see the whole stage."
Beatles Love,"For sure a fan! 

I am not sure what some reviewers are talking about - THERE IS NOT INTERMISSION!!! Freaking liars!!! 

Anyway, LOVE is a great show, I was curious to see how they would incorporate a Beatles theme into the show, but they did it effortlessly. I love the new layout of Cirque shows in Vegas. If you have been to La Reve, you will understand that it is pretty hard to get a bad seat. We sat in the lower bowl, but I can tell even in the upper level, you will get a pretty view. I just prefer being a little closer. However, if you are too close you can be looking up at the performance. The coloring of the show is pretty crazy. I do not recommend the Bake-Heads to be under the influence for this show.  I want to check out Elvis now at Aria"
Beatles Love,"I wasnt sure if I should review this, because I thought it was so-so.  Everyone raves about it.  Everyone else in our Group loved it.  I thought it was weird.  The music was good.  The actors were impressive.  I was falling asleep.  Getting into the theater was a production and the drinks / snack line was super long.   Just not a show guy."
Beatles Love,"Probably one of the best show in town.  I rarely want to see the show again but when I come next time to LV, Ill definitely  see it again."
Beatles Love,"Ok, the big question before buying tickets: Should you or should you not depending on your interest/fandom of the Beatles.
Obviously, if you actively dislike them you should probably stay away. If youre a major Cirque fan it may be worth it, but the other Vegas option could be better. 
On the other hand, if you are neutral or casual Beatles fan- Go for it! 
Ive seen all the Vegas Cirque shows. This isnt my favorite, but its defiantly the most pure FUN!
The Beatles were my parents generation, so I didnt live during Beatlemania, but to the best of my understanding this show does a great job capturing the fun, silliness, and psychedelic touches of the Beatles world. 
Song choices are always debated in shows like this (ie. Viva Elvis &amp; Michael Jackson: Immortal). Some people expect a Best of or get upset because their personal favorite was left out. The show cant do them all! Sgt. Peppers gets a little extra attention, but the soundtrack samples a little from early to late. 
My pet peeve in these reviews crops up here once again: people that complain about the lack of plot. There isnt supposed to be one! Stop looking for 1st, 2nd, 3rd Act and character development. Its not a movie or theater show. Dont expect a plot. Its not there. Its not supposed to be, youll enjoy it a lot more if you dont search for one.

The Good: Seating! Almost everything is great! Upper level has a different view and gets to see a little that the lower level doesnt and vice-versa. Nothing is all that far from the in-the-round style.
The Bad: If your a Beatles fan, it gets difficult to not sing along. Do make the effort. Rhythmic clapping and tapping is acceptable.
The Message: From start to finish the show creators keep the theme of LOVE and the Beatles message of it, front and center."
Beatles Love,"After having seen 10 different Cirque shows, I expected...oh, I dont know....Cirque? Instead, I got an interpretive dance show with (admittedly great) Beatles music. Only two real Cirque acts; the rest was almost two hours of interpretive dance and floorshow. Not what I have come to expect from the folks who did Mystere and Zumanity.

The remixed Beatles songs were phenomenal, as were the outtakes that were scripted to shadow performers acting it out. However, there were so many areas this show failed. Lady Madonna ended up being a modern African dance number with pregnant women. Here Comes The Sun was completely out of sync: the choreography had nothing to do with the music (music moved fast, they moved slow, etc.). I mean, the list goes on and on.

One note: if you have to go, get the upper balcony seats. Yes, they are less expensive, but you will actually get to see the action without a crick in your neck. Not to mention there is one number where the entire lower seats are covered with a sheet for over 2 minutes. 

See if you can get a deal on the tickets; the prices are in no way justified for what you are seeing, unless you want to see Beatles-inspired dance number with 2 cool acts for less than 5 minutes each sprinkled in."
Beatles Love,"Ive had a love-hate relationship with Cirque for some time. I love the acrobatics and the surreal costumes and effects. I dont like the pretentiousness or the cheesy new age music at all. 

This show overcomes the music problem with pre-recorded tracks of the actual Beatles, which have been remastered, re-mixed, and mashed up, combining different songs at various times. The sound system is mind-blowing, with like 12,000 speakers including speakers in every seat. The aural experience alone is worth the ticket price. Sound comes from every direction, and during the more psychedelic sequences theres a cool echo effect coming from your own headrest. Combine that with Cirques impressive, if pretentious, staging and performers, and youve got a killer show which will give you a new appreciation for the music of the Beatles."
Beatles Love,"If there was a separate Cirque du Soleil rating scale, Id rate it lower but in the big scheme of things, it wasnt a bad show.  It just wasnt what I expected for Cirque du Soleil.

I think if I was a Beatles fan, it would have been much more enjoyable and meaningful.  I didnt get any of the references - Beatles or historical.  We bought the tickets at the last minute and the only two seats were front row.

I liked when there were lots of things going on but when there was just one girl dancing around, I got a little bored.

It was my least favorite Cirque du Soleil show."
Beatles Love,"I love the Beatles and I loved Love! (...and all you really need is love...)

I wanted to see Love for awhile. So, when my husband wanted to go to Vegas for a couple of days, I bought tickets. We were in the second section, which seemed perfect. But, as others have said, there probably isnt a bad seat in the house.

 I was completely mesmerized by this show. I think its one of the better Cirque shows Ive seen, and the star of the show is definitely the music. Its a dizzying combination of effects, acrobatics, costumes, choreography and music.  

I cant wait to go back and see it again!"
Beatles Love,"Who doesnt like the Beatles? And if you Love them, you will surely cream your pants during this show. What better place to do that than in Vegas?

I had never seen a Cirque performance before, so I cant comment on how this one compares to the others -- but on its own, it was quite an elaborate spectacle, infusing projected images with talented dancers, acrobats, skaters, and all sorts of props to provide creative, evocative, and sometimes provocative renditions to the Lovely songs.

We bought our tickets through the Mirage website, which provided for a 25% discount. While there is a such thing as awesome seats, there are also no bad seats per se because of all the projectile action. In fact, if youre higher up, you could get a nice glimpse of the bigger picture.

We hit up will call early, and they gave us two-for-one drink tickets for the lounge, to be patronized before the show. We were thus charmed into getting two drinks each and double-fisting during the show. Good stuff."
Beatles Love,"if youre a fan of the Beatles...then LOVE is for you my friend! 

LOVE just has the capability to appeal to all ages! My parents grew up listening to the Beatles so we bought them tickets when the show first came out as a Christmas gift. They thoroughly enjoyed the songs, dad said the whole show was psychedelic, and they would do sing alongs as well..awww!

now, fast forward to my generation...after having the parentals incessantly play the Beatles on family road trips, I too have grown to love the Beatles! Lucky for me the hubby went through a similar upbringing and we were thrilled to finally watch LOVE together at the Mirage a few weeks ago.

granted it isnt your typical Cirque show with all the crazy acrobatic stunts and death-defying tricks...but for the love of the Beatles and the fun atmosphere the show brings, it truly is an experience to remember.

the LOVE theater is circular so any seat you have offers a good view, though Im sure the closer the better. We ended up watching the show through a Southwest Airlines promotion and noticed that all us promo peeps were in the 300s section. Yeah youre at the highest seating, but you can still see everything and be part of the party=). Its cool because each seat is equipped with its own speakers so you pretty much get the surround sound feeling. 

And despite being seated at the top we still had some up close encounters with some of the performers. Theyve got some little acrobatic stunts that have some performers gliding/flying out from the corners of the theater to center stage.

So if youre in the mood for a feel-good, happy, &amp; entertaining show...go see LOVE!...yknow, because all you need is love ha!"
Beatles Love,"As A huge Cirque du Soleil  fan I was pumped when I found out they were doing a Beatles Tribute show. Mind you I am kinda Young so I have never really gotten to see what they looked like in there prime  but this show gave me that chance and so much more !!!!


Like any typical Cirque du Soleil  show there was the beautiful costumes the AMAZING sets and performers all at the top of there game but this time there was sumthing special in the mix LOVE . As stated in the other reviews  this show is full of emotions , laughter ,passion and the love for one another.

I feel like Im giving to much away if i continue but if given the chance treat yourself to this show. Tickets can be as low as $65 but you can always  find a good deal online be a smart shopper !!!!"
Beatles Love,"A 90 minute sensory overload. Words cant begin to describe all the crazy shit that goes down in this show. 

I had high expectations for this show and Cirque met them all. TIP: book your tickets in advance and call the theatre operator. The lady I talked to saw the show 3 or 4 times and knew the best places to sit. I sat first row, $99 seats. It was perfect cuz you get a full view of the stage and screens and you save a couple bucks too.

I wasnt a big Beatles fan. I knew some songs, but not all. This show will definitely make you a fan and appreciate the beatles legacy. Some say there isnt enough signature Cirque acts, but I think there was a good balance between dance and circus. There will be some beautiful  parts, some butt-clenching parts, some WTF thats so crazy but I love it parts, and some feel good parts. GO SEE IT NOW!"
Beatles Love,"This was my 2nd Cirque Du Soleil,and no comparison, this one was my favorite.  If your in any way a Beatles fan, I would go as far as saying this show is a must see.  Plus, the seats I had for this show were phenomenal."
Beatles Love,"Love, love, love this show.  I saw it about a year and a half ago and am going again in a month.  The sights and artistic performances pumped me up and I leave with that feel good feeling.  Ive seen many Cirque shows and love the uniqueness of LOVE.  Ive never been a huge Beatles fan but I LOVE this show!  Its modern, highly visual and you are encompassed by the performance from your seat.
The ladies at the ticket booth told us that the best seats for this performance are not the ones closest to the stage (which are the most costly).  Because so much of the show is done in the air, be kind to your neck and back and pay for a seat further back.  Your body will thank you for it."
Beatles Love,"One of the best show/performance Ive ever seen. I enjoyed it alot. I love love love.. couldnt comment more about how great the show is. although i am not exactly the beatle generation. I enjoyed every moment of it. 

Dont want to give too much away. you wont be disappointed =)"
Beatles Love,"My fiance took me to see this show back in 2008. This show is all around FUN! We sat towards the middle (recommended). No joke, after the first few notes of the first song, I had a smile on my face and got giddy. This show is AWESOME! 

If you like The Beatles - this is a MUST!"
Beatles Love,"What can I say except, I LOVE LOVE!! I have seen it now three times and it never fails to impress!! I am a huge fan of Cirque du Soleil, I have seen OVO, O, LOVE and Zumanity, and I am pretty sure that LOVE is my favorite, but its a tough call.  I think the only way that someone wouldnt like this show is if they absolutely hated Beatles music..... is that even possible??

One thing I noticed about this show, when comparing it to other Cirque shows, is that it is a lot more dancing than actual stunts, which is fine because it is still just as amazing and visually pleasing as the other shows with more daredevil acts.  

If for some reason you are on the fence about seeing this show, just keep in mind that there is a reason why it is one of the top shows Vegas has to offer."
Beatles Love,"I drank coffee while in anticipation for the show to start @ 930. 
Then, I downed a beer while waiting for them to let everyone in. 
By the time the show started I HAD TO PEE LIKE NOBODYS BUSINESS! 

Let me just say from start to finish, you will be highly entertained &amp; even the screams from your bladder will soon be forgotten. 

Sat at 207 / L7 (me) &amp; L8 (BF). 12/21 / 10PM show $170 w/ discount $127. 
The original price was set @ 170, but two days before the show &amp; when I purchased the tickets, Mirage was offering 25% off their website for certain dates. Plenty dates to choose from ... 

Whether you are a fan or not ... its a damn entertaining show &amp; youll walk out singing, humming, to the tune of luucy in the sky with diamonds ... reaches all generations. 
I dont want to describe details of the show bc its a gift watching it completely not knowing what to expect. 

Save KA for another day, save O for a rainy day, and go see LOVE.

Lastly, if you need to pee asap after the show skip waiting in the line for the bathroom inside the show arena (theres only three small stalls)... run out over the sports betting area (CPK) and take care of business there. The restrooms right next to the ticketing area will be jammed pack too!"
Beatles Love,"Ive never been a huge Beatles fan (I mean, I like them well enough) and maybe that was my problem. I think to really love this show youve got to love all the songs and know them inside and out. Ive seen a few other cirque shows and so I know how they can wow, and I was a little let down by this performance -- for instance, its got nothing on Eaux (O), one of their other Vegas shows. There is lots of stuff going on on the stage at once, a nice variety of numbers, and the performers are obviously very talented, but as a whole, as a show, I would only recommend this to die-hard Beatles fans. I enjoyed Eaux and Blue Man Group both more than Love."
Beatles Love,"We totally lucked out when we scored the very last tickets for the 7pm show this last wknd. Our seats were insane, we were practically on the stage. To see the characters up close was very exciting. At the end of the show one of them actually reached out and touched my friends arm - awesome! 

This show is absolutely amazing. I was blown away from start to finish. Even though theres SO much going on and I didnt know where to look at some points, it was still incredible. Im a HUGE Beatles fan so it was fun to sing along. I wanted to get up and dance so bad, I had to force myself to stay in my seat. The costumes, props and the talent, OH MY GOD the talent. Wow, these people are just extraordinary, my goodness. 

I kept thinking to myself, how great would it be to actually be a performer in a Cirque du Soleil show?? I mean, come on its got to be the best job EVER. Note to self: perfect my roller skating skills and send application stat. 

If you want to see a show in Vegas trust me this is the one you dont want to miss. You wont be disappointed even if youre not the biggest Beatles fan. Youll love LOVE!!"
Beatles Love,"I got some tickets for this for my guy for his 21st and he thought this was the best show hed ever seen. For myself, I enjoyed, but I wasnt sure it was quite worth $300 for 1.5 hours of entertainment.

The theater is really small, and you really can see everything from anywhere in it, but if youre anything like me, youll read ten reviews that say that and still wanna sit as close as possible, but really, its a tiny theater. Probably why tickets are so much.

I will admit I didnt start really getting into the show until the Something sequence, which was very well choreographed, but about fifteen minutes in. My favorite, hands down, was the Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You sequence-- it was really surprising and such a cool effect, I would imagine, from both sides (we were above the effect).

Everybody loves the Beatles, and anyone who says they dont is just trying to be cool, but theyre dumb. How can you not like this show?

The While My Guitar Gently Weeps sequence was also pretty crazy and unexpected!

Overall, I was very entertained. I dont know if I would be willing to pay to see the show again, but I really enjoyed it. I also really want that silver Beetle thats in the show.

Oh, some of the characters were kind of weird and unexplainable. The Father McKenzie character? WTF? The guy all in white that kept pouring tea? The KKK? Kinda freaky circus-y. I guess thats what makes it Cirque.

Still incredible performances. Five stars!"
Beatles Love,"I am not a Beatles fan (I am sorry!  I didnt grow up here.  I was buried in books trying to pass all my exams.  Whos got the time to listen to music!).  Dont hate me but most of their songs just sound boring to me.  But my fiance is a huge fan of Beatles.  So being an excellent finance that I am, I decided to take him to the the Beatles Love for his birthday!  We both love the Cirque du Soleil shows, so I thought I would enjoy it if not the Beatles part.  

The show was fun and the dancing was cute, although I didnt understand the storyline and Allen had to explain to me.  (Ok, ok, you can call me dumb or whatever, I dont care,  But I thought I told you I didnt grow up here!)  In his review here http://www.yelp.com/biz_share?bizid=I00WeLc-Ou70ZJs1WfepiA&amp;reviewid=Y8hXsnxhevr78v7uIQ_A4Q&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAO_Tge7mRTQV4iOy3fg8fA he said they did a great job merging the original music with the performance.  I will take his words for it!  

This is not your typical Cirque du Soleil show with lots of acrobatics, but I did enjoy the show and I think you will, too!"
Beatles Love,"I, surprisingly, loved this show! I came in with no expectations and completely fell in LOVE with the show and the music. 

LOVE does not follow the typical story plot, but each song is a mini-story of its own, but somehow tends to lead itself to a semi-story that allowed the next song to easily transition itself to the LOVE story.

A GREAT show to come watch even if youre not a Beatles fan. Everyone in the production are a VERY talented group of individuals. I would definitely come back to watch it again. Yes, it was that good!"
Beatles Love,"How can you not like a tribute to The Beatles, one of the greatest rock bands to ever exist? The show features slightly remixed songs which the performers sang and danced to. It was enjoyable all around.

I think this is the coolest of the Cirque du Soleil shows, but maybe Im biased because I love John, Paul, George and Ringo. 

Next Cirque show Id see: O at Bellagio."
Beatles Love,"What can I say that hasnt been said already? It was a really good show. Seems like no matter where you sit, its a good time. This is tied with absinthe in my book. Must see"
Beatles Love,"I really dont the words to explain how AMAZING..no wait...INCREDIBLE...no no, the word is ASTONISHING.  okay i really dont have the words.  I fell in love with the show, i suggest anyone that likes even just one beatles song, to see this show.  the choreography was beautiful and amazing and totally goes with the whole beatles theme, look, or whatever you want to call it.  compared to other cirque de soleil shows, yea it doesnt have as much acrobatics, but seriously this show is more about the music.  

the only thing i would suggest is probably get a seat that is more in the back.  not only would you see the whole stage, but they also do this cool stunt with a huge white sheet, and for sure you want to see the whole thing, and not be under the white sheet haha.  

another suggestion...buy your ticket day of!!  my party and i spontaneously wanted to see it and looked around online for discounted tickets.  we found tickets that were half off, and were at amazing spots.  

i fell in love with the beatles again and i seriously have a new appreciation for them as well."
Beatles Love,"Just saw this show a few days ago and I am still in love with it!
Everything about the show was perfect.  It was a new experience compared to other Cirque shows that I have seen.  The other Cirque shows I have seen were traveling shows so the stage was not permanent.  I thought that the moving stage and people flying from all angles in this show was awesome.
There was not one boring act in the entire show!
I also like the fact that there was no intermission (1.5 hrs straight) 
Being that my friend and I were slightly younger than the other people in our area we were still moved to tears at the end..(the cute older woman next to us was recalling how much she was in love w/ the Beatles and how the show just reminded her of her younger days)

I would highly recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a great show!"
Beatles Love,"I was debating on which Vegas show to see and was compelled to go check this one out since I have a big Cirque fan and see all of their local shows.  Although I am not a big Beatles fan, I do know a few of their songs which helped a bit.

OBSERVATIONS:
- Unlike most of the Cirque shows, they did not have entertainment as you are waiting for the show to begin.
- If you are watching the show from the third level, you probably arent enjoying the show to its fullest.
- The show lasts for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Plan accordingly.

THE SHOW
- Overall, it was a good show.  Is it better than Mystere?  YES!!  (I fell asleep during that show, a first!)  Is it better than O?  NO!!!
- If you enjoy Beatles hits, then you will enjoy watching this show since its sort of like a real life music video.  Not a whole lot of really crazy stunts since its more of a theatrical interpretation of the music.  Think musical/music video.
- The highlight of the show featured the roller blading act.  That is all that I am going to say so that I dont spoil it for Yelpers.  In addition, there were two instances where confetti/streamers descended upon the crown.  One at the beginning for those in closer to the stage and at the very end.

TIP #1: If you plan to purchase ticket, click on this link to for a buy 1 ticket, get a second ticket for $25.  Offer valid for shows now until Oct. 31, 2009. http://mirage-cds.admission.com/adm/LOVE_25SP.htm

TIP #2: Do not plan to purchase tickets on row 1.  It looked like people were having a hard time absorbing the show since they were basically eye level with the stage just a few feet away.  Also, do not plan to purchase tickets in the 3 level."
Beatles Love,My fave show in Vegas after Jersey Boys. Vegas is great because it has shows and shopping like NYC. Great acrobats and ways to incorporate Beatles songs into visual art. A must-see for Beatles lovers and to have a good time when gambling aint your thing.
Beatles Love,"I have never seen a Cirque show, but I have seen FAR more than my fair share of Broadway performances throughout the country. 

While selecting which cirque show to attend, my first choice Ka was unfortunately dark on the chosen night. Damn. With my remaining options, I had it narrowed to Mystere and Love. I figured-you only live one-bite the bullet, pay the major ticket price, and go for the one with the music you know rocks.

This show was a feast for the eyes to be certain.  That said, it was also a visual clusterfuck.  Again, since I havent been to a Cirque show before it is difficult to know if theyre all like this, but it just didnt seem like there was the high quantity of high flying antics and acrobatics as those that Ive seen on TV.  

Most of the aerialists were in harnesses and were more doing ballet than what I would typically associate with aerialists.  

That said, the athletic ability of the artists is undeniable.  Absolutely stunning dancers and displays of strength.  The dancing and choreography was inspired, however I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. 

Since I was expecting more cirus and less Twyla Tharp, I felt a little bit burned by the ticket price.  It was exactly twice what Ive ever spent to see the best broadway productions with the most renound performers in the country and sometimes even in the world, and worked on by the most acclaimed choreographers.  

And really? I spend $140 and still get limited view seating?  The layout of the entire theater is in a way that no matter what, you will be in a position to miss some of the action that is happening. Im glad I paid the extra 30 bucks, however painful it was, to get these seats though-because the limited view balcony seats looked awful and like you wouldnt see anythign at all.

The sound design and light design were amazing.  Very innovative use of stagecraft like I would have expected from a cirque show.  All in all very enjoyable performance once I adjusted to seeing more of a ballet than a high flying show.

Favorite scenes included: Octupuss Garden, Here comes the Sun, Lady Madonna (the rainboots were precious) and the opening :)"
Beatles Love,"Ive never seen a show like this in Vegas!  Wow, just amazing.  The stunts were spectacular and music was great.  I love how they get the crowd involved.

We had balcony seats for $62.50 and when we got there they upgraded our seats to front row for free!!!"
Beatles Love,"It might put a dent in your wallet, but its well worth seeing this show. I was surprised at first to see a line to get in, but after the show I understand why. Im not a huge Beatles fan, but Im familiar with some of their songs and I just love music anyway and musically it didnt fail. Their show performance/stage props/choreography definitely blended nicely to Beatles tunes. Visually it was great too. That Yellow Submarine cartoon is wonderful... More power to you if you go under the influence."
Beatles Love,"Im not completely certain why this needed to be a Cirque du Soleil show.  The music is great; its the Beatles after all.  The costuming is trippy and some of the stunts are spectacular.

That being said, this is really a series of set piece stunts done without much narrative linkage one after another to a Beatles soundtrack.  Really, any troupe of acrobats could do that.

Its not like Ka.  Only Cirque du Soleil could do Ka.  All the athleticism, stunts and choreography is integral to the narrative and the telling of the story.

Its still good and worth seeing especially if you get Tix For Tonight, but its the weakest of the Cirque shows in Vegas. Best seats are the last four or five rows high in the bowl or low in the balcony."
Beatles Love,"The first word that comes to mind is Random, then why did we waste our money.  My husband and I are in our early 30s and have seen Mystere (loved), Ka (eh), La Reve (good), and now Beatles (disappointed).  They hardly had any acrobatics or moments where I was like wow.  Mostly it was poor dancing to the Beatles music with people dressed up in random outfits.  It did get 2 stars because the stage production and set-up including seating is great and they had 2 tricks in there that I liked.  All in all though, we were upset we wasted soo much money on this show."
Beatles Love,"Im not a Beatles fan, but I do love all Cirque productions.  This show tends to be focused more on the music and band versus your traditional Cirque acts.  I tend to favor the latter more than the former.  Nonetheless its a great show that is worth seeing.  I was able to get discounted tickets so the return on my value gives this a five-star rating.  Otherwise it would probably be a four and a half.  

I do warn... prepare for sensory overload.  There is so much going on throughout the show, from the lights, music, performances, etc. that its hard to focus and enjoy them all."
Beatles Love,"Ive been told that this show is different from other Cirque shows, more dancing and less acrobatics, but since its the only one Ive seen, I can only speak from experience.

The music sounds great, and its interesting to hear old favorites used to narrate a story.  It doesnt matter where you sit, as theres always so much going on on the stage that you cant possibly watch all of it at once anyway.  The combination of dancing, acrobatics, marionettes, lighting effects and video projections was mesmerizing.  Im glad I went.

My only complaint is that even though the stadium seating allows for a great view, the seats could be a little more comfortable than standard movie theater seats, though I forgot my discomfort by the end of the show."
Beatles Love,"The Beatles show is AMAZING!  I am a huge Beatles fan and I think that the Cirque du Soleil cast did an absolutely terrific job at performing to some of The Beatles most awesome songs ever.

I will admit that I cried and then I allowed a stranger to buy me the soundtrack afterward because I had no cash on me...I know, shame, shame

No regrets, Ill go back for sure."
Beatles Love,"Great show. We went for Valentines Day weekend, and were right next to where the performers walk in and out!

The music was amazing. The dancing was great. It was not as acrobatic as most Cirque du Soleil shows, but it was much more fun! I wanted to sing and dance the whole show.

Wonderfully done!!!"
Beatles Love,Absolutely amazing!! Worth every penny! Ive seen every Cirque in Vegas and this is my favorite
Beatles Love,"Loved it.
Id like to see it again and again and again and again.

I didnt want it to end.

We were probably the furthest seats possible, and I wasnt too disappointed.  We were able to see the stage in its entirety, which is something the front rows probably didnt get to experience.

Loved it.
Next time I will probably try and get an aisle closer seat though...

Its totally worth the money."
Beatles Love,"I saw one of the first Cirque du Soleil shows when it first made its way to Vegas. I remember being blown away by it.

While there were a lot of neat things in this show and the music composition was great. I just wasnt blown away with this show. But I just felt the show was all over the place with its themes.

I would only recommend it if you are a fan of the Beatles, otherwise I would go see a different Cirque show."
Beatles Love,"I think the bottom line on this show is that, if youre a Beatles fan, youll LOVE this show.  If youre not, then its about a 50/50 proposition.  

My GF and I went this past Saturday and had a BLAST.  We were singing along the entire time and enjoying the show.  There were definitely people in the crowd who didnt appear to be enjoying the show quite as much as we were, but thats not saying much.  

Granted, the show was a bit like an acid trip, but the great music mixed in with the show made it an awesome experience.  If youre a Beatles fan, this is a show that is not to be missed."
Beatles Love,Best Cirque du Soleil show!!!  It was entertaining the entire time even after watching it for my fourth time!  Definitely a must see especially if you are a Beatles fan.
Beatles Love,"I LOVED THIS SHOW! Such a great way to spend my b-day. I had no real expectations although I had seen circque shows before, not in Vegas though. This was an amazing theatre, amazing sound, amazing stage, amazing music, amazing dance, everything!! really....I would see it again and maybe a couple more times after that. We had cheap seats but there are no bad seats in the house. OK, I admit it,  those Kanooks really know how to put on a show. 

Here is my next cirque idea a bob marley cirque it could be called Kaya - How cool would that be?"
Beatles Love,"I do love the Beatles music and have been wanting to see this show for some time however the price of $167 plus for the best seats is a bit much. The only other Cirque du Soleil show we saw was Zumanity and I thought that was good so I was blow away by this one. 

We were in section 200 row N middle row seats so had a great view of the stages. I thought the dancing and acrobats were amazing. the skaters were awesome. chirography was excellent. 

I was a bit confused about why the KKK was in the show. another puzzling moment was 1/4 of the audience being covered by the parachute/ bed sheet, what was up with that? 

My favorite was Hey Jude, love that song! 

Id say this is one if not the best shows that Ive seen. 

Tip: check with the concierge for 1/2 price tickets on the day of the show. 
Also the souvenirs are expensive $10.00 for a shot glass, $42.00 for a Womens blouse. $25.00 hat, $30 DVD"
Beatles Love,While I did not see the show my review is for the staff at the box office.  I wanted to treat my parents for their 45th wedding anniv and wanted to get tickets to the LOVE show.  The box office staff was very helpful in helping me pick the best day and seats for the show.  He helped me get a good price and told me where to drop off my parents.  The line to buy tickets was fast and the staff was great.
Beatles Love,"we have seen this show twice using the locals 2 for 99 buck deal.  We are in the nosebleed seats, but seriously, there really isnt a bad seat in this theatre. Great show, obviously great soundtrack, these people dance their hearts out, will see again in the future!!!"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles are my favorite group of all time, so I expected AMAZING! I had already heard the soundtrack a few times, so I was a huge fan of that specifically going in. I loved that George Harrison composed the whole complication and was super stoked to come. In fact, it was the sole reason I came to Vegas after having not been here since I was 11. I am now 34 and knew that The Beatles would be the only thing to make me go there as an adult. Its true, there seemed to be no bad seats and the overall ambiance was pretty cool looking. We sat like 7 seats from the stage. The shows performance did not match the soundtrack, however. It was lacking in many areas and beyond slow for at least 60% of it. The creepy as all get out little Beatles with blank faces was unnecessary and freaky and the Blackbird scene was probably one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. Totally took away from the beautiful song. There was nothing about the show that was worth $127! That is what the person who bought my ticket paid. It was worth about $80 and that;s what I would pay if I ever went again. I would also never sit near the stage again because I do not enjoy massive sheets dragging over my head for 5 minutes, which is what happens if you sit near the first 20 rows or so. If you went in with a hair style, you will leave those rows void of one. 
Go for the soundtrack and overall show, but dont pay more than $80. 
5 stars for the soundtrack and 3 for the performances."
Beatles Love,What is there to say? Ive been wanting to see it for years and loved it! Fantastic interesting stunts all played out to Beatles music. Beautiful!
Beatles Love,"There is not much to say. The show was amazing, completely whimsical, took my husband and I out of our everyday lives and placed us in a fantasy. I have seen other cirque de soleil shows, but I truly enjoyed this. 

Amazing a MUST SEE!"
Beatles Love,Love was my bf and Is first Cirque show! Before getting free tickets for this show I always wanted to see it. I dont know how other cirque shows are but Love makes you feel like youre a part of the show by being more interactive. We got free upgrades to front row which was kind of difficult to catch everything that was going on stage but I still enjoyed it. Acrobatics were amazing! Cant wait to see another cirque show.
Beatles Love,"Hard to lose with such a great soundtrack.  This is a really fun show that is perfectly paced.  It is more visually spectacular than acrobatically superior, though there are smatterings of athletic prowess that will not fail to amaze.  Come without any preconceptions of what a Cirque show should be and Id be incredibly surprised -- actually, shocked -- if you fail to enjoy yourself.  In fact, if this occurs, write to me and explain how you came to be so humorless."
Beatles Love,"Nothing Ive seen in any genre of live entertainment comes close to this truly stunning production.  I was moved beyond words throughout the show and had a lump in my throat much of the time. Ive wanted to see this show since it started, and I finally had the chance as it celebrates five years at the Mirage.  I will absolutely see it again, and maybe more than that.  Breathtakingly creative in so many ways, a fantastic tribute to the songwriting genius of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, and a tremendous sensory experience that left my wife and me wishing it wouldnt end.  We were left almost speechless by what we experienced in the customized room designed especially to pull off this show.

The naysayers here were either drunk or have no affinity for the phenomenon that was The Beatles.  If you want to be absolutely blown away by a live production, go see this show.  We sat in row K in gold circle seats that were worth every penny.  Was it a classic Cirque show?  I have no idea and I couldnt care less.  Was it unbelievably great as a piece of multi-media and live performance art?  Absolutely! 

I cant wait to see it again."
Beatles Love,"Being a huge Beatles fan growing up, I was so excited to hear that Cirque made a Beatles tribute show.

Afterwards, having caught a glimpse of the show on The Tonight Show,  I was so unimpressed, I had been to Vegas about 20 times since it openned at had absolutely no desire to see it. 

This last trip last weekend, we had tickets to Jersey Boys saturday night, and nothing planned Friday night, so we decided to go at the last minute.  We managed to get really nice seats the second level up.

From the time the MC came out to the time of the last curtain call, I was simply amazed at what they did to the music.

Lucy in the Sky was fantastic, Something and Come Together were outstanding.  Seriously never a dull moment. 

I would definitly not go if you werent atleast interested in the Beatles, and seriously boo to those who rated the show down because people werent jumping 200 ft in the air?  This show definitly didnt need it."
Beatles Love,"yes, i know this is a low review for this show, but i think it will actually help others like myself. i agree with another reviewer completely that this is definitely more of a beatles show than a cirque show. if you are not a huge beatles fan, i think some of the other cirque shows ive seen are much more impressive, especially O. 
Although I like the Beatles, I dont think I was able to appreciate the history as much. I was definitely one of the younger folks at the show and I am 35. 
Everything was good, just not great for me. Also, i felt like the show lacked focus. You  often dont know where you should be looking because theres so much going on everywhere. but i think thats so all the seats have something to look at.

all in all, a good show, but I think you need to really appreciate the Beatles for it to be great."
Beatles Love,"Ten year wedding anniversary spent in Vegas and out of all the shows around, this seemed the most appropriate.  It was one of the best choices Ive made in all my ten years of marriage HAHAHA!!!  I L-O-V-E-D it!

Best seats in my opinion are the top 5 rows.  NOT the balcony seating though.  I guess you might call it orchestra?  Reasoning?  There is a sequence in the show where they cover the audience with a HUGE sheet.  It has this ripple effect and looks so awesome.  Also when the sheet gets pulled down into the stage it looks AMAZING, almost like its water going down a sink.  To miss that because the sheet is covering you I think cheats you out of that experience.  BTW, if you happen to be at the edge of the sheet-DO NOT HOLD ON TO IT!!!!!  The sheet is supposed to wave loosely.  People were trying to grab onto it like it was a parachute.  There are ushers that will do this job so dont try to take over for them!  The stage is 360 degree and performers come in from above, down the stairs, at the sides and from underneath.  Like I said, top five rows of orchestra seating are the best IMO.

SAVE YOUR CONFIRMATION INFO!!!  There was a major computer glitch during my show and I picked up my tickets via will call.  But luckily I bought via TicketMaster and those tickets are printed out and boxed.  I guess tickets through the hotels box office arent.  There was some confusion as to where people were sitting.

The gift shop was amazing.  Lots of Junk Food brand Beatles shirts that Ive never seen before.  Expensive though, of course."
Beatles Love,"I love this show!! All I can say is, if you LOVE the Beatles,, you will LOVE this show! Not much acrobatics for this show but could they perform!! WoWWWW! They danced like no tomorrow and the costumes were out of this world. I felt like I was in the 60s era. The performers could not have done it better. It is hard to dance certain moves to Beatles Rhythm but the Cirque definitely did it!  I will definitely see it again. Well worth the $115!"
Beatles Love,"Love is a great Cirque du Soleil show though I have to admit that I didnt just fall head over heels.

The acrobatics are wonderful and the costumes are really cute.  If you like Beatles music of course you will relish this show.  Having said that you really have to be into costumes and props to fully appreciate this performance.  This theatre used to be used for the Siegfried and Roy lion show and Cirque du Soleil spent a LOT of money transforming the venue and creating a multi million dollar sound system (with the help of one of the Beatles) to make sure there would be optimal sound for the experience.  The Beatles LOVE is meant to tell a story so it is a full theatrical experience all the way home.  Very cute and fun but if you are dying to pick just one Cirque show in Vegas to go see dont go here first unless you are a die hard Beatles fan."
Beatles Love,"The hands-down greatest rock band of all time combined with Cirque? Are you kidding me?? I was so excited to see this show I almost peed my pants. My gf got us tix to see it for Valentines Day (I know, awww) and the first 20 minutes of the show was all I expected and more. Dreamy sequences with hints of characters from the songs I grew up listening to..it was amazing. I sung along with every track and darted my eyes around the stage so I wouldnt miss anything. I bought the soundtrack before seeing the show so I sort of knew what to expect music wise (awesome soundtrack btw; remixing the Beatles is like sacrilege but not in this case).

The only problem was that 20 minutes in, some jackass pulled the fire alarm...and the show grinded...to....a.....halt. The fire sprinklers over one of the sections starting going off, so they had to evacuate everyone. Unfortunately we never got to see the rest of the show, but we got a refund and were comped a meal and VIP seating after I called and bitched. Those 20 minutes sure were spectacular though.

*** Update 12/18/07: We finally made it back to see this show again. The whole time we were praying another fire alarm wouldnt go off, and we actually made it thru the whole show! LOVEd it, wouldnt change a thing. Not as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows from what Ive heard, but the visuals combined with the timeless tracks is pure gold. Big ups to whoever did the motion graphics on the screens as well."
Beatles Love,"The newest in the Cirque de Soleil empire, this show is based on the music of The Beatles.  If you want acrobatics and humor, see Mystere.  If you want great acrobatics with a watery theme, see O (or Le Rve).  If you want acrobatics and great technical feats, see K.  If you love Beatles music, see Love.

I enjoyed Love because I like Beatles music.  Yes, there are some pretty interesting acrobatics, but the heart of the show is the music.  The theater has an excellent sound system, and the choreography does a good job of supporting the music.

Hint: the seats closest to the stage are so close that it can be difficult to take in some of the acrobatics.  I sat in front and enjoyed it a lot, but the seats about 6 or 7 rows back are probably better."
Beatles Love,"If you like their music (and if you dont youre unamerican), then get a huge $20 ( 4 shot) drink, and enjoy the show. Had a great time. We might have been the youngest in our row by about 20-30 years, but everyone was having a great time."
Beatles Love,"I saw it a few days ago with my girlfriend and her coworkers. Actually, it was my second time, so I was worried that I might find it boring. Quite the contrary, its an experience that will not get old. The pageantry and creativity thats made Cirque du Soleil one of the top Vegas shows is there. So if youve seen O, KA, Zumanity, or the local Kooza-Corteo shows, youll be in for a treat.
If you are a hardcore fan of the Beatles, rock, musicals, etc., this is also the show for you. The visuals are incredible, as is the music. Original Abbey Road recordings made this one of the best values for a show in Vegas. Id highly recommend it!!!"
Beatles Love,"What a show!  Cirque du Soleil is amazing.  The Beatles are amazing.  So do you get when you add the two together?  Brilliance, thats what. 

Our seats were right in the middle of our section, but sitting around the circular stage area (and I say stage because the whole area transforms throughout the show, with people jumping and dangling from all sides) there seems to be no bad seat.  This was like nothing I had ever seen before.  The Beatles songs selected were among my favorites.

If you arent a Beatles fan already this will probably turn you into one!"
Beatles Love,"Yes! I have completed my mission to watch all the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas! And I got to complete it with Hubby on our anniversary and special day. Very fitting that we saw the show named after Love. I planned it that way of course.

We had pretty good seats, and both Hubby and I agreed that we liked the layout of the theater. Its different from other shows because the audience is seated all around the stage instead of only facing the stage in a half circle. Furthermore, it practically ensures that everyone gets a good view of the show. Because of the set up of the theater, I felt physically closer to the performers and as a result I felt more connected to the whole performance. I also really liked the fact that there were parts of the show that involved participation by the whole audience.

Overall, I really liked the show. The only con is I love seeing acrobatics, but this show has less acrobatics than other Cirque shows, such as Mystere."
Beatles Love,"Not the best Cirque du Soleil show. It was actually disappointing, I dont believe the best Beatles songs were chosen. Some of the songs I had never even heard of. I honestly believe the best part was the beginning. Hardly any acrobat acts and the little that they did perform, I had seen at other shows and were performed better.  Too expensive and not worth it."
Beatles Love,"I loved this show, but I can understand that its also not for everyone.  

But, Ill cover the good news before the bad.  The theater was great, and I dont think it was possible that there was a bad seat in the house.  There were speakers in the backs of the seat headrests as well as in the front, so they didnt have to blast the volume to make it audible by all.  Just the detail that was put into the show was amazing, and it was visually a work of art.  They also incorporated some real candid recordings of the Beatles into the show and had a lot of great sub-stories to build on the main theme.  The spread of songs was good as some were from their pop days and some from their 70s trip days.  Im more familiar with the pop songs, but enjoyed everything.

Ive never seen any other Vegas shows or Cirque shows, but Ive heard a lot of them contain a lot of action and stunts.  LOVE is much more about the acrobatics than death-defying stunts.  

So, if youre ok with watching a show thats not based on excessive stunts and you dont expect the whole show to be pop Beatles, I think youll definitely love this show."
Beatles Love,These performers have mastered the craft of making difficult and dangerous stunts look remarkably easy.  The score and art direction of this show is the best Ive seen.  The only complaint is that I need to return at least twice more to catch all of the action!
Beatles Love,"If you go expecting a typical Cirque du Soleil show (if there even is such a thing), you may be disappointed. If you love the Beatles and grew up with their music on your HiFi and/or iPod... you are in for a treat. For me, Harrisons Guitar Gently Weeps and Ringos Octopus Garden were highlights.

During Something, argueably Harrisons best song as a Beatle, I wondered how such choreography could even be conceived much less performed flawlessly. Four women, in turn, elegantly float to and from the heights in an aerial ballet, moving in and out of the arms of the male dancer at center stage. It was classy, sensual, and graceful. 

Make sure you follow Sara Os seating instructions. Have fun!"
Beatles Love,The best Cirque show Ive seen......  The special effects and use of props were AMAZING!  You will not be disapointed!
Beatles Love,Just see it..plain and simple. There arent words to adequately explain it so no reason to try.
Beatles Love,"We won tickets for the dinner and show the other night.  The show was pretty good.  I love The Beatles and thought the coreography, stunts, dance and visuals complimented the music nicely.  Not as acrobatic as I had anticipated, though.

One thing about the seating is the lack of leg room.  Im 57 and it was snug, so I feel bad for anyone who is much taller than me, having to sit there for 90 minutes.  I did notice that one of the rows in the back had more leg room and the chairs were more like recliners that could swivel.  How nice for those people!

No photos are permitted in the auditorium, they do have a gift shop with tons of beatles stuff, and there is also a concession stand.  

I think if youre a Beatles fan, you should definitely check it out."
Beatles Love,"Such an incredible experience for the senses. from the moment it starts youre almost constantly bombarded with things to look at. the costumes and MUSIC accompany the visuals so well you cant help but smile.  

its almost impossible to go in expecting to hear all of your favorite beatles songs because theres so freaking many but the show does a good job of picking the hits most people should know. 

we got our tickets from tix4tonight ($112 after fees) and when we got to the box office they gave us the option of either front row or 15th row and we chose the front row.  i think theres so much going on that you might miss things if you sit too close. that said i think between the 5th and 10th row would probably be perfect.

we saw O last time we were in vegas which happened to be my first cirque show. the show was utterly boring and just weird. its from the same guy who did the celine dion show so he just seems to throw in random shit to make things look artsy or something. maybe its just over my head or whatever but from the second Love starts its a PARTY and you just feel awesome. walking out of the theater we were buzzing about how great it was while walking out of O we were wondering why we just wasted so much money.  

the stunts and acrobatics probably would have been more difficult and probably are in other cirque shows but this show must be seen for the overall experience."
Beatles Love,"Really enjoyed Love, but of course you really have to like the Beatles. Definitely a great show, but you need good seats to see everything."
Beatles Love,"Cirque du Soleil creates another amazing and fun show.  Using music from the Beatles, you cant help but walk out of the show feeling good.  Youll get standing up cheering and applauding the performers by the end of the show.  

The interesting thing is, Love isnt so heavily dependent on acrobatics as the other Cirque shows.  This one focuses more on various styles of dance along with what I can only describe as aerial dance/acrobatics.  You still cant help but be amazed by what these performers can do.

As with most Cirque du Soleil shows, dont worry about the front row seats.  Sitting further back will give you a better vantage point to see everything going on on statge."
Beatles Love,"This is the BEST Cirque show in Vegas!! Any seat is a good one, so dont overspend.  90 minutes of amazing and varied entertainment set to the BEST music.  The show starts out great and climbs from there until youre out of your seat standing and clapping at the end.  Yes, its pricey--but there are deals if you check Mandalays website directly, or one of the Vegas ticket deal websites (even Tix4tonight can help.) Dont miss this one--kids and adults will be entertained!"
Beatles Love,"Is it possible to have a big fat smile on your face for 95 minutes?  I think so!  I have now seen 3 Cirque Du Soleil shows and LOVE was actually my first.  LOVE popped my cherry and I compare every other CDS show it and nothing can beat it.  I mean, a show with just music from The Beatles?  

Everything was awesome from the walkway into the show, the staff dressed up in show attire, the drinks [and the names of the drinks], the gift shop, and oh wait, let me give some props to the show itself too.  From the first minute when the drapes fall to the standing ovation at the finale, it was just CDS bliss.  Some acts were simply beautiful, others were fun and cool.  I think it was Octopus Garden where a huge white sheet was pulled across the audience in all directions and we happened to sit at the row where the sheets ended, so as the sheets were moving up and down, I mean....best seats in the house, it was so pretty!  

I still listen to the soundtrack to this day and it makes me happy.  I mean, as crazy as it sounds, I would actually go see this show again.  If you enjoy/like/love The Beatles, you cannot miss this show!  Any seat is a good seat."
Beatles Love,"I was a little worried about sitting too far since I wasnt in the lowest section, but when we got there I realized it was the perfect location. Not too close or too far from stage. Actually all the seats seem like a good location. 

What I liked about this Cirque du Soleil show more than others is that its a tribute to the Beatles. People can relate to the Beatles, so it was a delight when certain songs came on and Id hear people around me singing, humming, or clapping along. Its very interactive in that sense. The performances and effects were mesmorizing. I had a soft spot for the lonely clown, who also came out to entertain us before the show started.  

This show was all about having fun. Its the most light hearted Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen."
Beatles Love,"ONE WORD THAT APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBES LOVE....GROOVY!!!!

From the moment when we walked up to the Box Office, I felt as if I was being transported into an Austin Powers Movie...the bright colors, the British flag, the dressed up cadettes that greet you.

As other yelpers have discussed. This is definitely different than other Cirque shows because werent too much acrobatics. If you want and expect that, I suggest watching another show. Since theres a bunch of 4 and 5 star reviews, Im guessing most people are open minded. It was more a variety show with all types of dance (hip hop, breaking, modern, and artistic) to various Beatles songs. It was honestly kind of weird to have roller blades on ramps....but okay....Even though I am not that big of a Beatles fan, I still knew alot of the songs. I was swaying my head back and forth during a good majority of the show.  I honestly didnt get every scene....a bit artsy and way out there for me (but I guess you dont have to)....MAN OH MAN THE VISUAL EFFECTS WERE AMAZING!!!...MY FAVORITE SCENE WAS THE JELLYFISH SCENE.

The only main downside to the show was that I actually got dizzy during the show moving my head from one thing to another. We sat up front thinking that the closer, the better but there was so many things happening all at once. I was trying to see everything and moving my head all over the place.

SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS SHOW FROM A DISTANCE IN ORDER TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. ALSO TRY TO GET DISCOUNTS ANY WAY YOU CAN...THIS IS A REAL EXPENSIVE SHOW ESPECIALLY TO SIT UP FRONT (AT ABOUT $170/SEAT....OUCH!!!....BUT THANKS TO MY BF I DIDNT HAVE TO DIG DEEP INTO THE POCKETS). THERE PROBABLY ISNT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE....SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE CHEAPER SEATS.  If you know anyone that lives in Vegas, residents get approximately 1/2 off tickets.

Although this isnt my favorite Cirque Show, I overall still had a fun time.

Beatles Love,"hm..............

my last trip to vegas was with my dad and sister who was visting me from nyc.. so we decided to watch a show.. but the only shows that were playing sunday night werent that great.. this was the best pick... i dunno if it was us... (being super tired from the short trip stay at vegas) or the show being super..... uhmm... how should i put it nicely... i fell asleep... we all did.. :(

i thought..... hm... we spent about 130$ for each ticket... and fell asleep..... the last time i was in nyc.... i was really really tired after helping my sister move into her fabulous apt in manhattan.. and unpacking everything.. my sister had already purchased student tickets in the morning for about 26.50$ and i really didnt want to watch jersey boys... i thought what is that about? ew... but we went there super tired... but omgggg the show was soooo amazing that it actually woke me up.. so my point is.. no matter how tired i am... if a show is as good as they say it is... you wont fall asleep! 

i dont reccomend anyone to watch this... super boring.. :) but if your okay with pay over 100 for each ticket and falling asleep... then be my guest!"
Beatles Love,"Ok...I was kinda disappointed.  I guess I expected more acrobatics, and more humor, and not sooooo much dancing.  At least now I know, and will be sure to hit up pretty much any OTHER Cirque show, or Le Reve, next time Im in Vegas."
Beatles Love,"In a word, magical.

This is perhaps the best live theater I have experienced over and beyond 50 concerts and 30 musical shows.  Though Cirque circus acts are toned down in comparison some of their top shows (O, Alegria, Kooza), the staging in this $100M theater is unparalleled.

Beatles LOVE is intimate, moving, humorous, engrossing, engaging, empowering, and loving.  Apple Corp has co-produced no other show, so you know interpretations are those of the four legends.  Martin and Champagne bring you what is meant to be.

At times I was personally overpowered with emotion, the music and theater and performers are so gripping.  Truly a magical experience like no other!"
Beatles Love,"Wow...this show brought up every emotion in me from my first crush, to passionate love, to the pain of losing a parent, and then went on to fill my heart with happiness and joy. The music, the stage set up, the performers...all amazing. I love The Beatles but I think any person would like this show. Warning: beware of the bars Beatles themed drinks. They are large (comes with a souvenir cup) and you will almost pee your pants because you will refuse to miss one second of the show. I pretty much ran in heels as soon as I could escape the exiting crowd. :P Also, go to the souvenir shop earlier in the day to avoid the after show crowd."
Beatles Love,"The last time that we were in Vegas we saw Ka which was awesome and amazing.  Love was just ok.  I really wanted to LOVE it but it was just eh.  The music was great because it was The Beatles and the acrobatics left me thinking how could anyone do that!!!  I just didnt like the interpretations of the songs.  I really hated Lady Madonna.  My husband said wow you really dont clap for anyone tapdancing.

So you get to hear different versions of Beatles songs which was cool.  Some parts of the show were just creepy or it could have been that I was just really tired.  I dunno.

On the Mirage website you can get 25% of tickets if you go during the week.  We were sitting up top and had a great view as it is a small theater in the round."
Beatles Love,"Absolutely amazing! It was my first Cirque show in Vegas (saw a traveling show once in my home city) and it blew my mind. The music was wonderful, the costumes were fantastic. It was just such a cool, fun experience. We were in the 5th row and had great seats!"
Beatles Love,"I agree with all the other reviews. Its a great show, intimate setting, seats are great no matter where you are sitting.  This was my first cirque show and the one thing you have to remember is this show is a lot like the movie 2001 space odyssey  Everyone interprets this show (and other cirque shows) differently.  Throughout the show youre like OOOOH and OHHH and look at that.  but when its over, and you go home and try to describe the show and what you saw is indescribable.  That movie was the same way.  You finish the show or the movie and you cant put into words what you saw/experienced.  Even if you see the show with someone, each of you will have a different reaction to what you saw and experienced.  Its very kewl and I recommend this show to everyone."
Beatles Love,"4th time seeing the show and it has been phenomenal every single time. Cirque is never a let down, and worth every penny! If you are looking to be entertained and have a lifetime memory, see the Beatles Love show!!"
Beatles Love,Crazy good.  Best cirque show yet!  The music was well done and speakers in the headrests of the stadium seat helped drown out the lady singing along in the seat next to us.  Non stop dancing and so many costumes to look at it was hard to take it all in.  Beautiful acrobatics nicely choreographed to complement the Beatles tunes!  Well worth the price of admission.  This was the highlight of our Vegas week.
Beatles Love,"Ive seen probably a dozen of Cirque shows - most in Vegas, a few traveling, but this one has a special spot for me as I do love The Beatles and their music sounds as fresh as it probably was for audiences when they started out over 50 years ago - I have seen it 3 times now and I would say Id go back and see it another 3 times, it is that good.  High energy, visually spectacular, with a soundtrack of songs that are mashed together so well, you would have thought they were originally written that way.  Kudos to all the performers who give it their all each and every time we have seen this show.  We elected for front row seats this trip so we could see what was going on under the big sheet the kids on the bed are riding on during one number - well nothing going on under the sheets, so if you think you are missing something under there, you are not - but what you do get in a close up of this show is the expressions on the faces, the sheer majesty of the dancers and the choreography that make this such a wonderful evening of entertainment.  The absolute best of everything that is Cirque du Soleil and The Beatles.  i dare you not to come away pleased."
Beatles Love,"Great show, especially if youre a Beatles fan! When I compare it to shows like O or Le Reve, those shows definitely have more of the WOW factor. All the great Beatles songs were featured during the show, and of course, who can go wrong with the Cirque du Soleil visuals! WOW!

Still a must see when youre in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"I love the Beatles and was delighted that my sweetheart took me for my birthday.  Hed already seen it and had my so pumped up that I expected something different, something better and more amazing but I totally enjoyed what I saw.   We had great seats and the show is constantly moving so make sure you look ALL around or you can miss someting like an acrobat or great costumes, its a feast for the eyes and ears!  And I was glad that it was orginial Beatles music!"
Beatles Love,A great show that incorporates Beatles music and a display of acrobatic and visual display. I sat in the front row and you almost feel like youre part of the show. I like the use of Converse shoes on all if not most of the performers. Also the use of the Volkswagon Beetle is stupendous. Would love to see this show a little more sober.
Beatles Love,One of the most beautiful things Ive seen in my life. Stunningly gorgeous performances and complimented the timeless genius that are the Beatles more perfectly than I could have ever imagined. I am dying to see it again already - dont leave Vegas without seeing this show.
Beatles Love,"There are no words! But if I had to find some to describe this experience they would have to be...AMAZING, EXTRAORDINARY, BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING, AWE INSPIRING! My heart starts beating faster just thinking about it! The music surrounds you and brings you back in time. I felt absolutely transported in to the world as the Beatles knew it. There were times when I had tears in my eyes and then a moment later I would be smiling ear to ear. There were shouts from the crowd of fantastic, amazing and did you just see that!! and all I could think was, I cant believe my eyes. 
I had never been to a Cirque du Soleil before but if the rest are anything like this I will be going as much as I can. 
If you like the Beatles than you will LOVE, LOVE."
Beatles Love,"LOVE was a chaotically organized, beautiful mess.  I LOVED it! Im huge Beatles fans and really appreciate the way the LOVE album was portrayed. Now, this is NOT your typical Cirque show. I was expecting many more jaw-dropping acrobatics and not so much dancing and galloping about, but the makeup, costumes, choreography and, of course, music went so well together, it didnt really matter. 

I HIGHLY recommend sitting in the upper level. Not only are they much cheaper but you get to see EVERYTHING that is going on."
Beatles Love,Our show had a 15 minute delay in the middle due to technical issues and it was still one of the best shows I have ever seen. It does help to be more than a casual fan of the Beatles but even a passing fan will enjoy the spectical.
Beatles Love,"I got a great deal for this show at travel zoo, I just picked the cheapest tickets I could find, we were seated way up there in the nosebleed section, but our view of the show was still amazing. There is no bad seat in the theater! Overall it was a good show. As like most cirque shows, it is mainly visual, and the problem with that for me is that I am more auditory. I like it when a show can get you engaged emotionally. They played a lot of popular Beatles songs as well as some not so popular ones. I think the show was pretty long, I have to admit I fell asleep, again..as I also did that when I saw le reve...maybe am just not a huge cirque fan, since I am more engaged when there is actual singing and an actual storyline, like broadway shows etc. I prefer shows that will please you mentally, visually &amp; auditory, but if visual stimulation is enough for you, this show should be good. The Performance was flawless though and the seats &amp; theater was really nice."
Beatles Love,"It was my first Vegas show (if you dont count String Cheese Incident at the Aladdin . . . ) and also my first Cirque de Soleil experience.

It was extremely cool.  Im a big fan of Beatles music, so that helped a lot.  But the surrealistic choreography, stunts, costumes, and use of space by the characters and props created a very impressive, absorbing event.  The sound quality and visuals are crisp.  

A long list of songs unfolds as a story, and if I hadnt consumed a lot of vodka and some gin on a relatively empty stomach in the hours leading up to the show, I probably would have followed all of the symbolism more effortlessly.  

I recommend it highly!"
Beatles Love,"WOW! 
Ok so I never thought I would see something new at a Cirque show. This was a last minute decision to join to join them at this show and it was such the right decision. 
Its like an acid trip but without the drugs! so beautiful, so enchanting, so trippy! Who dreams up this stuff? 
Totally worth every dollar!
If I had only one show to see in Vegas while I was here, this would be it!"
Beatles Love,"4.5 stars.

A friend took me for my birthday in 07 and it was indeed excellent.

You HAVE to be a Beatles fan to love LOVE.
The people who rated it so poorly didnt sound like they even knew what the Beatles were about.

They do a great job interpreting the songs with the art/movements/props.

Everything is Beatles-esque, from the ushers to the gift shop.

I didnt pay for my ticket, but 3rd row tickets were $165.

I know shows on the Strip are all pretty expensive, but to be honest...Id rather spend my money seeing this show time and time again than try out some of these other shows.

My favorite part was when they had the white sheet go over everyone because we all felt connected as we laughed hysterically. They projected images of the yellow submarine on the sheet and it was sucked back into this floating bed with a younger version of paul, ringo, john and george sitting on it.

They have some pretty attractive people in the show.
Yeeeeees they do.

Not the typical artsy-fartsy Cirque show. Its thought out and very well done. Must see!"
Beatles Love,"The Beatles Love Show was pretty good.  Went with two other couples and everyone seemed to enjoy the whole show, from the flying around, acrobatic moves, to of course, the Beatles music they performed to.  This is definitely a show to watch in Vegas for all ages.

Overall, good show, okay price to watch."
Beatles Love,"We first saw this show in 2008 and was impressed then.  Last evening we saw it again and swore that there have been changes to the program in two years, but we were highly impressed again.  The music and the visuals were what we liked the first time, especially the color and the energy.  I didnt think the sound system was especially loud and I was sitting in Section 200.  

One strange event happened right in front of us when the guy in front of us was read the riot act by the usher for apparently using the flash on his camera during the performance.  The usher stood in front of the seated gent and gave him the what-for for what seemed to have been at least three minutes.  Guess it taught him a lesson.

One hint for will call customers:  make sure you get in line in front of the ticket office at least 45 minutes before the show as the lines can be a mix of will calls and new ticket buyers.  We stood in line for about 30 minutes but the actually process of providing appropriate identification and obtaining the tickets only took a couple of minutes.

Great show!  Want to see it again in a couple of years and hope it gets on the road in the not too distant future."
Beatles Love,"I was so excited to watch this show, not just because Im a huge fan of the Beatles but every Cirque show I have seen was amazing. This one, not so much. Maybe it was our seating (balcony) but every angle is supposed to be great and has been in my past experience. I think my main problem with this show is that there was so many interpretive dancing portions which I felt was blah. And really, what was up with the guy with the flowers? There were some magical moments of the show, dont get me wrong, but if I wanted to watch an interpretive dance music video, I wouldve gotten tickets to the Jabbawockees instead."
Beatles Love,"A very, very, very good Cirque du Soleil production. Completely worth the $165 admission (we had mid-theater section seats, not too far, but not too close).

The stage setup and audience seating was not what I expected it to be. The audience surrounds the stage from all sides (and the stage itself has a very strange shape), and compared to the KA and O theaters, its not as big. But it works very well for all the performances and choreography.

Some neat factors about this stage, theater, and production:

1. Imbedded in the back of each seat is a sound system speaker which is designed to provide a feel it in your bones surround sound effect for each and every single paying audience member. First time Ive been to a theater that has this kind of system implemented.

2. Lots of trippy and wow visual effects in a few of the numbers (not going to give any away).

The show starts off a bit slow the first few opening minutes, which adds to the build up if youre a first time audience member. Then it explodes into a collection of non-stop high energy performances from that point until the end...filled with your traditional wacky Cirque set pieces and performers mixed with 60s flair.

I relished every single minute of this show. Super entertaining.

Highly recommended to any high-budget production show fans or anybody that has enjoyed other Cirque du Soleil shows."
Beatles Love,"I love the Beatles and you did me proud Cirque du Soleil.  i did not like the Lady Madonna segment.  I always had another vision in my head for this song, but the way they did it, was kind of un-PC. Now, Ill always think back the the pregnant Fro haird girl dancing around in rags when I hear this song. 
I DID love the Day in the LIFE.  Are you kidding me???
I DIE!
The car exploding- the woman flying around on a red scarf - 
Yeah- breathtaking to say the least- 
You do not want to sit in the front row. This is another show that you need to sit back further to catch everything. (Not too far back) but still- enough to see things in widescreen as i explained in my O review. 
Tickets for these shows are around 150-250.00  Youd be better off getting the 150.00-175.00 seats.  Youll thank me later.  There is so much to see, and the colors and costumes are visually stimulating. 
Great show.... Id rate this the second best one they have...
Still O tops this show by a landslide.."
Beatles Love,"Im surprised at the one and two star reviews of this show... either these people arent Beatles fans, in which case, Id ask why theyd go to a show that is a tribute to the Beatles in the first place, or the symbolism of the performance in relationship to the music alluded them.

Granted, Im sure I didnt fully grasp *all* the symbolism myself, but it was definitely food for thought and a lot of fun to see how Cirque interpreted Beatles music. Now on to my review...

In Vegas to celebrate birthdays for a friend and me... wanted to see a show.. couldnt get tix to see Kevin James/Ray Romano show with our friends... saw that Love was playing at the same place (Mirage). Bought tix through the half price ticket stand on the Strip. All I can say is....

WOW! What a spectacular show! This was my first time seeing any Cirque de Soleil show and I was so impressed with the athleticism, grace and talent of every performer. And of course, the music was excellent!

The symbolism behind the visuals brought to new dimensions (or gave me a better understanding of the dimensions that were always there) to the phenomenal music of the Beatles.

The production, performance and artistry was moving, engaging and kept my attention for the entire 90 minute performance. Some of the music includes studio out takes and rare mixes of Beatles songs. My toes were tapping the whole show through.

If youre any sort of Beatles fan, this is one show you cannot miss during your next trip to Vegas."
Beatles Love,"The show was visually stunning! There was so much going on at any moment of the show, it was hard to catch everything, but my eyes loved it.
The colors were brilliant and everything was perfectly coordinated by the actors.
There is definitely not a lot of acrobatics in which you would assume in a Cirque show. Still, it was gorgeous!"
Beatles Love,"Absolutely breathtaking, nothing can compare!!!

Ive seen almost all the Cirque du Soleil shows, in Vegas as well as the traveling ones. They really out did themselves with this one!

Let me start off by saying.....Im not like the majority of people who go to see this show, Im not a HUGE Beatles fan who just cant get enough for them. I mean dont get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of their songs and have immense respect for their longevity. 

I have to disagree with one of the other reviews dont think there is any awkward/bad seats in this place, the way it is set up is amazing and very well done. Like one of the other reviewers, I did seat in a seat right where the sheet ended in the last act and I have to say those probably are the best seats (in the middle area) if there is a best seat in the house. 

As crazy as this may sound, I would defiantly see it again, even with ticket prices around $180"
Beatles Love,"Love is all you need  how about Choreography is all you need!-this is a HUGE waste of $100 (or more).  I never thought someone could make the Beatles boring-but Cirque DID!  Do yourself a favor and use the money for a ticket on buying the Beatles music-you will be VERY HAPPY that you did.  At best this resembles a very good high school dance production of the Beatles.  
This show benefits from enormous and unwarranted hype ONLY because it is the Beatles.  My good memories of Beatles music will be forever tainted by the memory of the $800 I dropped for 6 adults to see this lame piece of crap!!!!!
The people of Cirque suffer from complacency and anyone who reads this review and still buys a ticket---well you are just plain stupid!"
Beatles Love,"Awesome. Pricey tickets, but absolutely worth it. We sat up front, but I dont believe there was a bad seat in the house. Great sound, and great visuals - it stretches your eyes to their peripheral limits. 

Beatles fans wont be disappointed, the song selection was well chosen and orchestrated. The mix meshes well with the performance.

This was by far the best show that we saw in Vegas. Youll catch yourself thinking about it for days afterwards.

The gift shop had some pretty cool overpriced stuff, too. 

There isnt much else to say that others havent already covered, so Ill just say: dont forget to blink."
Beatles Love,"The most visually stunning experience of my life thus far - I am not even a Beatles fan and this took my breath away.  Although Mystere may be a better showcase for the acrobatic stunts/feats of the human body, this show will give you the most interesting 90 minutes you could imagine.

All you need is love, indeed!

PS- dont book the floor seats because a lot of the action is in the air and you will constantly be looking up...if you have a MGM players card, book your seats through that (they often have better seating options than the box office)"
Beatles Love,"This was not my favorite Cirque show... but before you go ragging on me, I still think its amazing work.  The stage, sound, screens, and music were all wonderful.  This isnt the typical Cirque show where you see acrobats fly/jump/swim/etc all around you. This show is not just for Beatles fan but for music lovers all around the world...

Seeing how well this show has done... and the people in the audience, I can only imagine how HUGE the Beatles was.  Pretty amazing music..."
Beatles Love,"I always love CDS til this show. I liked this one the least of all the rest I wacthed (O, Le reve, Ka, etc).  I didnt connect with the songs (maybe the gap generations???)  Anyway, I almost fell asleep when I watched it.  Im overly generous to give 3 stars because of the nice setting and the good choreography. 
Ps,
If this is going to be your first time watching CDS, do not watch this one. Or else, u wont watch other shows.  O is should be on your no. 1 list! :)"
Beatles Love,"Having seen O and Kooza before, I came in having certain expectations for being artistic and for pushing my limits - those death-defying feats usually have my heart racing and my palms sweating.  LOVE totally did not meet my expectations, though in a good way - it exceeded them!  In the words of that great song by Berlin, this performance completely took my breath away.  I hadnt been so moved by a performance like this since I saw The Lion King or Alonzo Kings Lines ballet. 

The performers were just so completely passionate throughout the entire performance, you could just feel those good vibes filling you up.  Not only is it feel good, the music is awesome (LOOOVE the Beatles!), and its visually gorgeous as well - Its really just a whole body experience.  Its great that they have speakers in your seat so you really get the full music experience.  Their use of curtains was also very clever.  

I wouldnt go into this expecting this to be like O or Kooza, this is a completely different playing field here folks.  I really just cannot say enough good things about this except just go see it already!"
Beatles Love,"This was my first show in vegas and I would just like to say that it did not disappoint! I love the Beatles and I feel like the show captured the trippy acid trips that are linked to the time period they must came in. 

A tip I learned from other reviews and am going to emphasize: cheaper seats such as the 300s and late 200s are good because there is one section of the show where a good majority of the seats are covered by a white sheet. Everyone underneath cant see a thing, but there is still a show going on above the sheets. I just feel like if youre goign to be spending 80+ dollars to see a show, youd like to see EVERYTHING.

I loved Love and would definitely see it again."
Beatles Love,I can not sit still for over  an hour and I did not want the show to stop.  Words can not really describe the experience.  Just Go....
Beatles Love,"This was a really great show, and was definitely the highlight to one of my trips to Vegas. 

The only other Cirque du Soleil show I had ever seen was Le Reve at the Wynn. I thought that was kinda boring since it felt so repetitive with guys just jumping in and out of the water. LOVE was a much more diverse show using bungee chords, trampolines, skate ramps, etc. The costumes were a lot more diverse and they also used a lot of video projections. There is so much going on, that it is almost too much to see. But since there is no real central story to follow, you can just look around the stage at whatever is the most interesting thing going on at that moment. 

It really helps to be a Beatles fan. Even if I wasnt that impressed with what was happening on stage, which only happened 2 times during the 26 different music pieces, I still loved hearing the Beatles songs. My gf only knew a handful of songs, and that made her appreciate those parts of the show more, but she still really enjoyed the whole show."
Beatles Love,"Great show!  This definitely exceeded my expectations.  I have not been to any other Cirque du Soleil shows yet, but this was definitely a great start.  It was thoroughly entertaining to watch with fantastic music by The Beatles.  My wife and I will definitely see another Cirque show."
Beatles Love,Ive seen a few cirque du soleil shows but this is by far the best one yet! I absolutely loved it. Ive never been a huge Beatles fan but for this show you dont have to be. The performers were so good and the show is just breath taking. If ever in Las Vegas this show is a definite MUST WATCH!!
Beatles Love,This was my second time seeing this show.  It is amazing and I would come back and see it again.  I catch something new each time.
Beatles Love,My boyfriend surprised me with show tickets on our anniversary trip to vegas and i loved the show! I am not a big fan of the beatles so I was not too excited but once the show started i loved it! The dancing and acrobatics are so beautiful and well done and I truly enjoyed the experience!
Beatles Love,"Out of the 5 Cirque shows Ive seen, this is my favorite. The sound system is amazing to compliment the awesome soundtrack. Its quite possibly one of the most moving experiences from a show Ive ever felt. I would pay full price again to see this show a second time!"
Beatles Love,"We had a blast at the show.  Great music, and great performance.  Very entertaining and colorful costumes and stage presence.  We were lucky enough to get a great deal on the seats and were 5th row back.  Really a feel good show, but to be warned compared to other cirque shows there are less jaw dropping acts.. just go to enjoy the music and be highly entertained. Very entertaining, must see while in Vegas if O is sold out. :)"
Beatles Love,"Cirque du Soleil - Love at the Mirage is a great show for Beatles fans. It is a beautiful theater, well designed show, nice costumes, very fun and has a eighties feel. The show is more of Broadway musical feel to it and is memorable but not exciting.

It is worth seeing and not for everyone. The Mirage is a nice Casino but not a favorite."
Beatles Love,"4.5 Stars.

If you are a fan of the Beatles, then this show is a no brainer. Its a must.

In our group we have a couple who only knew of one or two songs prior to attending LOVE, and not particularly fans of the Four. They enjoyed the show, but not to the same degree as those who has listened to multiple albums (i.e. Me). 

The show is definitely more eye-candy than acrobatics than other Cirque shows. As one girl put it, This is probably the closest Ill get to tripping on acid. During many moments, there is an explosion of action on the stage and in the air. Color lights the walls, splashes all over the floor, performers don every color of the rainbow. The music is exactly what you expect, great songs from the Beatles. 

Much thanks to a previous review, I highly recommend buying tickets on the top balcony on the front row. You get to see the whole picture, especially during That scene. I didnt give this 5 stars is because it doesnt cater to everyone, my girl said she would rather see KA again than LOVE.

Overall, another positive notch on my list of Cirque shows whose batting streak is pretty much flawless for entertainment."
Beatles Love,"I loved this particular show by Cirque du Soleil.  It was entirely different than O and Le Reve.  The music was really fun, and there was so much going on.  My only complaint was that I couldnt take it all in fast enough.

I have recommended this show to a handful of people.  They all loved it.  This show will likely continue in Las Vegas for many years to come, but I would catch it sooner rather than later just to be safe.

As for seats, we sat up close which was great.  Looking around the auditorium, it was hard to imagine that any of the seats were short of spectacular.  Just go!"
Beatles Love,This was the best performance Ive ever seen. It set the bar so high. If you like the Beatles or not you are going to love this show. The only people that dont like this show are miserable people.
Beatles Love,If you like the Beatles... even if you dont.. you will learn to love them. This show is amazing to the tenth degree. The dancers tell the story that the song is trying to portray. it will blow your mind. I promise you. Ive seen a grip of shows on the strip but this takes the cake. I fell asleep in 3 different shows but this one kept my attention and I didnt want it to end. Watch this and you will not be disappointed... or Ill refund your money!!! 6 stars!!!!!!
Beatles Love,"The music was awesome, the show was great, of course I knew it would be. The best thing about my experience was being there with the one I LOVE!"
Beatles Love,"Be forewarned - there are very very few acts or acrobatics that are typical of a cirque show. That being said  - THIS SHOW WAS AMAZING. it was like they animated every Beatles song and brought it to life My boyfriend said I wonder if thats what its like to listen to the Beatles high because it was so whimsical and colorful and just...FUN! I enjoyed it - the only problem you will have is you want to sing a long but you dont want to bother the rest of the people!

We sat in section 203 row N - no bad seats though as the stage is in the round. Awesome! 

No audience participation that is usual of cirque shows."
Beatles Love,"Best show I have seen in a long time!  I live in Vegas and went with my fiancee and future in-laws.  There is no such thing as a bad seat at this show.  If anything, I felt like I couldnt take in everything that was happening on stage because we sat so close (second row)!  Experiential definitely describes this show!  Id recommend it to anyone, Beatles fan or not!"
Beatles Love,"Best show in Vegas. Ive seen many of the shows ranging from Blue Man group to Carrot Top as well as Zumanity and this show is amazing. It doesnt matter where you sit, there is always something amazing going on. And, of course, the soundtrack is awesome. I will definitely go back to see it again."
Beatles Love,"I LOVED THIS SHOW!  I didnt really know what to expect accept my 8 yr old wanted to see it so we did.  It was WAY better than I imagined and Im not a Beatles fan.  I didnt really listen to a ton of their music, so I was nervous to see a show that paid homage to them.  Will Im glad I tried it cause it was great.   Tons of special effects.  A lot of dancing and less typical Cirque stuff, but I loved how each act was an interpretation of the song that was playing at the time.  Costumes and use of color was awesome!  This show will cheer you up on a gloomy day!  Great for kids!  Also,  not a bad seat in the house so you dont have to buy the super expensive seats.  As a matter of fact,  I wouldnt buy the front row seats on this show.  We warned,  sensory overload!  Also,  if youre expecting more acrobatics, then dont come to this show.  If youre looking for a fun and uplifting time with a  new appreciation for Beatles music,  do it."
Beatles Love,"This was the single best entertainment experience of my life.  See this production.  Buy your tickets, try and not think about it or get built up too much, cause I know how that can affect things some times.   If you do all that and you even just like The Beatles you will probably leave the theater in shambles, blown away from an hour and a half of Cirque du Awesomeness!!!    WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Beatles Love,"What an amazing show!  I love the Beatles and have been wanting to see this show since I heard about it.  Luckily, a friend was coming in town so I had an excuse to do the touristy thing and see it.  The visual effects were insane.  I wish I still did drugs cause this show would be a trip!  The skating part was pretty rad and the surround sound on the seats was killer.  My friend was in a wheelchair and they were able to move a chair out and give her her own little surround sound speakers.  Pretty neato.  Id like to see this show again.  There was so much going on that Im sure itd be like seeing a whole other show the 2nd time."
Beatles Love,"I *loathe* Cirque de Soleil, but this show was fantastic.  

Granted, I think setting anything to the Beatles catalog would make it more enjoyable (paying bills, folding clothes, jai alai), but still... it made my tiny little heart swell.  

(The ginormous Beam and Coke I bought in the lobby and that lasted the entire show probably helped, too, but whatever.)

Totally worth the money."
Beatles Love,"What a show!  Great, crisp music and choreographed acrobatics.  Always something going on at multiple levels.  Sat in first row of 306 balcony section- more leg room for tall people and could see whole show without looking up."
Beatles Love,"This is the second time I have seen this show and it got even better than the first one.  Loved it. 

If you expecting a lot of acrobats like the others you may be disappointed.  This show is all about the music and the period it came from.  If you lived through the 60s and 70s you will love it."
Beatles Love,"Great music.  There was a lot of dancing and not much acrobatics.  If you like the music, go see this show.  If you want to see more acrobatics then take in another show."
Beatles Love,"A great show for 2000 people.  A very High Energy show, with way more action than you can take in.  Great Beatles music.  DO NOT TRY AND SNEEK PHOTOS or you will be hounded to delete them.   My only complaint is a desire for a program with a bit of story line and cast member backgrounds and LESS adds for other things in Vegus.  Box Office at the Mirage SUCKED for picking up tickets for the event.  Crowd Mgt was good.  I would try and buy seats in 2nd or 3rd tier and NOT up close to enjoy full show."
Beatles Love,"Went with friends and family to see this a second time, the first being several years before. Not sure I would enjoy the repeat performance, but the acrobatics are always amazing and the choreography and storylines dont fail to impress. And of course you get all the great Beatles music and recordings."
Beatles Love,"Best show Ive seen... amazing stage show, great re-mix of timeless beatles songs... great looking dancers :-)"
Beatles Love,"Wow. I was so impressed. Wasnt expecting much because Cirque has become so commercialized. Ive seen Mystere and Alegria, and thought -- What can you possibly do with the Beatles?

But the integration of music, dance, effects and acrobatics was extremely sophisticated. I especially loved the musical arrangements that incorporated original recordings and soundbites with respectful alterations.

People were singing along (yes, me too) and the audience was MOVED, more than Ive ever witnessed during a live production. I cant help but think that the Beatles resonates with people the way classical music sometimes does. Its truly timeless. And the Cirque production only enhances the qualities that touch us, telling its stories vividly and creatively."
Beatles Love,"not a huge beatles fan but the show was great...
I still think O is the best cirque show"
Beatles Love,"Wow is a good way to start with. I was blown away with this show. Words are hard to put together to show how much i loved it! A Beatles Tribute it is, the music had everyone moving to the beat. It was AWESOME for me and the Wife to see. It was the best show we have ever seen. And the best of Cirque du Soleil, Id have to say."
Beatles Love,"Great show... very entertaining and imaginative.  The only other thing I can add to the reviews already here is that the music in the show focuses on the 60s era of Beatles music.  The show spends maybe 20 minutes max on the Beatles 50s era, and the next 70 minutes is all 60s.  This was a little disappointing for me, since I prefer the Beatles music from the 50s.  But for the shows pomp and spectacular visuals, I can understand why they wanted to focus on the wild and colorful themes from Sgt. Pepper as inspiration.  The acrobatics and stunts throughout the show were all superb.  There were some slow parts in the middle involving strictly dance routines, as I momentarily felt myself awaiting the return of the acrobats.  All in all this was one of the most awe-inducing stage shows that Ive seen and I highly recommend it even to those who are not Beatles fans."
Beatles Love,"This was the last show I saw when visiting Vegas.  I thought it was absolutely fantastic and a must see, especially for Beatles fans.  I got a great deal and got great seats (2nd row!).  That close you can see the performers running by doing their thing it was incredible.  The changing stage was pretty cool and a lot of the aerial stuff was great.  Not overly acrobatic like other Cirque shows but still enjoyable.  I really thought it was cool you can buy drinks at the bar before going into the theater (with your drinks).  Got a margarita with a collector cup for like $15 or so."
Beatles Love,"It was my first time to see a show in Vegas and I enjoyed it. The acrobatics and stage settings were breathtaking, and the musical extracts featured throughout the show harked back to memories of a multitude of Beatles songs. Its played at the Mirage -- centrally located on the Strip. The show was played on a stage with seats surrounding it 360 degree-style, and the curtains draping over in various directions were lifted and put down for amazing artistic effects. I would recommend this show if youre a Beatles fan, or if youre not that into the other more raucous or raunchy shows that are nonetheless a decidedly Vegas staple."
Beatles Love,"One of the best memories in my life time. It was very emotional and moving for the audience and myself. This tribute brings life back into the Beatles. 

This is a must see show for everyone. Seeing the audience in awe by the performance goes to show how much this means to people. I am sure to go back for another performance and bring family and friends."
Beatles Love,"Must love the Beatles music,if not you might not like it.Not like
the other cirque shows alot less stunts much more about the music"
Beatles Love,"I wish I could give this Show more stars!  This show is stunning, loud, colorful, fun, artistic, emotional, and down right beautiful!  We had perfect seats in section O row 209, and I recommend anyone with doubts to go watch this show.  Whether youre a die-hard Beatles fan as I am, or not, youre sure to get a one-of-a-kind show.  I loved LOVE, and Im definitely seeing it again next time I hit Las Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"Ive seen over 5 cirque de soleil shows and this is definitely one of the best.

Ive never been a big Beatles fan, but this show is definitely a must see. It far exceeded my expectations and I plan on watching it again the next time I go to Vegas."
Beatles Love,"I would actually give this 3.5 stars, but I rounded up, because all those bendy Cirque performers deserve it. I think this show is great if you really love the Beatles, but I have to confess that I fell asleep for a minute. This Cirque show has more dancing than some of the others, and there is a bit of a storyline. The performers strength and flexibility never cease to impress me."
Beatles Love,Being a big beatles fan I loved this show. If youre a beatles fan its a must see. Its a family show too. I would definitely see this show again if the opportunity presented itself.
Beatles Love,"I am by no means a diehard Beatles fan (so appreciate my review if you arent a diehard), but I loved loved this show. It was my first Cirque du Soleil show and also my first show in Vegas. The show was full of color, talented artists and I was not bored for even a minute. What a fun evening! The theater is fairly intimidate- I dont think you can get a bad seat in this place! So much fun."
Beatles Love,"WOW!!!!......1 hour and a half of WOW! It is worth EVERY penny whether your a Beatles fan or not. The music, The actors, The special affects, The costumes...just WOW!"
Beatles Love,"Unfortunately, after seeing a FANTASTIC uncomparable show O by Cirque Du Soleil. I was extremely disappointed by LOVE. I didnt feel it had the wow factor and felt it was chaotic with all the colors, costumes and just overall performance. If you are a Beatles fan, I would recommend. Yet, although my Family and I are also fans, I didnt appreciate it. Sorry, just saying."
Beatles Love,MAGICAL! AMAZING! Worth every second. I was upset when I had to blink. Absolutely outstanding.
Beatles Love,"This is the first Cirque Du Soleil act Ive seen in Vegas and wow were my expectations High (not only because Im a Beatles Fan but also because of the hype of my fellow yelpers and overhearing the ooos and ahhs from random people throughout the strip (not to mention the ever so friendly check-in associate at the Mirage praising the show)).

I loved the whole show! Even the chaotic parts had a definite story to tell which was relevant to that particular Beatles song.

We sat in Sec 206 Row M Seat 13-14 and the whole white cloth part of the act was interesting to be a part of~.

I would definitely see it again when I go back to Vegas with my gf. Mirage...great choice on having the show there!

btw favorite song &amp; act: Something"
Beatles Love,"I would describe this as underwhelming.  Considering the absurd price point, I expected a mind blowing experience, but this was not that.  Someone was given a task to create a cirque experience with beatles music, but their heart was not in it.  At best, this was a litelarist interpretation.  Lady madonna mentions boots, so everyone dances with rubber boots.  Lucy in the sky has a spakly woman on a rope.  When a literalist interpretation was impossible (hey jude, etc), they just had random dancing.  The best word here is uninspired.  Go see something less hyped."
Beatles Love,"i would watch this show again in a heartbeat!!

the wifey treated us to this show and it was all that and then some.  we are huge fans of The Beatles so i knew it was not going to dissapoint.

she also got us excellent seats; no obstructions and perfect eye level for the festivities!  we were in section 209.

a huge plus:  using all of the original music.  this made all the difference.  i would have cringed if some cheesy cover band recorded all of the OG songs.  i also liked how they mixed various songs w/ each other, too; very tastefully done.

the stage props were freakin sick, for lack of a better word.  ;)

all of the acrobatics and theatrics are quintessential cirque du soleil but the variety in which they interpreted the songs was creative and entertaining.  a couple of lull moments in the middle but overall an awesome show."
Beatles Love,"This show is very uneven. A few Beatles numbers were staged really well and contributed a new visual poetry to my appreciation of the familiar songs. However too much of the show featured 30 or so performers with various props aimlessly moving about the stage for apparently no reason, as if  only to impress the audience with a large population filling the stage. During these times the show lacked focus and simply rambled along leaving me wondering how this early  70s style experimental theatre related at all to a tribute to the Beatles. Cirque has diluted its original concept by creating too many shows that do not live up to the vision of the original creators. 
Half-price tickets were easily purchased throughout Las Vegas, but even then I felt it was overpriced. There were many empty seats on a week night in mid-January."
Beatles Love,Impressive. Unlike any other Cirque show.! Only problem....you have to see it 3 more times to see everything! WOW! Only one word left.. Love.
Beatles Love,"I dont know if it was the hype, the fact that after a while the cirque style of everything floating everywhere gets a little old to me or even the fact that this was almost TOO Beatleish. Allow me to explain.

First of all it gets 3 stars right off the bat because of course the Beatles Music is amazing so it couldnt be all bad even if the place was dark and all you heard was the music.

But while this show did cover the Beatles history it of course centered on the Sgt. Pepper years- just as Elvis had the 50s Slim Elvis and the 70s bloated Elvis- the Beatles too had their early pop iteration and the later psychodelia/take some acid era. And natuarally it is easier to make the show about the non-linear Psychodelic era as it give unlimited artistiic freedom. And thats the point. There for a while EVERYTHING the Beatles wrote had deeper meanings and everyone had their own interpretation of each and every word the fab 4 wrote. I frankly never cared who the Walrus was even though I own and love most Beatles recordings. And this show too was endless interpretation as to how they presented each song.
And some were cool but some was just like... huh?

Also since the Beatles have such a huge library, and over 90 minutes they did bring a lot of songs, I think the addition of a medley or two that 
covered some of their earlier years (simple ) songs would have been really neat.

Also while the sound was crisp and clear- I think maybe a notch or two louder would have made a little more impact.

Also maybe it was Sunday night when we saw it but the crowd reacted kind of flat. A strained standing O by less than half in attendance was the best they could muster. Maybe a tanked up Saturday night crowd would have appreciated it more?

Not that this was a bad show - it clearly is not. I just think it could have been better"
Beatles Love,Simply one of the best shows I have ever seen. The detail in this show was amazing. I was into the show from beginning to end as was my gf who does not know much about the Beatles. Its truly one of the treasures in Vegas and a guaranteed must see!!!
Beatles Love,Just incredible.  We missed the show last year and had friends tell us it was amazing and not to miss.  We had guests ranging from 26 - 71 and we all loved it.  Breathtaking!!!
Beatles Love,"Very cool! There is not much to say that the other reviewers have not covered--this show is amazing. Acrobatics, skaters on half pipes, people flying around on bungee cords expertly choreographed to the Fab Fours famous tunes. A visual delight that kept my eyes darting and my breath bated."
Beatles Love,"My husband is a huge Beatles fan, and weve seen a bunch of Cirque du Soleil shows, so we were really looking forward to Love. And to be honest, while it was good, there was never that Wow! moment that Ive experienced at other Cirque shows. Love contains great visuals and amazing music, but in reality its a lot of dancing with a bit of acrobatics thrown in. Honestly though, I expected more. I walked out of the other Cirque shows thinking how they hell did they do that? This one I walked out thinking the music was really cool. Unless you love the Beatles, Id recommend O if youre looking for a  more traditional Cirque experience in Vegas (like any Cirque experience can be described traditional!)."
Beatles Love,"Have seen almost every Cirque show there is (traveling and stationary) and I think this might be my favorite   As some have commented, it is NOT the typical CdS show as it doesnt use original music and there is a lot more dance.    But the stage is amazing, the music is amazing (the sound-system is FANTASTIC) and the dancing/gymnastics are incredible.   The way the acts/songs blend together from one into another is masterful.  Ive seen it a couple of times and would see it again.

For people who might want to see it again, I would suggest trying a different location in the theatre - seeing it down low first and then from up high (or vice-versa) will make you love it even more....."
Beatles Love,I knew our trip to Vegas would not be complete if we did not watch a show and since we booked at The Mirage it was but natural to include tickets to Cirque de Soleils The Beatles LOVE. The theaters seating is circular which is not your traditional theater seating so its a bit tricky when you buy tickets online and choose your seats. My husband and I were in the 201 section row N and I believe they were good seats. The performance was great and totally reflected the Beatles songs they chose.
Beatles Love,"WONDERFUL SHOW!!!!!! Just amazing! GO SEE IT!! We needed accessible seating and the nice lady let us in early and we got to pick out seats! Ticket price was great. Sign up for the M rewards card(its free) BEFORE you buy tickets...it will give you huge discount. The show itself was amazing! Perfectly done. If you are in front row a guy comes around with the dry ice smoke in a can and takes it around by the people and puts the smoke on your hair its quite funny. However we have these two old fart grump a**s next to use who were being real jerks to the guy with the dry ice. They have a huge sheet type thing that goes over the people int he audiences pretty cool...unless your claustrophobic. They also take pictures of you and your family before the show and at the end you cam look at them and buy them in the cool frame. If your pictures came out good then buy it, it is great keep sake. Beware a water is like $10 so better to eat before you go to the show."
Beatles Love,We loved it!!  We especially liked the interractive part with the tent coming over the audience.  Very fun and perfect movement with the Beatles music.  I didnt give 5 stars because there wasnt anything that stood out in the show that is different from the others except for the music.
Beatles Love,"Where do they come up with this shit? Not even on my best acid trip could I have envisioned any of this. Alright, I never did acid but if I did, my night at LOVE would describe it perfectly. 1 word WEIRD. Im all for the arts but this show is a trip. We probably wouldve enjoyed the show much more if we had some shrooms. They should have a disclaimer, 2 pills minimum. $170 per ticket. I want a refund."
Beatles Love,worth every penny.   perfectly brilliant. going again soon.
Beatles Love,"Cirque du Soleil prices without the Cirque du Soleil talent.  I kept waiting to be amazed by people doing things with their bodies that I cant do.  Thats why I pay you the big bucks, people!  The costumes and music (of course) are fantastic, though."
Beatles Love,"Im 60 and grew up with the Beatles. Ive seen Paul 7 times, Ringo 2 times, and George once. This show was much better than I expected...and concerning the Beatles...I expect a lot! There are no other words to tell you other than...put this show on your bucket list. It has been going on for 7 years and have 3 more years left on a 10 year contract. It is absolutely...spectacular! If you are a true fan...this show will complete your Beatles collection."
Beatles Love,"Not my favorite Cirque Du Soleil performance.  It didnt have the arobatics and acrobatics and contortion amazing feats that Im used to.  I took my fiance who had never been to a Cirque Du Soleil performance and I was disappointed that this was his first.  Although it had some hints of the aforementioned, I never was like WOW!.  Music was good, but to be honest I found the show a bit boring.  I also had an obstructed view by a partition. I dont know, meh.  :("
Beatles Love,"Simply amazing. Take your lady, you wont go wrong. Even if youre not a fan of the Beatles youll love Love(no pun intended)."
Beatles Love,"This is one awesome show not to be missed! For Beatles fans knowing the story of Julia, it is tough to watch the car wreck scene."
Beatles Love,"I really enjoyed this show BUT I also love the Beatles. I can see if you are not a fan of the Beatles how this show could be kind of boring and/or get on your nerves. The acts themselves are average, again it is all about the music/story line not so much the acrobatics"
Beatles Love,"This was amazing, I highly recommend it when you are in Vegas, it is one of my favourite Cirque shows. I would have given it 5 stars but I was somewhat disturbed by the fact that they had no warnings that people with epilepsy would have problems with some of the acts. I dont suffer from epilepsy but after one particular piece I was worried I might start then and there! The effect was very disorientating and made us all feel a bit queasy. Not a reason to avoid the show unless you have a medical condition, but a warning should be given before you book."
Beatles Love,Another Dont Miss. If you love music youll enjoy this----and the Cirque performers will take your breath away.
Beatles Love,"Totally underwhelming compared to other Cirque shows. Im not sure how to explain my disappointment, just that the music and acoustics were the only highlight for me. Too many people running around the stage that you cant focus on one thing. I will stick to O and Mystere."
Beatles Love,"Great show. Probably the best show Ive seen in Vegas other than O. Youll love it if youre a Beatles fan; youll love it if youre not a Beatles fan. There is a bar next to the auditorium in the Mirage called Revolution Lounge, and they have a pre-show countdown, so you can stay there and youre told when the actual show will begin so you can take your seats."
Beatles Love,"Was it a Cirque du Soleil or a musical?  Was I there to enjoy true Cirque magic as in Mystere or O?  For sure not.  Was I there to enjoy live music as in Mama Mia?  Well, no.  I was VERY disappointed with this show.  It didnt know what it was supposed to be - sure it had some nice lighting effects and the music, well, it was the Beatles, but other than that, this was a real bummer.  Id see Mama Mia, or Celine 10x again and again, or Mystere or O, but this thing, Id hand my ticket to one of the guys on the street handing out porno cards."
Beatles Love,An amazing show.  You walk out of there in a fantastic mood
Beatles Love,"This show was truly amazing and jaw-dropping. Tickets are expensive, but worth every single penny.  I saw O before I saw this, so I had high expectations and LOVE exceeded them!  I went with my 20 year-old brother and we both didnt really love the Beatles that much, but we absolutely loved the show.  Even if you dont care for the Beatles, or are too young to appreciate them, just watching the intricacies of the performance is reason enough to go. 

We sat in the upper section, but it seems that every seat in the venue is a good one. The directors of this are so talented and its crazy to imagine how they thought of all this stuff!! THIS IS A MUST SEE"
Beatles Love,"This was an AMAZING show &amp; I highly recommend it to anyone who goes to Vegas.  Im 32, so I wasnt as into the Beatles, but after seeing the show I cannot seem to stop listening to their albums.  I never realized how many songs I actually knew!  
As for the performance...awesome!  Youll read a lot of comments about how there isnt as much acrobatics or physical feats that is know for the Cirque du Soleil, but thats what I loved about this show.  It focused more on the music than trying to be like, hey, look what I can do!!!  Still, the stunts that were performed were nothing short of amazing. 
This is a MUST SEE show!!!!"
Beatles Love,"Amazing. Costumes, Theatrics, Music, you name it, it was great.  really fun show."
Beatles Love,"AWESOME!  I am not a musical guy but we all know every single song played in this one and it was great.  The combination of familiar music, modern dance, acrobatics, etc... make it an incredible night out.  Really fun.  My wife and I are 40ish and we loved. I bet our kids would have enjoyed too had them been here on this trip. Wholesome family fun! I highly recommend!"
Beatles Love,"By far the best show Ive ever seen.  Let me say this a the start, I dont/didnt/never have liked Beatles music.  

With that said, this show has a way to make you tap your shoe and nod your head to the music.  Also, with most Cirque shows, I have a very hard time paying attention throughout the show, and at some point actually find myself getting a little bored by the time the show ends.  That definitely did not happen with this one. 

With each song having its own story, it definitely helps keep you interested throughout.  Amazing show, and definite must see while youre in Vegas!"
Beatles Love,"There are so many reviews, I really dont need to add anything except I want to see it get an OVERALL rating of 5 stars because it was that good.  It is very heavy on the song and dance and less about crazy stunts up in the air (although they are in the air also!).  It kept me totally entertained...no dozing off in the dark room (that was my KA review).  I loved this show!!! Made me so happy.  I know Beatles music but I wouldnt necessarily call myself a FAN - although you cant help but be after leaving love.  LOVE you, Love!"
Beatles Love,"My girlfriend and I are huge Beatles and Cirque du soleil fans and we were really excited to see this show. We loved beatles music and we love Cirque Du soleil so of course we would enjoy this show right? wrong!

This isnt like other cirque shows (mystere, ka, corteo, kooza), this is more like a dance show to beatles music. There are very little trapeze acts, contortionists, and things that amaze you. Instead people dance and walk around, come down from bungies, and rollerblade. Nothing here is truly amazing.

I was bored when watching this and couldnt wait for it to end. 
after paying $150 for tickets we felt ripped off! We had to see another show to feel satisfied and saw the blue man group the next night (which was awesome by the way). 

If you havent seen a cirque show you will probably like this show, but if youve seen other traditional shows you will probably be bored. It seems Cirque is just lending their name out to new dance shows (viva Elvis, Chris angel believe), so I wont see any of these shows since I heard theyre basically the same. 

If you havent seen a cirque show before I highly recommend Mystere at the treasure island. You will not be disappointed."
Beatles Love,Best show Ive ever seen in my whole life. Period. I loved it and would see it again in a heartbeat. It was worth every penny!! The whole show from start to finish is just so energetic and beautiful. I was so sad when it ended! I love the Beatles but I think that even if youre not a huge fan you can still totally enjoy this Cirque du Soleil show .Ive seen Mystere also and this completely blows that one out of the water. It was just so good!
Beatles Love,"This show was OKAY.  I see that happening a lot now...making money off of dead entertainers like Elvis, MJ, by blastering their music loud and have performers in wild costumes dancing and jumping all over the place.  Lacks originality.  I think the Cirque Du Soleil brand has become too diluted."
Beatles Love,"Best show I ever saw, mind blowing, I recommend it to everyone who goes to Vegas and the peeps that saw it thanked me for hyping it up if you like the Beatles go and see it you will not be disappointed"
Beatles Love,"Such a disappointment.  My wife and I are huge Beatles fans.  We have never seen a cirque show before, so we were thrilled to get the chance.  This did not live up to expectation. There were three stunts that wowed us, but we were expecting a show of that.  It was much more of a dance performance than a circus performance, and one without a coherent message or story at that."
Beatles Love,"This was a totally FUN performance! The only other Cirque du Soleil show I have been to was O, which I really enjoyed. But, Love was very good as well, but very different. Love was a very fun performance with the typical, incredible acrobatics you know you will get from Cirque. The stage and props were amazing, the seats even had speakers in the back of each one to completely emerge you, and the set and seats were in a circle so theres no bad seat in the house. I would recommend sitting slightly higher to get a better view of everything. An awesome performance!"
Beatles Love,"3 stars just for the music and the few times that it lived up to CduS standards. I thought it was very imaginative, but definitely not what I expected. If I had known there was going to be mostly dancing, then I would have seen O again. That, IMHO, is the best CduS show on the strip! I like the Beatles, not love them, so I guess this show wasnt for me."
Beatles Love,"This is, hands down, the coolest thing I have EVER seen.   I have always enjoyed the Beatles music but after seeing this I became an even bigger fan.  The music, the choreography, the lighting, the stories that the music was able to tell in its new form just blew me away.  I see, feel, hear and taste the mastery of their music in a whole new way.  You dont need to be familiar with the music or have to the most expensive seats in the house to enjoy the show.   There is just so much going on and from all directions that you wont be and you wont miss a thing.  The whole production is just mind blowing."
Beatles Love,"LOVE is all you need.  Seriously.  This was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed every moment.  The music was fantastic and I particularly loved hearing clips from The Beatles messing around in the studio when they were young.  The dancing and acrobatics were entertaining, although one of the stunts made me uncomfortably nervous.  I have heard from most that there are fewer acrobatics that the other Cirque shows, but dont let that keep you away.  If you are at all a Beatles fan, this show is fun and entertaining.  There are moments where the dancing is a little boring, but all in all, two thumbs up.  The skaters, the music, the costumes and the cirque people were all fantastic.  I would see it again!"
Beatles Love,Did you ever close your eyes and see things when you used to listen to the Beatles? Cirque du Soleil takes those closed-eye visualizations and puts them on stage.
Beatles Love,I was entertained for all 90 minutes. Would recommend seeing this show to anyone. Good music and amazing performers.
Beatles Love,Cirque du Soleit has always been my favorite... now with the addition of Beatles music. Nothing else can go wrong with this combination. 2 thumps up!
Beatles Love,"This was by far the worst Cique du Solell show ive ever seen. Every single person Ive spoken to who have liked it have said the same thing i loved the music. If you come out of a Cique du Solell talking about the music I think something is really wrong with the show. Also for the price of the ticket you could easily buy some beatles albums and enjoy it on your own sound system.  There were hardly any acrobatic stunts and it was mainly people dancing around. On the upside the sound was really good, there were speakers on the front of the seat, on the headrest and below the seat. If this show wasnt compd I would have been really pissed."
Beatles Love,"Very fun show with a lot to see.  Felt very psychedelic but that is quintessential Beatles.  Most of the Beatles more famous songs are in the show.  Also, the dancing, choreography, sets, acrobatic stunts, and video combined with the music, is for a Beatle fan or anyone who likes a great show"
Beatles Love,"This was literally the best live performance Ive ever seen. Im not a huge Beatles fan, but I really enjoyed myself. The show was a visual and musical delight. I heard this was one of the best Cirque shows, but the amount of creativity and coordination that must have went into LOVE is beyond what I expected."
Beatles Love,"I have to admit that I wasnt a huge Beatles fan before seeing this show, but I enjoyed every second of it and the performance gave me a new found appreciation for their music."
Beatles Love,"Overall this show was too strange and expensive for me to fully enjoy.  As other people have mentioned, it is much more about dance than the acrobatics of other Cirque shows, although Love also relies more heavily on theatrical effects.  Its a very trippy show and I think at some point the creators mixed up abstract artistry with throwing a bunch of random-ass shit together.  For example, some burning questions:
- why was the KKK at the carnival scene?
- why were the Beatles in space?

The music was obviously good but didnt use as many of the upbeat Beatles songs as I would have expected and if youre only going because you love the music, save yourself at least $100 and buy a Beatles CD.  If you dont mind completely incoherent things happening on stage while Beatles music is playing, then go for it - its very neat - but dont expect anything to make any shred of sense.  That was my mistake.

A few pieces of advice if purchasing tix though:
- Be sure to check BroadwayBox.com beforehand to see if there are any discounts available - most tickets are priced $150 and $125 normally.
- I suggest NOT sitting in the very first section (100 series) as there are quite a few effects from the ceiling.  The theater presents pretty good views from all seats
- If you need to pick up tickets from the Mirage box office, go EARLY instead of right before your show - the line for pickup can be REALLY long an hour before a show starts
- You get a 2-for-1 ticket for the REVOLution lounge at the Mirage from 8-10pm with each ticket purchased.  Offer applies only to well drinks, beer, and wine."
Beatles Love,"Ive never been to any other cirque productions but being a big fan of the Beatles, the show was highly entertaining and worth every penny (I sat almost at the front row with the hubby). The music was excellent, the stunts were awesome and I really loved the drinks they serve too."
Beatles Love,Loved LOVE!  I have seen all the Vegas Cirque shows ( O twice) and thought i was burned out by the Cirque concept. This show was pure eye candy and both me and my spousal unit were enchanted with the visuals and music. (though my spousal unit was not a Beatles fan) My favorite part was the appearances by the lady in red who was obviously a fantasy based on John Lennons mother Julia. The imagery based on  her accidental death was absolutely stunning and poignant. Make sure you sit up high in the theater. This is a show that you want to sit above to appreciate the spectacular production. I think both O and Love are best appreciated for the grandness by sitting up and back in the theater. This will be one of my go to shows when we have friends in town. Love Love!
Beatles Love,Amazing show!! It doesnt matter if you are a fan of the beatles or not...it keeps your attention the whole time. A must see show for sure!
Beatles Love,"Im a HUGE fan of Cirque du Soleil, and Ive seen quite a few of their shows, so I feel qualified to compare LOVE vs what Im going to call the Typical  Cirque show. - 

While the other shows Ive seen (Ka, O, and a few 1980s ones) were solid 5 Star shows, LOVE is really a 3 star. - 

I was super disappointed in the lack of acrobatics; almost nonexistent. 

Very Non -Cirque like.
However, the music was absolutely fabulous ...any Beatle fan will be in heaven, thus the overall 4 Star rating. 
They tried to have a story line, which was totally unnecessary; but thats neither here nor there. - 

Go for the costumes. Go for the Music. 
If youre looking for vintage Cirque, where the cast is flying high, and audience is Oooing and Aaahing, then go see a different show."
Beatles Love,The performance was OUTSTANDING! Every Seat in the theater a Great one.  We were in last row and could see everything as well as those up close and personal. Do Not Miss It! AMAZING!
Beatles Love,"This was my first Vegas show, and I LOVED IT!!!!!  This show was absolutely amazing! The acrobats and dancing and showmanship/entertainment was great!  I thought it was kind of funny that they had photographers walking around the audience taking photos of you there so you could purchase after the show.  Anyway, Im not a huge Beatles music fan, meaning that I like their music, but Im not fall down in love with it, but again, I LOVED IT! If your a Beatles music hater, then you might want to skip it, because of the people I know, the ones who really dislike Beatles music and only went because their significant other wanted to see it are the ones who hated it."
Beatles Love,"Awesome show. The theatre is great, no real bad seat in the house. The sound was amazing as well, since there are speakers in the headrest and on the back of the seat in front of you. Each song was pretty amazing. Highly recommend this show to everyone, whether youre a huge Beatles fan or not."
Beatles Love,"As a fellow audience member said after the show, finally I got my moneys worth in Vegas. Loved this show, when I wasnt smiling my jaw was dropped in awe. Amazing, would go back in a second."
Beatles Love,"It wasnt what I expected. Plus Im not a huge Beatles fan, I like some of their songs, but I dont know em thoroughly. It seemed like a more grand broadway musical. The dancing was great, but there was so much going on on the stage at once, it was hard to see everything. Plus our seats were right next to the stage, so that didnt help. The show just didnt have that Cirque wow factor for me."
Beatles Love,A Vegas MUST SEE. Love this show!!! So beautiful! Seen it twice. Use a online discount code or hit up the Coke bottle special tickets.
Beatles Love,"Well worth the $$$$!!  They are having a special of buy one ticket - get the 2ed for $25.00!  (I dont know when this special ends.)   Of course, the music was AMAZING!!  Like all Cirque show it was imaginative and soooo creative!!  Go see Love!  Take some one special and hold hands while you sing the songs!!   Long Live the Beatles!"
Beatles Love,"My eyes did not know where to look throughout most of the show- overstimulation.  The performers were incredibly talented and the props/set was great.  Also a plus that the music is familiar so that keeps the audience engaged.  It follows somewhat of a plotline, but seems to be more of a artistic expression (hence the circus part), so if you are looking for a story to follow you are looking in the wrong place.  This is a great show for someone who enjoys the arts.  My husband unfortunately fell asleep during My Guitar Gently Weeps, but maybe the late Vegas nights didnt help."
Beatles Love,"Love, love, love, love this show! I wish it was longer!! I will definitely be back to see it again! Of all the Cirque du Soleil, this is my favorite. And, if youre a beatles fan or like the beatles, you MUST see this. I went with my cousin who doesnt know beatles songs.. I know, right?.. but she was still quite entertained. TIP: get a higher seat (its cheaper and you see everything) At one point of the show, the audiences at the bottom were covered...  I highly recommend this show! I wish I went in earlier instead of on time so i couldve taken pictures of the lobby area and redeemed by buy one get one free drink coupon thing that they handed out with the ticket."
Beatles Love,"Just amazing. I have seen it twice and would definitely go back for more. The mixing of the songs together and original Beatles talk sessions is great. It is not as acrobatic and full of crazy tricks like other Cirque shows so be aware before buying tickets (as seen from disappointed reviews below!) This is by far the best show on the strip in my opinion.. both times I have been, I saw the show from a different angle and it is completely different as there is so much happening on the stage. Highly recommended to a true Beatles fan, both young and old."
Beatles Love,"Beyond my expectations of a Vegas show! Amazing, overwhelming display of creativity, choreography, artistry, sound and visuals. Everything. Every seat had speakers built in. Even our quasi-nosebleed seats were well worth it. Extremely helpful pages to show you around and easy to find the seats. I only recommend you buy your tickets online in advance and plan your trip around it."
Beatles Love,"Pretty expensive and not terribly original.  I didnt really see a clear theme, other than obviously Beatles music.  As usual talented performers.  But in my opinion not worth the ticket price.  If you really want to go then try half price ticket provider.  I would vote for the Absinthe show if you are up for raunchy."
Beatles Love,"Amazing! I saw this and O in the same week, and should not compare them, but I did prefer this. The music (and sound system) was incredible as were the physical performances, costumes and set. Worth the money! Go."
Beatles Love,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show is. I have no idea how these performers can move like they do. The props, scenery and costumes are like candy to the eye. Each one out does the next. Of course the music is great - The Beatles - do I say more. This is by far the best Cirque du Soleil show."
Beatles Love,"Ive only watched other Cirque du Soleil shows on tv, but from what I can tell, Love seems a little different, but is still equally entertaining.  What a fantastic show!  I am a huge Beatles fan and I had such a good time.  The soundtrack was so good - they included psychadelic tracks (my fave, Tomorrow Never Knows), which is what I hoped for.

For those of you who arent hardcore fans, I think you will still enjoy the show because its also a fun visual experience.  The costumes and props are absolutely beautiful and tie into the performances.  There are several types of dance featured, but my favorite were the aerial acrobatics.

The venue is designed well because there isnt a bad seat in the house.  The stage is in the center of the audience, which is seated stadium-style and no matter where you sit, you will either get a good view of stuff happening on the stage or stuff happening in the air.  There are large screens that add visual effects, there are speakers in the headrests of the seats.

Going into the performance, I had pretty high expectations and I feel that they were met.  As soon as the show was over, I wanted to watch it again.. and again.. and again!  When I go back to Vegas, Im definitely watching this again."
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque show, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. As a disclaimer, Im not a huge Beatles fanatic or anything, which may have contributed to the disappointment.  We got tickets to Love because it was discounted, whereas other Cirque shows were not. 

Ive heard this show is not like most of the other Cirque shows. Definitely less acrobatics and awe factor, and more about the dancing, artistry, and music.  Sometimes there was so much going on in the stage, my brain was overwhelmed with what to watch.  

You know the shows a winner when you fall asleep during it. Which is what happened to me.

If youre not a huge beatles fan, Id think twice before going."
Beatles Love,"What an awesome way to celebrate the Beatles music! This show was one big party! The 60s and Beatles lyrics inspired costumes were great, and I felt like the performers were having a fun time when they were dancing around. This show is definitely not typical acrobatics Cirque, but it was so enjoyable. In-line skating?? Only Cirque..."
Beatles Love,"This is by far my favorite show in Vegas. If you are a Beatles fan it is not to be missed. Its inventive and you will be blown away by the acrobatic feats performed on the stage. The music is of course amazing. I urge everyone to check this show out, you will not be disappointed. I also recommend splurging on the best seats you can, we sat about six rows back from the stage and it was incredible, completely worth it."
Beatles Love,I have seen several Cirque shows and this one was not up to par.   I think it may be more appealing to Beatles fans.  The acrobatics were very good but there were not enough.  I fell asleep at one point.   The others in my group thought it was okay.  I just think it can be hard to relate to if you arent a Beatles fan.
Beatles Love,"What I love about this show?
* The music - this brought of many fond memories so many years back.
* The stage - interesting concept.
* We were seated at the top level. I liked this better as we got to see everything that was happening on the stage.
* Audio-Visual effects - images posted on those sheer screens while the music and the acts were going on.

Dislike?
* Again, we were seated at the top level and still paid more than $120 EACH for the tickets
* The acts were mostly acrobats hanging from the rafters with their elastic bands, etc. Theres not much variety here..

My friend and I both think that O was better.. If you have not seen one Cirque show, this is the one to see!!"
Beatles Love,"Spectacular!  This was my first Cirque show and I didnt have any expectations.  This was purely a visceral experience from the visuals to the sound.  We sat pretty high up and far from the stage, but our view was unobstructed.  I only wished it was longer."
Beatles Love,"I cannot even put into words how much I loved the entire show. Ive never had the opportunity to hear the Beatles music through such an incredible sound system  and at that volume. The perrformance in addition to that just made it spectacular. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, so excited to find out what the next song would be and how the performers would depict it. The compilation of songs was just perfect. Our seats were as far back as they could possibly be, but that just made it easier to see everything that was going on. There really isnt a bad seat in the house. Since I will never be able to go to a Beatles concert, this was definitely the next best thing! If you are a fan, you MUST see this fantastic show. I plan to see it at least 5 more times :)"
Beatles Love,"You MUST MUST MUST watch this show. You will have a great time! It is not as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows, its more choreography and theatrics. You will smile during and after the show."
Beatles Love,"Great show! Great acoustics also, making these Beatles favorites sound that much better (especially George Harrisons vocal on Something). Would definitely want to see it again when in Las Vegas."
Beatles Love,You do not I repeat do not have to be a Beatles fan in order to love this show. It wasnt over the top and it ended in the perfect amount of time leaving you wanting more (just like they taught the bands back in the day). The acoustics were fantastic and keep your ticket so you can get a buy one get one free drink at the Beatles lounge that doesnt play Beatles music. The lounge was badddd. My personal tip get a seat in section 200 or above because the best stunt in the show you will not be able to see if your sitting close.
Beatles Love,"I am going to be the maverick and give this show three stars. I love the Beatles but the show, in my opinion, did not represent them or their music the best possible way. It is mostly dance and artistic renditions of the fab four. Not enough acrobatics. Some people may like that but if I am watching a Cirque de Soleil production, I want death defying, precision, skilled and inventive moves."
Beatles Love,"Im not a Beatles fan but I have heard some of their songs from time to time.  The show was decent, but I thought the other Cirque shows were better.  O was good because of awesome stage and water, similar to Le Reve.  Mystere was good because of the acrobats.  Love didnt have any of that.  At no point during the show was I really wowwed by anything.  I decided to get tickets to this show because of all the raving reviews and I forced myself to go even though Im not a fan of Beatles songs.  I shouldve seen Ka instead."
Beatles Love,"The show started in spectacular fashion, but after literally 3 minutes a voice announced that there would be a temporary suspension. After half an hour they announced it was cancelled for technical reasons. Yet they said there would be a later show, no problem. As it was the main reason we had come to Las Vegas and as this was our last night, we ended up spending a lot of money for very little result. They handled the cancellation very efficiently, which mad me wonder HOW OFTEN THIS HAPPENS. Beware - you may be disappointed, and it makes me wonder if this happens with other Cirque du Soleil shows."
Beatles Love,Great show!!! All seats are good seats.  If you stay at the Mirage you might be able to get a deal on your tickets.  We got ours for $95 vs. the regular $175!
Beatles Love,"I always thought Zumanity would be one of my fave Cirque shows but Love blows it all away.  Love just makes me want to join the Cirque de Soleil circus act. After watching that show, I made sure I would not leave Vegas without purchasing the soundtrack and the show book.  the music and the whole story was awesome. Definately go watch the show this season since you can find tickets for as low as 30% off."
Beatles Love,"I saw this show with a friend for her birthday and it is my absolute favorite of all the Cirque shows here in Vegas.  Felt like an eye-gasm! ... If you love The Beatles, it is a must. We had great seats, not up by the stage but not in the very back. There is so much going on all over. They cover alot of their songs, my favorite being Blackbird. I also loved the performance of Octopuss Garden. I want to go back and watch it again! 

Also, check out the Revolution lounge before or after the show, We went and got a drink before the show started."
Beatles Love,"What a visual feast. This was my first Cirque experience and I am look forward to the others, soon I hope. So much to see and beautifully presented. It was music for the eyes, Beatles music no less. We sat about five rows from the front  . . .WOW!"
Beatles Love,"LOVE broke my cirque virginity, and for that reason alone it will always have a place in my heart. however, I gotta sans 1 star due to too much interpretive dance. no bueno for this here young lady. more death defying stunts please."
Beatles Love,"AMAZING! The raw talent, agility and sheer body strength that every performer not only has individually but as a troupe in this show will honestly blow your mind.  We were escorted to other seats as upgrades for whatever reason...who cares...didnt ask.  (had balcony and wound up in 2nd row.)  Frankly, I dont think it mattered what seat we sat in...this was an incredible show.  You will hear all the songs you crave from a Beatles show and your senses will be lifted in all ways.  Get there early if you want drinks as the line at the bars r craaazy long.  Bonus of the show  while all of this is treating your eyes, ears &amp; nose ( I wont spoil it...but damn I want to tell u so badly:)...there is a constant shadowy video in the background with the progression of the Beatles (actual audio)  fame and the times they encountered during the ride.  I go to Vegas often and I am ashamed to say I do not pull myself away from the bj tables, bars &amp; restaurants enough to see shows when I visit.  This changed my mind.  I will make it a point to see at least one show each trip from now on.  See this show!  You will walk out feelin the love..."
Beatles Love,"Great, great, great show. I went reluctantly because the Beatles were such a great band and I did not want to see their music mis-used. This show was way beyond my expectations."
Beatles Love,"Little darling the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun
and I say its alright...at CIRQUE DU SOLEIL LOVE! - Beatles (here comes the sun)

Here comes the sun du du du...dang the song is still stuck in my head...which means the show did its job! I think this is one of the longer running Cirque shows on the strip and i can see why. They continually attract a huge audience and after watching it, i wouldnt be surprised if people kept coming back again and again. I wouldnt say im anywhere close to being the biggest Beatles fan as i only have their greatest hits cd, but most of the songs they play here are recognizable and fun. Theres an interesting mix of acrobatics and performance dance as well as jumps, skates, and creative use of props. Without giving away too much, this 90 min show with no intermission appeals to the masses. I also got extremely good seats late in the afternoon of the day of the performance so feel free to drop in anytime. I sat in the pit and you could see everything up close, but looking at the size of the theatre and the setup of the stage, i dont think theres a bad seat in the house :)"
Beatles Love,"The best part of my weekend was watching this show.  I felt like I was actually there in the room with John, Paul, George and Ringo.  To think of their legacy is mind-blowing.  Suddenly as I watched and listened, I thought to myself, Man..how many songs did they write and perform together?  (More than 200, I was told)  I know that Ill never think of Something in the same way after watching the performance on Saturday.  It was absolutely one of the best shows Ive ever seen in my life.  Worth every penny, even though I didnt shell out a dime.  *wink*"
Beatles Love,"had an amazing experience! totally epic! took my dad for his birthday, he and i are fans of The Beatles! Fantastic opening of the show.. got teary eyed with the music selection... non stop action! This is a MUST to catch when you are in Vegas! totally seeing it on my next visit!"
Beatles Love,"All you need is LOVE!  Ive been waiting to see this show since it came out.  Its always been too expensive so when we saw a deal online, we jumped on it!  The show was amazing!  They sell big drinks for $15.  I kept the cup!  I love the music...I love the beatles!"
Beatles Love,"Went to see love recently. Wow what a treat. At first there is so much going on that you get sensory overload. But after you adjust its just sit back and enjoy the show. The sets are amazing, the costumes are awesome and the music is incredible especially if you are a Beatles fan. It is very different than most Cirque shows as the focus is on the music of the Fab Four and not so much on acrobatics or contortionist, but it is special none the less."
Beatles Love,"We were there for the 7:30 Dec. 30 showing  and the show itself was awesome.  But through no fault of the performers; there was an hour long interruption caused by technical or mechanical difficulties at the beginning of the show.   For some reason the center staged got jammed and would not go down.  The bummer part was the general manager of the show came out after a few minutes and made an announcement saying the technicians should be finished fixing the problem in about 5 to 8 minutes...........which actually took an hour.  He should have offered free drinks or something for the inconvenience....since we missed our dinner reservation!    But overall, the show was spectacular....yes, this is one of the best cirque du Soleil show I have seen!"
Beatles Love,"What a spectacular show!! I was highly impressed, and so was my hubby! Our seats were in the nose bleed section on the balcony level. I purchased the tix at a discount from Cirque Du Soleil for $90 per person. In all honesty, I dont think there is even a bad seat in the whole building! The effects of the show just kept us in awe every moment and rocking out to the good old Beatles songs, it was awesome! This is my 7th Cirque show, and it is probably one of my top 3!"
Beatles Love,"Amazing!!!  I would see it again tonight.  The music, of course, wonderful.  The visual effects as well as the stage changes, lighting was amazing.  The costumes were beautiful.  Not as much cirque acts as I am used to but it was beautiful.  Great for young adults and old.  We had seats literally in the way back, but still was amazing.  For $60 bucks or so you cannot go wrong."
Beatles Love,"If you like the Beatles and enjoy Cirque du Soleil performances, then The Beatles LOVE is one of the best shows you will see in Las Vegas."
Beatles Love,"Amazing! This was my first Cirque show, and if the others are anything like this one, Id love to see more. Im a HUGE Beatles fan, so I, of course, had to see this one first. The music was great, duh, but I was also blown away by the sheer athleticism of the performers. They are all simply incredible. I also loved the art direction of the show; the sets, the scrims (I especially loved the images projected on them), the costumes, etc. The interpretation of the songs and the lives of the Beatles was so interesting and Im very excited to watch All Together Now, the documentary based on the creation of this show all the more. If youre a Beatles fan, this show is a must see."
Beatles Love,I am a huge Beatles fan. This show is a must see for any Beatles enthusiast like myself. I have seen plenty of Cirque shows and this is one of my favorites because the music is so wonderful with the stories that they put on for each song. The only downfall is that on some of the acts/songs (aka the lsd phase) there was so much going on all over the place that it was hard to keep focused. I feel like I missed so much and that I need to see it again in order to see everything.
Beatles Love,"I was never a Beatles fan. This show made me LOVE the Beatles music! It was the best show I have ever seen. The non stop action and poignant theatre props used with the music made me fall in love with the music I have heard for years growing up, but it was never so exciting as what captivated me. Amazing is an understatement. This is a must see show. The only dilemma is that this is the best and nothing will compare!"
Beatles Love,"I love shows and this one is one of the best I have seen in Vegas. High class experience from the line to get in, to the show, to the time you leave and go to the buffet down the hall. A great overall Las Vegas show experience. A lot of music and things to see. A great show for the eyes and ears. Comfortable seats and good service at my table."
Beatles Love,I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this show. Considering Im not a very big beatles fan. Although I do love a few of their songs. It helps when watching the show. Took my younger brother here for his 21 b day. He loved this show. So thats all that really mattered to me. Visually this show is very much mind blowing. And to be quite honest there really isnt a bad seat in the house. I sat at top balcony. Was really able to see the whole set. Its pretty cool how every seat has their own set of speakers. So you can really get into it. Kinda bummed there wasnt very many acrobatics. But the visual stuff made up for it. I hate to be negative. But there were some real pointless acts in the show. Like this rain boot set they had. So annoying. There was another less than entertaining portion. Just cant really remember. All in all it was pretty good. We also got our tickets at discount price so I cant complain. Id recommend this show for a younger audience. Dont get me wrong its great for adults too. But Im sure everyone has different tastes. I think if I was a bigger fan of the music. I would have gave it more stars. But its worth checking out.
Beatles Love,I grew up listening to the Beatles because my parents would always play their records so when I saw that they were having a Cirque du Soleil Show... I really wanted to see it... I am so glad I did!  The show was phenomenal... It made me smile throughout the show... Everything about it was great!  The whole Love stadium was set up so nicely and even the parts leading up to it... even their special cocktails which were really strong!
Beatles Love,"One of the best deals in Las Vegas - go to the Mirage web site and pick up 25% off your tickets on certain nights - and there are a lot of dates to select from.
The bar provides some nice quality drinks ( at a reasonable price - $12 and $13 ) and they only help to enhance your experience.
I got an excellent seat ( I think) near the stage and one of the runways used by the performers to enter and exit the stage. 
Thinking about this whole show - it was like watching the Beatle movies coming to life right in front of you. 
Being a big fan of beatles music, it was enjoyable to see the interpretations of the music played out in front of you.
The high wire rope work throughout the show was amazing and the coordination between the four roller blade specialists was the highlight of the show. 
This performance is much different from Mystere, Ka or O. 
If you enjoy acrobatic acts you will enjoy the performance at O or Mystere. Ka is amazing theater production - 
but if you enjoy interpretive dance, you will really enjoy this program.
I would rank this show 4th. behind O, Ka, and  Mystere. 
That being said - all the Cirque du Soleil shows are such high quality productions, with so much going on all different parts of the stage, you will see something different each time you come back and view the show.
 I must admit, I really enjoyed this show knowing  I watched it for much less than most of the people siting in my section.
Beatles LOVE
A relaxing, enjoyable show. 
Thats all I know.........."
Beatles Love,"Whether your a hard core Beatles fan, an admirer (like archi), or are indifferent to their music (like me)....This show is magical! It was action packed from beginning to end. Highly recommend this show. Its a true production and art form. Compared to Zumanity there is less acrobatic stunts"
Beatles Love,"Completely blown away.  I was dragging my feet about seeing a Cirque de Soleil show because I had seen them on Bravo and felt like I had the general idea and didnt need to drop a bunch of cash to see it in person.  I am sooo glad I went.  In fact I would like to go back and listen to the music again with the lyrics and then see it again to pick up on what I missed.  There was so much going on related to the lyrics that went right over my head because I didnt know all of them.  I think this would appeal to anyone - I really cant even imagine why it wouldnt.  If youre debating about going to see this show, dont - go.  You wont regret it."
Beatles Love,Great Show...By far the best Cirque show to date
Beatles Love,"Just watched Beatles Love yesterday and it was awesome. Ive seen Ka &amp; Mystere and Love is better than both of those. It is non-stop action and theres not really a bad seat in the house from what I can tell. This show is great even if you are not much of a Beatles fan at all. As usual, it is a Cirque show so the acrobatics are amazing.

Tip 1 - get there 30 min early so you can get a drink at the bar, otherwise the line is too long and you wont make the show. They close the doors and wont let you to your seat even.

Tip 2 - take some pictures early before the crowds arrive. After the show is over it is a mob scene."
Beatles Love,"Absolutely amazing, Beatle fan or not. Nuff said, just GO. (They have gigantic super-sized frozen margaritas at the concession stand!)"
Beatles Love,"LOVE was a great experience for those Beatles fans (myself included). The show featured all of Beatles hits. The stage and they way they featured the Beatles was phenomenon... as if youre really at one of their concerts. Only thing that lacked was the crazy acrobatic acts I look forward to in any Cirque du Solei shows, but being a huge Beatles fan, I definitely appreciated the show sans the jumping, flipping, etc. (I mightve missed some of that due to their creeper cocktails from the concession stands...)"
Beatles Love,"Great show, the visuals match the music perfectly. Espically in the song Octopuss Garden, it really looks like an underwater scene. The music is fantastic as well, the modifications of the Beatles songs sound great, and the sound system is fantastic. My fiancee is not much of a Beatles fan but she enjoyed the show and the soundtrack."
Beatles Love,This was my first cirque de soleil show. This was my 6th time to vegas without seeing this show which i have been dying to see. It was amazing!!! I was on the edge of my seat everytime. I mean what possibly could be better than all these stunts to the beatles. I mean cmon what could possibly be better than that??? GO SEE IT!!!!
Beatles Love,"Such a fun, uplifting show!!! I smiled the entire night and Im not even a Beatles fan!! All I could think about was how much I wish I could afford to give tickets to my friends and family to see this. I felt it was a privelage to be there to see this show...worth every penny of the ticket price!!"
Beatles Love,"It seems like Im preaching to the choir, but I loved Love.  My bf and I sat in seats Sec 209, Row R, Seats 23-24.  The view was great, I didnt feel like I was missing out.  Also, I agree that I felt like there was a lot of things going on up higher, and I particularly felt grateful for sitting up high when they busted out the parachute, which was an awesome effect.  I absolutely cant wait to check out the rest of the Cirque du Soleil shows!"
Beatles Love,"I usually purchase the whole VIP package for Cirques.  However, on this occasion, I had to suffice with nosebleeds, as my company was on a budget.  ...And, surprising to say, it wasnt that bad.  We had the first row, toward center aisle in the $90 section.  I dont know how the other seats are, but these had speakers in them.  Furthermore, I was delighted to see that there were plenty of air in the show.  By that, I mean, most of the things where in flight and for nosebleed, that equaled eye level.  (yay!)  I didnt have to gain a kink in my neck to see the show.  I just sat back and enjoyed.  Overall, it was a lovely piece.  It barely falls in my top ten favorite Cirques, but it was nice. Its more along the lines of Delirium, if youre a fan. -- stars based on category, not food"
Beatles Love,Loved LOVE~!  what a fun great experience....if you love the beatles music you will love this.  It was my first Cirque Du Soleil show and i was beyond impressed!
Beatles Love,"My hubby took me to watch LOVE for my birthday and I love it!  The show was amazing and I enjoyed every moment of it.  The music, the dancing, the acrobats were  all fantastic!  It seems like wherever you will sit, you will have a good view.  If you like the Beatles even just a little bit, then its a show you must go see.  It is such a fun, entertaining show that I would definitely watch it again!"
Beatles Love,"After reading all the great reviews for this show, I was really excited to see what this was all about. I thought the performers did a great job in expressing the music, but I didnt understand the plot or if there was a plot? The costumes, props, and performers were definitely amazing though! I fell in love again with a lot of songs I havent heard in awhile. We sat in section 205, which is a corner section, for $100."
Beatles Love,"Excellent. It really celebrates the Beatles music. The music is stunning, I attended the preview show and the Q and A session after the show. One of the Cirque people detailed the sound system. Its amazing! The visuals are great too. I went a couple more times. :) The theatre is small so you dont need your binoculars! If  your worried about affordability make sure to monitor the specials online."
Beatles Love,"I loved the music, the arrangement, the set up, but I felt like something was a little lacking. It was my first Cirque show, so I dont have a lot to compare it with, but there seemed to be a disconnect between the music and the performance. That said, Im glad I saw it, Id recommend it to others (based on the music alone), but Im not so sure Id want to see it again."
Beatles Love,"I loved this show so much I wanted to watch it again right after it finished. Its not the typical Cirque show, but a perfect tribute to the Beatles...Cirque does the fab four proud! If your looking for the typical Cirque show I would not recommend this one (try O), but I love the Beatles so maybe Im biased. I did not love the giftshop and their $40 t-shirts tho..."
Beatles Love,"Ive seen this show twice now and I loved it both times. If you havent seen it, its well worth it. Any seat is good but the experience will be different in different spots."
Beatles Love,"So it seems to me that some of the reviews rave about the music and only give so/so ratings on the performance. As a huge Beatles fan and the great reviews on this site, I expected this show to be amazing. Instead, I got great music with a bunch of hippies doing an interpretive dance. I have never seen a Cirque show, but this is not what I expected. The few acrobatic acts that were performed were great, but for the rest of the time I felt like I needed to be on drugs to watch it. 

Sure, the music is great and the way they remixed it is awesome. But, I recommend buying the soundtrack if you are going because you love their music so much. 

We had seats that were pretty high up, but I dont think I would have wanted to be any closer to the ridiculous spectacle performed below. 

All in all, the ticket price is not worth a few good acts with an hour of arm flailing. 

My suggestion is spend your money on the soundtrack and skip the show. Im only giving it three stars because of the music and the really cool Help scene."
Beatles Love,Absolutely amazing!  I was totally blown away by this production.  Definitely worth seeing even if it doesnt have all the usual Cirque stuff.  I cant wait to go back again.  Its the kind of show that you could see 10 times and probably still find new surprising things happening on the stage.  Whoever created this show is a genius.
Beatles Love,"It is a fun show to watch. The stage is amazing and the opening and closing are both beautiful. This is very different from other Crique i saw, this one is more artful. So far, it is my best Cirque du Soleil i have... but i dont have much experience in other show :)"
Beatles Love,"all you need is love love love...love is all you need.

awesome performance, music, dancing, and little bit acrobatics. 
nice stage floor designs. 
were sitting at the balcony 1st row, enjoy it very much, because we can see everything from this angle. although i think the best view are from section 2 (200 &amp; 209), section 1 would be to close and youll miss some of the performance around you, thats just my opinion.
the theater is not that big so dont worry about having bad seats.

most parts/ songs are beautifully arranged and choreographed, but few are loosing the grips that why i gave four stars, overall its an amazing experience.
you dont need to be a beatles fan to watch this,"
Beatles Love,"Beatles music, imaginative performances including both dance and acrobatics, made you smile and remember back.  Would probably be a blast to see stoned.  Good pour of scotch outside which you can bring into theatre.  What more do you want from a show?  Not my first Cirque show and wont be my last.  These performers are just wonderful."
Beatles Love,The show is visually stunning! The stage and all the visuals are just amazing. Best show Ive ever seen.
Beatles Love,Our group of 9 were very disappointed.  I wish we could get a refund.  The show relied very heavily on the Beatles music to pull through its weight but it wasnt enough.  I would have much rather seen Mystere again or nothing at all.  Love didnt have enough Cirque to it and had more interpretive dance which we were not a fan of.
Beatles Love,"outstanding! i loved everything about this show. it was my first cirque show and i was beyond impressed! the acrobatics, the dancing, the music, it left me loving the beatles even more than before. the stage is round so there really isnt a bad seat, no matter where you are you can see everything. the show was just fantastic!"
Beatles Love,"I was not a Beatles fan, then I saw the show, on a whim, and totally pleasantly surprised!

We had balcony seats with limited viewing for 90 some dollars, and the show was still incredible! The stage was in the middle of the theatre, and surrounded all around by seats--we could see everything. The costumes design, the best of Beatles music marathon style, lighting, and whatnot all fit perfectly together like one grand musical. The dancers delivered theatrical, professional, beautiful dance moves.

I cant imagine what it would have been like if I were a long-time Beatles fan. When it ended I wanted to see it immediately again. I would definitely go back and experience it with better seats.

However, if youre looking for acrobatics I would recommend another Cirque show."
Beatles Love,"Worth every penny-- and dont worry over your seats, spectacular views everywhere. Great cast! If youre weary about watching people climb ropes, and do twirls, this is not what Love is about. Love is a happening!"
Beatles Love,"40percent off for Nevada residents right now.

I love how so many yelpers took so many awesomely illegal pictures of the show!

Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. I loved."
Beatles Love,"This was my first Cirque Du Soliel show and I really didnt know what to expect. I love the Beatles music and thought this would be the perfect way to gear up for the Rock Band game coming in September by going to the show while on vacation. 

Best idea I ever did.

This was probably one of the best shows Ive ever seen. There was not a bad seat in the whole place. It felt interactive and the speakers in the seats really got you into the experience. Purchased a Coke for 6 bucks and got to keep the huge cup too, which made it feel like I didnt need a t-shirt from the shop or anything.

I would definitely see this again because this had to be one of the best parts of my vacation. Although my Venetian gondola ride guy did say that Cirque Du Soleil will be starting an Elvis show next year..."
Beatles Love,"Loved it. Unlike the other cirque shows - this one is less about the acrobatics and completely about choreography, art design, visuals, all set beautifully to the evergreen Beatles music - Takes one through the complete emotional range, and is a fantastic journey, especially for someone that has grown up listening to the Beatles. Would highly recommend this to anyone, and a must watch for people that feel all cirque shows seem the same after youve seen a couple."
Beatles Love,"hey, jude, imagine lucy in the sky with diamonds and a yellow submarine in an octopuss garden in the shade.  ok, enough with the corny jokes.  this show was freaking awesome!!  definitely one of my fave cirque du soleil shows!!  it was like a history lesson on acid during a beatles concert.  how can you top that?  cirque du soleil, you never cease to amaze me!  if i could, i would have rated this show 29.4 bajillion stars"
Beatles Love,"ASTOUNDING.

You will be so torn when the show is over.  Part of you will be glad it is over so you can go talk about it for the rest of the night.  Part of you will be so sad that it is over and will be trying to figure out if you can get tickets for the next nights show!  

It is a perfectly directed and designed show.  You will be amazed at everything that is going on.  To think of the rehearsal time that had to go into the show is astounding.

I have seen all the Cirque shows in Vegas and this one brings in the best of all of them in my opinion...the acrobatics of Mystere, the ballet elements of O, and the engineering marvel of Ka.  It ups all of them a notch.

The energy in the show is dense and I recommend you let yourself get caught up in it.  It will be a memorable show if you do."
Beatles Love,"I saw this show in December 2011.  I was basically forced to see this show, as I was uninterested due to not being a Beatles fan.  I thought that the show was entertaining.  It just wasnt really what I was expecting, it was a lot of dancing to the songs and jumping around.  Fortunately when we got the tickets it was super cheap due to all the proceeds were going to a childrens fund which was nice.  Would I see it again? No.  Would I recommend it? Only if you like the beetles."
Beatles Love,"I got free front row tickets for this show and wasnt sure what to expect. It turns out that although I hate the Beatles, the show was terrific."
Beatles Love,"I didnt listen to the Beatles, neither did my parents.  My expectations werent high, I got the tickets for my wife.  

I really liked the show for two reasons.  1) The show was done as a period-piece including some of the historical background for why songs were written.  The stage had opaque screens that at first were confusing/distracting, but once you understood how the show unfolded you got why the screens existed.  The screens help set the context for the Beatles songs.  2) The stage and music made for a really fun show.  Other Cirque shows dont have the same amount of joy that this one has, the performers just danced to the music as a part of the routine and it all flowed. Some of the visually striking aspects of the show, including a big flowing white sheet that I thought was remarkable, made this an interesting show to attend."
Beatles Love,"This was the ONLY thing that made my first and last trip to Vegas worthwhile. IT was absolutely amazing and even though Im not a big Beatles fan it was a friggin blast. I even caught myself a few times saying wow out loud. Beautiful, fun, just an awesome time. GO SEE IT."
Beatles Love,"my favorite show so far in Vegas... loved all the music, great visuals... all over i felt great by the time i left the theater... Made me love the Beatles even more than i already did."
Beatles Love,"to me another show with the cirque stamp to make you pay the cirque price.. the show was fun and intresting and at times mind bending but the one thing i had an issue with was that there was SOOO much going on at times you felt like you were missing out. also there wasnt many acrobatics in the show more like coreography to the beatles music itself. all in all i did enjoy it and its worth a watch especially if you like the beatles...but if you want to be completly WOWd by the vegas cirque XP, try out KA or O. :)"
Beatles Love,"This is a really good show. The only thing is, if you dont like the Beatles, you might not like is as much as other Cirque shows."
Beatles Love,best 90 minutes of my lifeeeeeee! amazingamazingamazing!!!
Beatles Love,This is definitely one of the weaker Cirque du Soleil shows.  Not worth your time or money.  Its mostly just people in odd costumes running around the stage for 90 minutes.  The acrobatics and choreography are weak.  There are far better ways to spend your time and money in Vegas.
Beatles Love,"Absolutely fantastic. Id been wanting to check it for some time and had seen the original Cirque du Soleil years ago. I will admit I probably didnt splurge on Love sooner because Im not that into the Beatles. Turns out I didnt have to as I was fortunate enough to score tickets in October from the nice folks at Cirque to review the show (they are so much fun follow them on twitter @cirque). This blew away any show Ive seen in Vegas and Ive been to many over the years. It was magical, fun, and emotional - you are taken on a journey through past times, wars, and different discoveries of love and humanity translated through mind blowing acrobatics and dance. The minute you walk into the theater you enter a psychedelic atmosphere of fantasy and characters from the concession stand to your seat. I was a little bit lost on character roles but no matter, did I mention it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G? Every seat is a good seat at this show. My only advice would be to sit mid to back row vs. front row for full view - much of the performance happens in the air - and to stay out of the way of some of the special affects, unless you like being part of the show."
Beatles Love,"This wasnt my favorite Cirque show, but I really liked it.  I enjoy the Beatles, but not a die hard fan or anything.  Initially I wasnt going to see this show as I thought the tickets were a bit pricey, but I did get a discount on tickets directly through the Mirage website.  We were in the 300s section and they were great seats.  I dont think I would have wanted to be much closer for fear of missing something.  There is a lot going on in this show.  A lot of special effects."
Beatles Love,"Words cannot describe just how spectacularly phenomenal this show really is. This is the best Cirque du Soleil show Ive ever seen in Vegas and anywhere else for that matter. Im not a huge Beatles fan, so I was a little nervous that I wouldnt understand the show. Once I figured out that the show is basically an interpretation of each song, I started to really love it. No pun intended. Plus, I recognized a lot of their songs, which made it that much more enjoyable. And, it was cool how there were speakers built into each chair so we all had uber surround sound. I would definitely see it again, maybe in a few years. I cant wait!"
Beatles Love,"WOW I cant explain how great of a show this is!!! At first I was concerned this show will ruin my love to the beatles, but no!!!! This show did not in any way shame the beatles name"
Beatles Love,"I have grown up on The Beatles, with some of my earliest musical memories including riding in my dads 76 Pontiac with Sgt. Pepper playing on the in-dash eight track player (yes, my dad was king of the Seventies). I know these songs intimately, and yet the music of LOVE was a delightful surprise. Pieces of the master tracks are combined in unexpected ways, creating a sound unheard before but at the same time totally familiar. The audio is enhanced by a sound system that I think even surpasses the one in the KA theatre at the MGM, with speakers in the seats, in front of each row, above, below, and in the surround. The theatre seating is in the round, which at first had me concerned that we would miss elements of the show, but the stage direction was so well coordinated that there could not be a bad seat in the house. Maintaining the standard of the other resident Cirque shows, the costuming, props, dancing, and acrobatics are a feast for the eyes. Simply amazing.

Once you see LOVE I highly recommend viewing the documentary All Together Now which chronicles the development of the show from a conversation between George Harrison and Guy LaLiberte into the spectacle of the final form."
Beatles Love,"Good show but not great.   Im probably ranking this lower because Ive seen the other shows and was expecting better.  This is the 4th cirque dul soleil show Ive seen in Vegas with my wife and I would rank it 3rd after Ka and O.  Zumanity would be 4th.   The melding of the music and acrobatics were great and is definitely a must see if you are a fan of the music.   The only part that I didnt really like is the 3 minute interlude where you watch the movie screen playing a 70s to 80s style cartoons.   Other than that, it is good overall.   But it didnt have the same affect on me as Ka and O"
Beatles Love,"one word - LOVE. period, done. everyone that gave this rating three stars or less - have one thing to say, all you need is love."
Beatles Love,Love Love.  I was lucky enough to sit in Yoko Onos seat and the experience was absolutely breathtaking.  Everything about the show was so beautiful and moving.  It makes me wish I was alive during the 60s.
Beatles Love,"What I appreciated equally with the stage sets, costumes, art direction AND songs, is that this Cirque performance made a genuine effort to be politically correct (i.e., memories of war-torn Lebanon; and Strawberry Fields was an actual place where John Lennon, as a child, had visited with orphan children--which explains the recurring theme of children in the bed throughout the show) while still keeping it light (the fun blue sheet of ocean pulled over the audience with an elusive yellow submarine). I dont want to give it all away--but I do think that a familiarity with the Beates songs--not only lyrics, but meaning of person, place and thing--adds a whole nuther dimension to enjoying LOVE. Having to be fair in my review, and since it is a personal opinion, I didnt like the character of Satan hi atop a trapeze with the lit-up King over his head; I think any person of faith would feel that this could have been left out and no one would have been remiss for it; were it not for that I would have a hard time finding any flaws since art imitates life and life imitates art."
Beatles Love,"This is a great show. I was wowed by it from start to finish. The gigantic drinks that they sell are also pretty delicious. The costumes and set changes that occur in this show are amazing. If you are in Vegas and are on the fence about seeing this show, just go and see it. You will not be upset that you made that decision. I would also add if youve seen Corteo and enjoyed it, you will probably like this show as it shares similar elements with Corteo."
Beatles Love,"After seeing all the great reviews, I had high expectations for this show. We sat in section 209 row P and had a pretty good view of the entire stage. Since Ive seen two other Cirque shows before I was expecting more acrobatic and stunts and not as much dancing.   I guess it did not help that I got stuck sitting right in front of a drunk guy. His ranting of obscenities and shrill whistling every few minutes definitely distracted me from enjoying the greater half of the show until his wife was kind enough to finally make him leave. He was warned by a  staff member prior to the start of the show but once the show started not a single usher was seen.  If they knew someone was a problem, you would think they would better monitor the situation. After the show ended my bf went to complain and they claimed they kicked him out of the show midway, which was funny because we did not notice anyone coming near our area asking him to leave.  At least they did take a little bit of responsibility and refunded a portion of my ticket back.  Maybe if I was not so agitated in the beginning I couldve given the show a higher rating."
Beatles Love,"I hafta agree with Christine K...i was zoning in and out during the whole show.  granted, I was already super tired that day, but overall i just thought the show was Ok.  there were parts of it that i thought were really awesome, mostly the acrobatic sections of it.  But other parts of the show were really slow, confusing, and just not that interesting.  Even the opening act, for example, lacked enough oomph to get the show started.  As for the white sheet being lifted over the audience, I was actually seated above it, so it looked really cool from my vantage point...i did wonder what it looked like underneath though. I did have an issue with the way the walls were partitioned though...especially at my seat level, it just cut the stage in weird spots, and at times, blocked my view of the artists performing on the stage.  Im glad i got the buy 1 ticket, get the second one for $25 deal, because otherwise i definetly would not have thought i got my moneys worth on this show.  As it is, even with the promotion, its a close call."
Beatles Love,best show i have ever seen! my husband loved loved loved it!  yes yes yes for sure pay to see this show when in vegas!!!!!!!!!!
Beatles Love,"Ive been to many Cirque shows in Vegas and this is by far my favorite!!  It helps being a Beatles fan so you know the songs, and what they are trying to act out.  Clever dance steps and awesome high flying acrobatics!!  If you do not like Beatles music, you can appreciate the soundtrack and all the action that is going on.  They have roller blading quarter pipes, nets and a telephone booth that they flip off of, a live swing that an acrobat flips around on, only the magic of Cirque Du Soleil knows how to perfect!!  Ive been to this show more than once because in my opinion, it is better than O , Mystere, and Ka.  However if you are more into classical music I would suggest the other shows.  The soundtrack is rock/pop/hip-hop. The Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound built into the seat makes it feel like the Beatles are there with you live.  What a moving performance!  You will forever be changed into the world that is Beatlemania!! Any seat in the house is a good view so dont feel like you wont be able to see....but there is a special treat for some who are close enough to go under the big top.  (A yellow submarine tent pops out)"
Beatles Love,Awesome show that is full of surprises. Its great to be able to sing along to all of the songs. Fantastic show that wont disappoint. Very entertaining and left you wanting more.
Beatles Love,"I went back again as promised. This time with 8 of us in the front row. It was even better. The first time around we saw the beta production. I think they simply polished up a few things. This is still my favorite work of theatre, dance, music etc. Everyone in the group wanted to go back the very next night. Keep up the great work Love!"
Beatles Love,"Love Love!  Truly this was a breathtaking experience.  The artistry, music, directing, choreography -- wow!  My absolutely favorite moment is in the beginning when the first big rock and roll song is played -- the place is jumping!!!  So many unexpected and creative moments, this is a triumph!"
Beatles Love,"Basically felt the same was as Matt H and I believe we must have been at the same show (6/19 7PM show), however we did get our tickets at half price. Have been to one other Cirque show (Quidam) which we really enjoyed that had more amazing moments. This was definitely more about the dancing then the acrobatics which was fine, but felt a little let down based on our previous experience and maybe our expectations were too high based on what others who had seen it told us :)"
Beatles Love,"Much better than I expected.  Sat on Row S in section 209 and honestly I would not have changed my seat even if I could.  These the were honestly the best seats in the house, and at about 60 bucks a ticket totally worth it.  The show is amazing! I will admit the opening scene was a little weird but after that I totally loved it.  The show was super colorful and just a feel good show.  Lots of dancing which was alright with me and some of the best acrobatics I have ever seen.  It helps that I love the beatles but everyone else I went with didnt really like the beatles but absolutely loved the show.  Definately the most creative cirque since they take the story from the lyrics of the songs and the show is in the round.  One of the best shows in vegas.  Amazing special effects and the  sound system for the theatre is awesome.  My favorite scene was Get Back.  It totally blew my mind.  Go see this show!"
Beatles Love,"This show was amazing.  I was a bit hesitant on whether I wanted to watch it because Im not a fan of the beatles, although I did grow up listening to their music (thanks to my brother, who is a lot older than I am), so I knew most of the songs, but even if youve never heard their songs, I think youd enjoy the music, of course I may be wrong about that. :P  Also, I didnt know what to expect, I knew that it wouldnt be like the other cirque shows, and Im glad that it wasnt.  Wasnt really looking forward to watching one of their regula acrobatic shows.  The show is more artsy, concentrating more on the beatles songs.  There was not a boring moment.  The only thing I found annoying was the layout of the show.  We sat in the 3rd row in section 103 and I thought it wasnt centered enough and was a bit too close.  The theater is quite small, so you dont really need to sit up front.  Also, I was lucky enough to get some sort of a student discount and they also have other promotions going on.  Its best to call them and ask before reserving your tickets."
MJ One,"Yelp doesnt allow me enough space to say how FING AMAZING this is.
I laughed.  I cried.  I danced in my seat.  I stood up and danced.  I was enthralled.   This is THE SHOW to see in Vegas.

Now it helps if you are a Michael Jackson fan...  I am.  Hardcore.  But even if youre just a bit of a MF fan, this will be amazing to see.  If you want to come here with a political point of view about MJ, this will not make you happy and dont waste your money...  this show isnt cheap and its for the fans.  And if youre a fan... this is two hours of majesty.  

I dont want to spoil the show...  the lights are incredible...  I am madly in love with the staging...  The dancing is - well didnt he teach us all how to dance?  He changed the way people dance.   And his signature moves are on display here in a way that makes it clear that MJ was the one that did it first.  

They made so many good choices...  NO ONE else can ever do Michaels iconic performance of Billie Jean when he did the Moon Walk for the first time...  its breathtaking to see Michael do it - no one can ever do this as well as he did.   And they were smart to not try to usurp that.  The shots of MJ as a kid...  yeah, I cried.  And the paparazzi message is hit really hard (the paps in the pre-show accosted me...  I did not enjoy that) and the show doesnt need the Cirque fussinesses about people from the audience suddenly being a part of the show...  We get IT.   This isnt about Cirque...  this is about MJ.  

Everyone was dancing and singing along and sometimes crying.   This genius left us way too soon.  The subtext is that he was tortured by the media.  I know it.  I believe it.  Listening to two hours of his most amazing songs - including some deep tracks - was absolutely positively worth the high ticket price.   The theater is set up so that there really isnt a bad view but if you want to be really a part of this amazing thing, spring for the first 10 rows.  This isnt a typical Cirque show with a lot of over the top acrobatics and you want to see the amazing dancing happening on stage.  

This is the BEST thing to see in Las Vegas.  If you arent dancing in your seat you came to the wrong party.  We forget how many INCREDIBLE jams this man created.  The guitar gal is hot but also reminds us that while Michael did pop music, he frequently used heavy guitars in his songs and really made ROCK music...  that wouldnt be acceptable by todays pop standards...  but he was a visionary and he liked a real rock guitar.  

And that they did They dont really care about us...  OMG...  So amazing.  I laughed.  I cried.  I danced.  It was SOOO much better than Cats.  Michael Jackson is the King of Pop.  Forever.   What an amazing tribute to him."
MJ One,"The best cirque show Ive seen , it far exceeded my expectations! So much energy from beginning to end, great songs, great dancers, and fun! By the end the crowd including me was singing and dancing, it was great. The other cirque shows Ive seen were a little hard to follow as far as the story but this show was comprehensible and fun, without a doubt I would see it again and again, this is the show to see!"
MJ One,"What can I say... its Michael Jackson
We enjoyed the show our favorite performances were Beat it, Thriller, Man the Mirror, Dont care about us, Earth song and I personally thoroughly enjoyed Ill be there ....

Great visuals- lighting 

Awesome Threatre, comfortable seats and sound 

Cirque du Soleil always does a great job with exception to one (no longer performing at Luxor).  

Even Elvis at Aria was great ! Im not sure why they closed it."
MJ One,"No matter how your the of Michael Jackson, no one can deny his talent! The cast was so incredibly talented! Our seats were $225 each but it was totally worth it! Its a Must See for sure!"
MJ One,"The show had some terrific moments but overall for a Cirque du Soleil show wasnt up to the standard of what Ive seen at other Cirque shows. 

The good:
- Incredible set with amazing effects, including tons of video of MJ and even a number that has a hologram version of him dancing 
- Great acoustics and sound 
- The last several numbers were incredible and fun to watch 

The bad:
- A lot of it, to me, was boring. Maybe it was because we had pretty far back seats but being a Cirque show i was expecting more stunts and acrobats and it was mostly just dancing. I thought I was seeing a circus show, not dancing. LOVE about the Beatles is much more acrobatic. 
- Some numbers require you to be super close to tell whats going on. I think there was a bit about his shoes and gloves but it was just one guy and I couldnt tell. 

Again, the last several numbers were really entertaining but I found myself checking my watch many times during the show. Id probably only recommend it if youre a huge Michael Jackson fan; if not, theres many other better shows in Vegas."
MJ One,"I cant dont have words to speak to this experience.  Here is my effort to try and explain what this show did for me:

Cried like a baby - over and over, I grew up on MJ and he is the real deal
Mind Blowing talent - never seen such talent, Broadway is shamed by this group
Could not stop singing: every word every song every performance

It took forever for me to see it, and I want to see it again and again."
MJ One,"Spectacular!!
This is a must see show if you are looking for a great MJ experience..
 
PRO+
Youll enjoy every single song.
Believe or not, theres music &amp; sound effects coming out of your seat.
Lights are super cute.

Con-
Not enough performers in some acts that We understand the stage shouldve been amazingly crowded and louder. But it wasnt a sold out show so I guess they didnt give us the whole version.

Not a lot from Cirque du Soleil here, not enough acrobatic act, voices or makeup."
MJ One,"This show was everything!!   It is worth seeing.  My husband and I enjoyed it from beginning and sadly to the end.   They showcased Michael at his best and the sounds were unbelievable.   Each seat had sounds in the back of the headsets....   

The dancers were on point.   Their outfits were super cute!   I wished I was dancing right along with them on stage!!! 

I was most impressed with the aerial tricks and the moonwalking along the wall.   I also loved the dancers as they were all individually outlined and lit up.   

The entire production was executed flawlessly and Im certain that they did the Jackson family proud and I know the late Michael Jackson would have been pleasantly pleased with their performance.

What a vacation!!!!"
MJ One,"We were looking for a nice Vegas show to watch over the weekend while visiting Vegas for a wedding. Weve seen O at the Bellagio and Love by the Beatles at the Mirage. So I was going back and forth between Ka , mystere and Michael Jackson One. 

To be honest, MJ One is the most expensive out of the three.. but after seeing a video ad, I knew this would entertain us. For one, the songs are familiar. 

I found a great deal on the Mandalay site..offering Flash discounts.. so for the seats we got, the regular price  wouldve been $187/pax... but with the discount, I got them for $107/pax or $127/pax inclusive of taxes and booking fees. So it truly was a great deal. For a big family of 5, any savings is a blessing! 

We got our tickets at WillCall and the theater opened at 9pm. 
We easily found our seats and noticed the cool stage. The design was projected and it expanded through the sides of the theater.

Prior to the start, there were actors who engaged the audience. So it was fun to watch. 

This show, you would want to either be in the middle rows or a little bit elevated. You would not want to be up too close or be too far away. 

The stage effects, props and costumes were just mind blowing! I will not spill here what they show to give you something to look forward to filled with surprises.

The dancers totally rocked it and brought the house down! At some point, I even almost cried thinking of how this amazing Artist Michael Jackson lived a life full of criticism yet he left us musical memories we can all enjoy for a lifetime! 

Out of all the Cirque Shows, this one is definitely my favorite! So, go watch it and be fully entertained, worth every penny it charges!"
MJ One,Wasnt sure what expect but was pleasantly surprised. The show was so entertaining and the story delightfully presented. Incorporating MJs music throughout. If you love Michael Jacksons music you will love this show.
MJ One,"I was totally blown away.... this show FAR exceeded my expectations! I have been to many different cirque shows and this is the first time I didnt feel like I was watching just another one.  

It was more  a beautiful musical tribute to one of my favorite performers who I miss dearly.  The tumbling the dancing the trampolines the people dancing in the sky on wires it was all just amazing nonstop magical performances one after another.  The performer on the rope just blew me away I loved watching his moves he was amazing. The Michael Jackson hologram had me in tears.  I am so thankful I got to see Michael Jackson concert.   I would recommend this show over all others in Vegas.   Ive seen many shows in my 60+ years but this by far was the best!   That includes Broadway shows that dont touch this level of Talented and amazing performers.   

Michael Jackson was and always will be the King of Pop!"
MJ One,Great show with great music. Definitely a tribute to Michael Jackson. Good performances and dances. I wanted more acrobatics considering it was from cirque du soleil.
MJ One,"Im surprised they have not dropped this show yet ! Micheal , Ive always loved your music but Im sad at what you did . However , I saw this show 4 times and cried . I saw it 4x before his dirty deed aired on Oprah . I still love his music and I have to put that away in my mind so I can enjoy his one and only kind of music . The show blew me away ! I still love his music and I can forgive you..."
MJ One,"This show was beyond excellent! From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out. Michael Jackson was and still is the King of Pop. The performances were amazing. The songs were our favorites and a couple of never heard before. 
This show bring emotions out of you ..especially if youre a huge fan. I sat in Row D seats 8,9,10.
Those were perfect seats for anyone wanting to be close. 
My only regret was not seeing Michael Jackson in concert growing up."
MJ One,I didnt know how emotional it would for me but as soon as Michaels image came on the screen I couldnt hold it in. It was just incredible. I think they did a really good job of connecting the songs with the acts. And Heal the World - I forget how some of his music was so socially conscious. It just was amazing - I think anyone who likes cirque de soleil would love this. But if you are like me and grew up with Michael Jackson will LOVE it!
MJ One,"My first Cirque du Soleil and now it certainly wont be my last.  Michael Jackson One was amazing.  It is an experience like none other and for someone that is not emotional like me, the total experience brought lots of emotion to me.  I cant compare to other Cirque du Soleil and I know they are different.  I thought their artistic expression of a musical legend was simply amazing.  From one act to another, I kept asking for more!  The hologram piece and trampoline piece was probably my favorites that stood out.  It is certainly worth the price of admission.  I dont think there is a bad seat but obviously you want to be closer if you can.  I loved the music selection and the talent was amazing.  Great dancers, great acrobatics and some very unique performances.  Sorry for not being able to capture some pictures because 1. we werent allowed to and, 2. I was glued to the performance and as we left, I kept talking about it rather than grabbing my phone to snap pictures."
MJ One,"Total performers all of the crew are awesome!!! I just love everything about it, starts in time so make sure be there on time. Love the photos being taken before the show. Just said they didnt play one of fav song but its cool. I wish the show was longer!!!!!! Definitely worth the money!!!!! Must watch!!!!!"
MJ One,"Theres a place in your Heart, and I know that it is LOVE..... ~Michael Jackson

Sunday, 10.22.18 -- completely SOLD OUT!

Located at the Mandalay Bay Hotel &amp; Casino -- and so fittingly so.... It was indeed a somber sad feeling on our Lyft ride over to MB... as we even passed the very lot where so many Beautiful souls were lost.. (yet gained:)) 

I feel like this show emphasizes all the PEACE, LOVE, &amp; GOODWILL Michael stood for.... :))

In a world filled with hate, we must still dare to HOPE. In a world filled with anger, we must still dare to COMFORT. In a world filled with despair, we must still dare to DREAM. And in a world filled with distrust, we must still dare to BELIEVE.... ~Michael Jackson 

You will see his words in the show.... :)) 

A Worthy Tribute to MANDALAY BAY.... 
A Worthy Tribute to such a LEGEND....
Remember. Honor.
Rest in Light &amp; Love MJ and all you Beautiful Beautiful Souls..... 

Theres a place in Your Heart and I know that it is LOVE.... 
HEAL THE WORLD.... MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE..... =)"
MJ One,Great performance. Been to all the Cirque de Soleil shows and by far the best. So entertaining and bringing my daughter for her birthday is something she will never forget. She even had performers come by and say hi to her making her feel do special. Will see it again. Must see!
MJ One,Beautiful show. Couldve had more stunts as Ive seen in other shows but the best part to me was the last minute when they were using sign language to say it doesnt matter if youre black or white. As someone whose family speaks with sign language it made my day! Thank you for adding this in and recognizing how it should be done more often whenever possible!
MJ One,"This was an amazing show!! What a beautiful tribute to MJs career. Photography is prohibited and this was all I could get from inside before it started. Acrobatic show was amazing!!! Highly recommend this if youre in Vegas! Semi-kid friendly ...occasionally colorful language. Lots of diversity in the performance crew, which I really loved. Different styles of acrobatic activities...kept you on the edge of your seat."
MJ One,"Best performance ever!
Im always so impressed with all the cirque shows in Vegas. For this one, it has less acrobatics but more dancing with beautiful MJ songs. Its very intense yet meaningful with a lot of bright lights and laser which gave me goosebump everywhere. I was just in awe the whole time. Michael Jackson is such a legendary artist! 
I cant wait to see all the cirque they have in the area!
Thank you very much!!!"
MJ One,"This is my second time watching a Cirque du Soleil production in Vegas.  The other one was good but I didnt enjoy it as much.  I was super excited to attend Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay.  The theater is very spacious and has stadium seating.  The seats are super comfortable.  We were in Section 102 (center) which were awesome seats.  

Pre-show you can check out the souvenir store or grab some popcorn and cocktails at the concession.  You are allowed to take it into the theater.  There is no dress code.  The ushers were all decked out in MJ uniforms.  The theater opens about 30 minutes before showtime.  

As you walk into the theater, youll be amazed by the massive 3D screen that surrounds the stage.  Dont be alarmed if the paparazzi (actors) approach you to take photos.  Its all part of the show. 

The performance was spectacular all throughout the one hour and 30 minutes.  I enjoyed all the MJ classics: Thriller, Smooth Criminal, Billie Jean, Dirty Diana, Bad, Beat It and a few more.  The lighting, visual effects, and acrobatics were amazing. The performers are all talented.  The choreography and MJ dance moves were the best!

If youre in town, this is the show to see especially if you are an MJ fan!  You will be entertained until the finale.  It makes you want to dance and sing along.  This past month commemorated the 60th Birthday of the King of Pop.  His legacy keeps on rocking!!"
MJ One,"This was mine &amp; my familys first Cirque du Soleil show because it was highly recommended by so many people (especially for kids). I must say I am a big fan of MJ &amp; was entertained mostly because of the background music of his own. The actual entertainers were just okay. Important to arrive on time &amp; not come with a backpack! Wish I had known that.
To top it off, towards the last twenty minutes of the show we were just sitting in a dark theater! This went on for a good 20 minutes. They never really told us what happened?
Kids were entertained until the length gap but not really a show I would watch again."
MJ One,"If youre looking for a show for everyone this show is it! Tickets start around $100 but you can find deals at discount sellers or if you sign up for rewards programs. The show and theater are dedicated to the Michael Jackson story. When you enter there is memorabilia from the Jackson estate. Everyone who works there is dressed like members of the media/paparazzi. The dancing is amazing as well. Lots of moonwalking as you might guess but also everyone is a great dancer. A few cirque wows with aerial stunts but if youre looking for an acrobatic show this probably isnt it. 

Best part is the theater is small enough that there are no bad seats. The back row can see the stage clearly and well."
MJ One,"Terrific MJ-themed show with lots of dancing, unique stage effects, circus elements, and stagecraft! We were wowd by the whole spectacle and integration with the music. Theres a pretty abstract storyline (typical) and some parts are a little weird but thats what you came for right?! And parents .. just be aware that there may be some scantily clad dancers for your viewing pleasure.

Thrilleeeeeerrrrrrrr!!!!!!"
MJ One,"If youre a Michael Jackson fan, this is a must see. I grew up listening to his music but I didnt realize how much of his music I didnt know. The performance was wonderful. My husband and I got seats behind one another on the 2nd and 3rd row. There was so much going on that it was hard to see what was behind you and on the sides that close up. My recommendation is to get seats in egg middle of the theater so you dont miss anything."
MJ One,"I grew up listening to Michael Jacksons music and am a total kid of the 80s. I was super excited to see this show and expected to love it.  I was disappointed. Ive seen MANY Cirque du Soleil shows and this is one of the most disappointing. 

The MJ music was great and that didnt disappoint. The show was odd and uninspired. The story line was weak (magic Michael Jackson items that appear to be imbued with powers). 

Many Cirque shows have a stage that comes out into the audience, but this was much more audience in one place and flat stage. Yes, there were instances where performers flew above you, but it was still not as immersive as it could be.

My biggest criticism is the complete lack of enthusiasm of the performers. It looked like they were just going through the motions and absolutely not giving it their all. It looked like we were watching a so-so rehearsal. 

The best parts of the show were the pre-show photos (on the walls) entertainment and the Thriller portion of the show. 

I think its time to either shut this show down or completely revamp/re-imagine it. 

If in Vegas and looking for a Cirque show, go to LOVE or O or Ka instead."
MJ One,"I found this very relaxing. Its an intimate theater. I liked the moon walker, the light up track suits, and many other aspects. Its amazing the talent the performers have. Im glad its still open despite the recent backlash HBO stirred up."
MJ One,"This will not disappoint! In my opinion its the best show in Vegas.  They did Michael proud for sure! Of course the music is on point but the dancing is incredible!!!!! Like so amazingly great! If youre in Vegas, go see this!"
MJ One,"On my last night in Vegas, my mom, a friend, and I went to see the Michael Jackson One Cirque du Soleil show (hubby was too tired).  Ive seen a couple of Cirque du Soleil shows in Vancouver, and while they were cool and fun to watch, Im not in love with Cirque.  However, this show was a little different than the standard Cirque shows, with more dancing than acrobatics.

As expected, the show was set to various Michael Jackson songs, and the performers were amazing -- there was even a dancer with one leg!  Now the reason why Im giving the show three stars instead of four or five is that I dont know many Michael Jackson songs (yes, Im a weirdo), so while it was a great show, I definitely would have gotten more out of it if I were a big MJ fan.  But the show was pretty cool, and if youre an MJ fan, youll love it.

One thing to note that I didnt like: during one of the performances, fake snow fell on the crowd.  The fake snow was made of soap or foam or something, and while it disappeared after a few minutes, it did leave faint marks on my black shirt (they washed out, but I wasnt planning on washing my clean shirt until I wore it a couple more times), and there were foamy bits stuck in my hair, so I had to wash it the next day.  So beware of that -- your hair will get messed up and you will probably have to wash your clothes! 

[Yelp collections: Vegas 2018]"
MJ One,"Wow!!! This show is FANTASTIC!!

Besides showcasing our Favorite MJ songs BILLIE JEAN &amp; THRILLER, the show had a beautiful montage of younger MJ singing ILL BE THERE!

The song choices were Excellent and so appropriate for these stressful times!

I love MJ singing SMILE! Who doesnt?

The choregraphy was beautiful and awesome. Between dancers floating from up above to dancers on the side of the stage! 

Acrobats jumping so high on trampolines to doing high flying flips across the stage!

Jugglers doing amazing things with their hats and tossing them to other jugglers!

There even was a great magician using the infamous White Sparkly Glove

There was always so much activity...just like a 3 Ring Circus!!

The best part was  ending the show with MJ iconic song: BLACK &amp; WHITE!!

So entertaining to watch these talented performers!

A must see!"
MJ One,"Where do I even begin this review!! If you are a Michael Jackson fan ..... or even if you are not, you will LOVE this show!! It blew my mind and Ive seen almost all the Cirque du Soleil shows. From the lighting, to the production, to the performers..... just wow wow wow! 

The show is about an hour and a half and it goes by fairly quickly as you are taken on this spectacular journey of all the Michael Jacksons classics.

I was bobbing my head and singing the lyrics as the show progressed and it was just freakin awesome. 

There really isnt anything bad to say except that the snacks are super expensive which can be expected at shows. 

Upon entry to the show you walk through a metal detector but this is fairly quick. We arrived at 6:40 pm and we got in and had enough time to buy some snacks before going to our seats. The show starts promptly at 7pm. We booked in section 205 row KK and it was great seats. I think all the seats would be great because of how the theatre is set up. 

If you havent yet booked your tickets, do it now!"
MJ One,"A great tribute to the late Michael Jackson, this show does a fantastic job of combining a variety of art forms with not only his music but also his philosophy of spreading love and hope instead of hate.

Located at Mandalay Bay, there is a Michael Jackson ONE theater dedicated to the show. The staff moves the lines to get in quickly, but Id still recommend getting there a little early to get through bag check and security, buy any food or drinks, and enjoy some of the pre-show activities before getting to your seat - it started not long after the official time!

The show didnt hold any punches and had us engaged right from the get-go! Without giving too much away, there was a wide range of impressive acrobatics - everything from your usual Cirque to silks, tightrope, poledancing, trampoline, and more, along with more choreography and dancing, which was perfectly paired with Michaels music. Every seat seemed like a good one since there was always something to look at! They utilized the whole stage effectively and would even drop in from the ceiling or through the audience itself at times!

For big fans of MJ, there were all of his classic songs incorporated into the show, blended together with a story to follow and helping to build the mood with each act. Every scene was set beautifully, with lights, different screens, and special effects drawing you in. And although Michael himself was not there, you could almost feel his presence through a plethora of voiceovers and video clips (plus a special hologram surprise!).

Overall, the show had us throughly entertained from start to finish and did well in honoring the late singer. Definitely worth watching while in Vegas!"
MJ One,"Excellent show!!!! Dont like the booking method (its that company that racks up the fees when buying online). 

Show: My wife and I were impressed. Pre-show we were talking about various MJ songs and hoped they would find a way to incorporate them and they did. The four characters that were recurring throughout were entertaining. This is definitely a show I would pay to see again.

Venue: Seating seemed to be a bit of a cluster, they do bag and metal detector checks on everyone entering but that could be feasibly moved outside of the pre-show waiting area. The waiting area was really small and crowded before they opened the doors for general seating. The seats were alright, we paid for the ones closer to the front and still had difficulty seeing due to the design of the seats (Im roughly 6 and couldnt see over the person of similar height in front of me). They were passing out booster cushions but we didnt know that until halfway through the show."
MJ One,"Michael Jackson ONE is definitely a must see! 

Everybody will have their favorite MJ songs and ONE creates choreography (or a rendition) for each one. As signature Cirque De Soleil, they have an assortment of acts that leaves the crowd going ohhh and ahhh. Without giving away too much, the hologram of Michael Jackson performing with the stage crew is absolutely amazing.

Check In Process was very smooth, they got us in and seated quickly. The ONE Souvenir Shop is open after the showing, so no need to stop by beforehand!

After doing some research on where ideal seating was, we opted for Section 101 (Left Side) on the Lower Level. We sat in Row J (aisle seats in middle-upper section of lower level), so pretty much everything was eye level. Honestly, based on the seating layout, there isnt a bad view in the house! As far as discount codes go, check out their Facebook page...theyll post up promo codes from time to time.

Id totally be down to watch ONE again. Loved it!

Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Advice? The fake snow sticks to your hair and if you wear black, itll be really apparent! LOL"
MJ One,"Couldnt think of a better way to celebrate a 6 year anniversary than watch the King of Pop.

Im a HUGE CIRQUE fan and this show didnt disappoint. It was an immersive story with amazing visuals, crazy acrobatics, and pre-recorded tracks from the King of Pop. 

Loved that all the Ushers dressed like MJ. 

You will be missed. 

WATCH THIS SHOW. Especially if youre a MJ fan. 

JY"
MJ One,"So good that I shed tears... the best Michael Jackson snow I have ever seen. Played all the best music, did all the right things. I highly recommend this show to anyone coming to Vegas. Everything about it was amazing. All the performers were perfectly executing everything to the highest professional level. 
I wouldnt have changed a thing. Thank you so much for doing MJ right. I loved it from start to finish."
MJ One,"This may be my new favorite Cirque Show! What an amazing production and captivating production. The theatre itself honestly is not very large, category B or even C would be fine seating to see the entire show. The tv screens are in front and on both sides of the theatre making it an immersive experience.

The show has a lot of choreography, acrobatics, and completely revolves around MJ and his music. The costumes are amazing and really go with what they are trying to portray. The one thing I absolutely loved about this show that other cirques do not have is the theatrical effects and technology. They use a lot of lighting and smoke to create amazing effects that blew me away!

This show is very high energy and even if you are not an MJ fan, you will enjoy this production! My favorite scene was thriller and the trampoline team who shocked me! 

A must see show while in Vegas for sure!"
MJ One,"Okay, my expectations were super high. I mean, its Michael Jackson!!  Im guessing there might be some legal reasons why they could not use MJs hit songs. I gave them a three star because of the three songs I like from the entire show. Billy Jean, Thriller and Black or White. Dont get me wrong, there were some older people (late 40s, early 50s) that sang every tune. I was looking for his top hits. 

The Cirque du Soleil performance was okay. Nothing spectacular, but okay to watch. There is a dancer with only one leg that was pretty awesome. The Billie Jean performance was my favorite. Their outfits were all LED looks guys and they performed in pitch black. 

At least I got to mark this show off the bucket list"
MJ One,"Wow...just absolute Wow. This show left me speechless, in utter awe of such a stunning, jaw dropping, tear jerking tribute to the Legend Michael Jackson. Located in the Mandalay Bay hotel, and performed by Cirque du Soleil. When you first enter you are greeted by staff dressed in various Micheal Jackson inspired costumes, you also get to see his actual costumes on display as well. They have a small concession stand where you can grab some light snacks and drinks before the show. I recommend getting there on times as you dont want to miss a thing! There is so many friendly staff, that will guide you or answer any question you may have. Originally we were all the way in the back row(which we didnt mind, as you could still see everything) but before we were seated the lovely staff moved people from in the back to seats much closer. We actually got really lucky and got perfect seats, right in the middle! Im so thankful to the staff for doing that, as this was my first time in Las Vegas and this show truly made it one to remember. The show it self had so much different elements, from dancing, to the music arrangements, to the light show, etc. If you are looking for a show in Las Vegas to see, you must see this ONE!"
MJ One,"Great show! One of the best in Las Vegas! I recommend sitting in the middle, not up front. Its about 1 1/2 hours, comfy seat, pop corn and drinks."
MJ One,"Awesome show but was more like a concert/musical than acrobatic.
Had so much fun though and it kept going....no time to rest or breathe! Haha
We also was able to change our time of the show and got seats thats were a little closer than our original seat but I dont think it was really more in cost originally.

Anyways really great show and the stage and digital effects was awesome.

The theater itself...is small and initimate.
I most seats are good bc the theater is intimate.
The floors were a bit dirty for the 7p show though.
The exit/entrance is a bit small and it leads out to a very crowded narrow hall which gets crazy before and after a show."
MJ One,"I was looking at shows for a month because of the options that cirque provides and MJ really caught my eye. I read reviews and some were mixed - more so relating to seating above anything else. 

So lets just clarify - the show is amazing. Did not disappoint at all. Ive seen cirque before and I all shows present different experiences but I think this really did the music justice. A tour rep said theyd watched it and highly recommended (we got tickets long before arrival so no bias) and said that MJ actually had input on this show prior to his passing. It was uplifting, enteryaining, emotional and kept you wriggling to a beat throughout. 
It is genuinely great. There is so much going on you could watch it multiple times and still enjoy it - thoroughly. Seating wise - we deliberated over this A LOT. We ended up going in the exact middle of the show 6 rows up. Do NOT stress about seat choices, genuinely you could sit anywhere here and get a great view and not miss anything. If we went again - I dont think Id bother with seating in the first 5 rows - its quite close and the cast do things overhead that you might not catch if youre there..however you would get a close up of stage set and isle dancers. Premium seat prices are so for a reason. You wouldnt regret it BUT if the buffet package deal is on for seats in and around D catgeory, absolutely take it! We walked the casino and hotel and then the show at 645 for a 7 start. 
Staff were friendly and helpful all around. Only critique was people attending after show, seemed more or less tired and didnt have the energy like coming in, Other than that. Genuinely great - if you love the music you wont be disappointed. 
No photos as phones not allowed inside and tbh I dont begrudge them that, its worth paying to see.
Will be coming back!"
MJ One,"Id give this show ten stars if I could. Even my husband, who could take or leave Mike, was impressed and applauding this show. Full of creativity, acrobatics, and dance, this show had a lot going on. There was even a segment with an anime cartoon. Definitely a must-see in Vegas."
MJ One,"While its not my favourite out of the 16 Cirque du Soleil shows Ive seen (I want to see them all!), it was a really great and innovative show -- precisely what I expected from Cirque du Soleil in Vegas. I liked the fact that they made the lobby of the venue part of the show, with paparazzi and more!

The use of Michael Jacksons music catalogue to tell a story was pretty neat but it did fall a bit flat too me -- I think I preferred the touring Michael Jackson Cirque show as a celebration of Michael Jacksons career. That said the neat costumes, performances, and multimedia used for this show makes it well worth watching -- especially if you happen to be aware of or a fan of Michael Jackson."
MJ One,This show was epic. I enjoyed this show to the point I got a few tears to my eyes. Extremely powerful to see how they have choreographed a homage to Michael Jackson and I am honored to have been able to experienced it. I still get chills thinking about the show from last night.
MJ One,"So this show gets an upgraded rating from me. The first time i saw the show I was toward the back and to the side.  Seats do matter.  This time was closer to the front and in the center.  What a drastic change to what you can see.

Great performing arts make up this talented show.  There were so many unique and fun segments which keep you entertained all the way through.  Growing up with MJ music during my childhood had me reminiscing when the first time I heard each song.  Singing and dancing arent just part of the show, youll be doing the same in your seat.  

Ill still stand by my original opinion of not having as many acrobatics as some of the others Ive seen.  Nonetheless I think it was an amazing show."
MJ One,"Such a lively and honorable tribute to Michael Jackson through amazing acrobatics, dance, special effects and theatrics.

I will admit, there are fewer daring acts than a typical Cirque Du Soliel show but I still thought it was phenomenal. There is more dance involved, although it was carried out with the same level of energy and precision that youd expect. Not just any ordinary choreographed dance either... Without giving away too much, the creative use of technology really brought this show to life! One act even had them dancing alongside a realistic hologram of Michael Jackson. I especially enjoyed one part where the use of shadows came into play leaving me in awe. This is something you need to see firsthand. 

The show will likely be more memorable for those familiar with Michael Jacksons music, however I wouldnt consider that a must. I had heard only about half the songs, but the show still had that wow factor and kept me engaged throughout. 

As a note, before entering the theater, there is a security check where youll walk through a body scanner and have your belongings checked. I felt safe with these measures in place and didnt notice any similar procedures at other resorts along The Strip. 

Overall a fantastic show that Id highly recommend to anyone. If youre staying at the Mandalay Bay, thats even more of a reason to see it!"
MJ One,"The Cirque MJ One show has me a bit conflicted but Id like to judge this more on the overall enjoyment of the core show on a purely entertainment level rather than an analytical one. (A 3 and a 1/2 star review)

On a purely technical and entertainment level, the show has a lot of the usual Cirque flair and is propped up by MJs signature songs used in interesting ways. Youll go through literally the full gamut of modern dance tricks that if you havent seen the trailers, I wont spoil here. Perhaps nothing super crazy or fascinating but in terms of effects, costume changes, dances, theres a lot to gaggle at here. My highlight is the dancer who comes out as a literal MJ ballerina-like dancer who is amazingly flexible and commands the stage, all without the use of very little effects and just really him dancing. Really, he made the show for me and I could watch that performance for an hour-and-a-half and be happy. 

Row Q, Seats 3-4 by the way are super solid seats and made for a great view of nearly all the proceedings (except for one act that was happening a bit behind us but wasnt super important to the overall performance). 

Personally, the razor thin plot and ultimate conclusion felt weird and uninspired and for someone trying to really analyze the show, its message and meanings, felt detracting. Especially by the final act, it feels like the creative flow of the show ran out of gas to reach its ultimately super weird conclusion that should have been more of a wow factor but ends up not as cool in implementation (and if youre trying to take pictures, expect the ever watchful security to come by to swat your hand away). But Im assuming most people wont go this deep with the show - just my take on what took me away from the show. 

I personally found Ka a much more interesting and fascinating show with more technical feats and a better plotline. But I think most fans of MJ and Cirque will find a lot to like here."
MJ One,"First of all I love MJ. I saw the original MJ cirque show on tour years ago, This permanent show evoked the same feelings but it was a very different experience. 

But before we had a great time...our encounter at the snack counter threatened to sully our evening. 

My friends were in line for their goodies. I took a moment to look a MJ gift items. When I turned around my group was in the front of the line ordering their snacks. I ran up to join them and ordered a bottle of water. 

Jesus yelled at me and started waving his arms and hands at me. He shouted No. you cant order. I thought he was kidding. He said I was too late. He was acting mean and started our anticipated enchanted with a horrible attitude. He kept repeating himself for emphasis. 

It was humiliating. 

I went to another cashier to purchase my water to get away from the aggravated Jesus. 

Luckily for me I was in good company and my friends were able to put this fiasco aside and immerse ourselves in the MJ experience. 

The show was AMAZING. Sad, beautiful, fun, scary (a zombie walked up on us teehee) and exhilarating. Billie Jean and Thriller were out of this world. 

We were dancing in our seats. 

One of my favorite Cirque du Soleil shows. It was part pyrotechnics, magic show, concert, acrobatics. 

So much happens all at once. I could return over and over and see a new show each time. 

5 Stars if Jesus is booted and replaced with a warm and friendly human being with compassion. 

Otherwise, to the performers...

Kudos! Thank you for your passion."
MJ One,"Theres nothing more to add thats not already been said!  This Cirque du Soleil show is incredible and keeps you moving to all of his hits!  I will say that theres a couple of lulls throughout the show that kind of ruined the pace a bit, and therefore it didnt surpass the Beatles Love show in my opinion.  Id still certainly recommend MJ One nonetheless!"

THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF
MY NAUGHTY BUT NICE XXX SOCIAL CALENDAR!

My 3rd trip to Las Vegas in 2018. I have now seen ALL 7 x Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas this year alone!"
MJ One,"This show is breathtaking and I am so happy that this was my first Cirque du Soleil show. I watched this back in April 2017 around spring break and it was worth every penny. It brings you back to the Michael Jackson classics and the way the performers moved their bodies was astonishing. It does not matter where you sit, you will feel engage with the show (I was like in the back corner). Being an acrobatic show, performers are flying over you or they are on the walls. Each performance intertwines so beautifully to make you remember why Michael Jackson is the King and a legend. My favorite performances were Dirty Diana and Billie Jean. I got a little testy eyed when they played Jackson 5. If you like MJ or know someone that does, I highly recommend this show. Its great for all ages.

The venue is small but the seats are quite comfy. There are drink holders and plenty of space to place your gift shop bags. For the entire show, you are sitting down so you dont have to worry about people standing up in front of you like concerts. 

Upon arrival, the waiting line is very long. When you get to the gift shop, it can be crowded. There are people shopping while waiting for the show and then there are people shopping after the show. It can get pretty chaotic. There are these large window displays of Michael Jackson memorabilia."
MJ One,"What an amazing show at Mandalay Bay. I had a great time with, Billie Jean, Ben, Dirty Diana, and my awesome sister who got me tickets to see this show. It wasnt a Bad experience but it was definitely a Thriller night. From the opening act to the closing act is unforgettable. Each scene was creatively designed well with all performers and MJs iconic songs in a visually stunning stage presence. If you have an appreciation for Cirque style performance and love Michael Jackson songs, I highly recommend this show thats not Black or White but an awesome theatrical spectacle with good vibes.

There is one particular scene that caught me off guard in a emotional state because it felt like MJ was saying to his audience that, Ill Be There. The actual scene was a 3D holographic scene of MJ singing and dancing along with the performers. It Got me reminiscing all the good times whenever Im at a party, event, family gatherings. My siblings and I grew up with Michael Jackson music and we didnt get the chance to see him in concert. I cant speak from experience to an actual MJ concert but this show gave me a lasting impression. I will come back to this, You Rock My World and Dont Stop Till You Get Enough Show that will convince you to Remember The Time!

2017 Yelp Review #50"
MJ One,"I really enjoyed this show but it wasnt my favorite in the three Cirque du Soleil shows I saw while visiting Vegas.  I was  seated in Section 102, Row F, Seat 11.  I did read reviews where they said it was better to sit further back in order to see the aerial performers and I thought it would be okay.  Nope.  Sit further back.  I was able to see the stage just fine but there are some things going on above you that would have been easier to see if I paid more $ and sat further back.  The best part of the show (to me) was the hologram of MJ.  To see that was worth the ticket price in itself.  The robot dancers were sharp and much better dancers (to me) than the ones in white.  I also didnt get the point of the 4 main characters, Im an MJ fan but not a fan fan so perhaps a real fan understands the point of them being there."
MJ One,Absolutely amazing show!!!! This show is definitely worth the price. Every moment of the show keeps you engaged and looking to see whats next. The highlight was the holographic MJ at the end. It nearly drove me to tears as it was absolutely amazing!!!! All the seats at the venue are good however opt for middle seats versus those in the very front as you get to see more of the screen from that vantage point. When ordering tickets select view from seats as it gives a great reflection of what that seating actually looks like. Cant wait to go back and see this show again as its one of those shows that offers something different every time you see it.
MJ One,"What an amazing show. Im a big fan of cirque du soleil shows and this one was particularly amazing. If you grew up on Michael Jackson music, especially thriller and the oldies..you will LOVE this show. The music, the artists and the dance performance blew my mind away. If you are in Vegas, definitely see this show. You wont be disappointed!"
MJ One,"The show was amazing! I definitely recommend it,especially if you love Michael Jackson music. The last song at the end brought tears to my eyes. An extremely well done production! However, we made the mistake of getting front row tickets!  Not third or sixth row....but row ONE! Huge mistake! 

We were so close we can see the dancers breathing, their facial movements, the talking among other dancers and we were even part of the show in the beginning! However....by the end of the night my neck hurt tremendously!

No need to spend extra money on close seats. They had performances that would of been a much better view for me if I was further back. 

The memorabilia and seeing the socks and jackets M.J. actually wore was a very special moment for me! Go see it!!"
MJ One,"While I enjoyed the Michael Jackson One show, I do not recommend it as your first show. This newest Cirque du Soleil performance is located in the Mandalay Bay Casino with several performances every week. They have many ticket options and deals, so I recommend shopping around for the best price.

The overall concept is live action music videos based on the collected works of Michael Jackson. They use a good mix of the popular and less popular songs to create a Cirque-style show complete with paparazzi harassing audience members and a few comic interludes between lavish performances.

I prefer the classic Cirque shows with a more freeform use of music and imagery. Restricting themselves to Michael Jackson broadens the shows appeal, but lessens the overall impact of the art form. First time visitors may be more intrigued by Mystere or O to really showcase the style.

Nevertheless, Michael Jackson One still brings the house down. There were a few slow parts, but most of the acts were top notch with lots of human performances and a few unexpected surprises. The use of electronic lights and media is truly impressive for this show. Michael would be proud."
MJ One,"Well that was $208 totally down the drain. 

Theres only about 5 or 10 minutes of this show that is impressive (acrobatically). The rest is just a lot of SUPER LOUD music set to music videos shown on big screens. Unlike the Beatles LOVE show, this show is a disappointment."
MJ One,"As of tonight, I can honestly say that I have seen every Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.  This one is definitely near the top of the list. 

Perfect selection of Michael Jacksons greatest hits, presented fantastically by Cirque du Soleil. I didnt think I would love it this much. I cant wait to see it again.  

From fantastic choreography to amazing staging, and lighting effects both of the theater, as well as on the costumes themselves, I found it so hard not to sing along and feel emerged in each song performance. 

A wonderful evening.  I highly recommend this show to any MJ or Cirque fan. Not even that. Anyone who would love a good entertaining show, this is a great choice."
MJ One,"Im torn between giving this a four or five star rating. In the end, this is a four star (really four and a half) rating because Ka was on a five star level.
I actually enjoyed this WAYYYYY MORE than I thought I would. We went on a Monday, March 5th 9:30 PM show. 

Please keep in mind, this is NOT your typical Cirque Du Soleil show. This is more of a dance performance, if anything. I can see why some people might be bored but those who have any kind of dance background would be entertained and appreciate the choreography. Theres also some really neat visual effects. 

Show is about 90 minutes long with no intermission. I feel like every seat in this theater is a good one. Theres so much happening on the sides, in the aisles and above you...you dont have to have the front center seats. My favorite segments were (in no particular order): Dirty Diana, Thriller and The Way You Make Me Feel. Makes me want to take a dance class now! =)"
MJ One,The wife and I went to the Michale Jackson show. Great show. So much action going on. Lots to see. If you love Micheal Jacksons music this is the show for you. Dont miss it.
MJ One,"Honestly! Boring. Poor Michael Jackson! He never would have green-lighted this production! I dont understand all these positive reviews! How could someone say they love his music, and like this show! Michael Jackson was a legend and deserves better. Shame. So disappointed. No heart. The only good dancer was the one with one leg!"
MJ One,"Five comments. 1.  I paid to see a freakin finger puppet show to 1 whole MJ song 2.  Michael Jackson called and he wants his rhythm and beats back. Is it the fact I saw the 9:30 show or what - no one can seem to stay within the rhythm.....  3.  A unicorn puked on your costumes (well 80% of them). 4.  I literally paid to watch the damn video of Billy Jean (it would be cheaper and better watching this via YouTube). 5. Two stars: one for the amazing white guy (solo) doing his moon walk and one star for the amazing amputee guy. 

No stars for all the white millennials you had dancing to something they know crap about."
MJ One,"Sensory Overload!
The opening act was a bit of an overload, but after the first song, it all came together. The performers were incredible and all of our favorite songs were sang and performed (except for my youngest nephews fav, ABC). 
It was fun seeing the dancers dress like MJ. The shadow puppets were incredible."
MJ One,I didnt go in with high expectations but its Micheal. I was extremely disappointed and for 139$ Idk what I was expecting but to be honest I wouldnt even pay 20$ for this show. Dont waste ur time while in Vegas. On the the other hand the Zumanity show at the New York New York was half the price and was AMAZING!!! So much I wanted to see it again. Im not trying to be pessimistic but Im pretty sure Micheal would of hated it too. There was a few highlights but literally it was maybe three. Im sorry but in the words of In Live In Color Hated it!!!
MJ One,We really enjoyed the show. At times it was too loud and the electric guitar instrumental throughput the show seemed a little out of place. It seemed more like a hair band accompaniment than MJ pop. The show just keeps getting better as it goes on. Actually the best part of the dance troupe was the handicap dancer. It is wonderful to see such an amazing dancer and  the opportunity we had to see him excel.
MJ One,"This is THE best show on the strip, bar NONE. If youre a Michael Jackson fan you will not be disappointed in this show and if youre not a fan(who isnt) youll still love the show. The choreography, dance routines, 3D hologram of Michael, the dance-alike performer, and of course the flawless music. I thought the show was so well done, there was not a weak link in the chain, every sequence was a huge rush of excitement, the hair stood up on my back on almost every song. It was a perfect montage of all his songs and music videos and dance routines. I wanted to jump on the stage and moonwalk with the performers they looked like they were having so much fun. 
I dont think I blinked for the entire show! I cant wait to see this show again, this will be a must-see requirement every time Im in town."
MJ One,Amazing tribute to Michael Jackson ! Must see if your a Michael Jackson fan . You wont be disappointed.
MJ One,"Oh my goodness this was an awesome show. This was my first cirq show and I loved it. The music was fantastic. The sound and lighting was awesome. We were able to get moved closer to stage and that was cool. 
I would highly recommend seeing this show."
MJ One,"Fantastic.  Absolutely stunning performance based on the music of Michael Jackson.  By far my favorite Cirque Du Soleil Show.  Everyone I came into contact with was incredibly friendly, had lots of passion and spirit, and was helpful.  The theater is large and comfortable.  Seats had lots of padded cushioning that made the experience that much better.  If you are sensitive to loud noises I recommend reconsidering attending.  The music will blow you away and is very loud to help create that intimate, immersive experience.  Nothing ear-shattering like a bar or night club, but definitely more powerful than the sound production in an IMAX or Cinemark XD theater.

Dont blink or turn away or youll miss the action!  Each scene is well choreographed with a terrific set and backdrop.  There is so much going on that most times its impossible to catch the entire scene at once.  Look up, left and right, and behind because you get a chance to see it all.  This show even plays old clips of Michael Jackson which makes it an emotional experience for many, myself included.  There is a nice surprise in the Neverland Ranch scene that really caps the experience.

This show may not have as many body contortionist acrobats like Zumanity, doesnt have a massive pool like O, or a rotating stage like Ká, but this show is unique by providing its own entertainment value that makes it worth every penny you may spend on tickets.  Based on the action, I would presume the 100-level seats are definitely the best to get.  200-level is not on a balcony level as it would be with Ká, but it is more elevated than the stage and might make seeing the action harder.

In the picture, seat waswere Section 101, Row P, Seat 11"
MJ One,"I like this show a lot. Its not like their other shows where people are flying and swimming. There was a good story to this show. I thought the dancing was really good and the ending part was awesome. I dont want to spoil it, so I wont say. But I definitely want to see this again."
MJ One,"This was a mostly great show. When the name Cirque is attached, I have high expectations. At times, these expectations were met. At other times, not so much. There were some technical elements that fell short, and others that excelled. Billie Jean, Bad, and Thriller were awesome. The B or W finale was, IMO, not as stellar as the aforementioned numbers, and the first half not as good as the second. Also, no intermission- which was okay, but unexpected. (I guess I should have bought a program.) And the end of the show, post standing-O, dragged on awkwardly. All in all worth seeing once if youre a fan of MJ, but I wouldnt see again unless I knew it would be changed up a bit. Oh- and drinks and snacks were worse than movie theater prices, but I suppose thats to be expected. 
PROS: Quality dancers and some cool tech
CONS: Cost, consistency of quality throughout show, finale"
MJ One,"The music plus a few performers make the show.  Music (as expected) is great, plus the main performer &amp; an amputee (1 leg) steal the show.  Not many acrobatics &amp; the story is hard to follow, but worth the $120 for (back section / distant) seats.  Similar to the Beatles Love show - go if you dig the music, see another Cirque show (or Absinthe) if you dont."
MJ One,"This is my third time in Vegas and this is the best show Ive seen.

You know the songs and they are set to amazing dances and stunts! There is kind of a loose storyline to it, I didnt totally follow it but that didnt really matter. The visuals are just stunning. I dont want to give anything away--just go! Also, my husband and I both felt it was worth it to sit in/near the back, you really get the full picture that way!

The only negatives:
-this is a small complaint, but the opening number is so busy that it makes it almost hard to know where to look! Just know its just the opening act and you wont feel overwhelmed the whole time. (But look toward the top, some seriously jaw dropping athletics are happening up there!)
-I wish theyd stop letting people in 15 min before show time. People entered the row ahead of us during the opening act insisting they had seats there and causing a fuss. It took a bit annoyingly long to resolve."
MJ One,"This was my first time in Vegas and the first time seeing Cirque du Soleil, which was on my life to do list. I think that this particular show focuses more on dance than acrobatics. It is a Michael Jackson based show after all. So no surprise there. They played an array of music from Michaels childhood to his last album. The dancers are phenomenal and quite gifted. Some moves youre just born with and no amount of dance classes can teach you what these people can do naturally. Im speaking specifically of the male solo.

Like Michael in his time, there was the use of some pretty cool technology that made you wonder how it was done. Watch out for that glove!

The show I attended was not sold out and I was upgraded upon entry to lower level seats. There are no bad seats in the house, so I would buy upper levels and hope for the best. Actually, front of upper level is probably the best seat in the house.

My only disappointment is that they did not do my favorite, Remember the Times. I spent the whole show waiting for it and it was not in the lineup. Bah humbug. Outside of that, amazing performance, must see."
MJ One,"Wow! Wow wow wow!!! I have seen this show for the fourth time and it was better this time around than the last three times. There were a few subtle changes here and there, all for the better. 
This show is absolutely phenomenal. The price that you pay for your seat is completely worth it, as it is not cheap. The performers are so talented. It is clear that everybody up there loves Michael Jacksons music and loves what they do.
If you are a fan of Michael Jacksons music, like I am, you will not be disappointed in anyway, yet rather taken aback by how beautiful the show is. It honors his memory with such grace and such power, that you can not take your eyes away from it.
I will be seeing the show many more times. I still have not gotten bored of it and I still cannot wait to see it again. In my opinion, this is easily the best Cirque du Soleil show on the strip."
MJ One,"Recently went to Vegas as a celebration for my husband, and his dad treated us to the show. 

I have to say it was excellent and beyond enjoyable. The interactions with the audience were a nice touch, and the almost 360* visual display really made you feel like you were part of the show. It was very loud though, so if you are sensitive yo hearing you may want to check on it first. 

There was a good mix of old and new songs, and a great tribute piece to him. Michael was all about inclusion and as he said in his song, it doesnt matter if your black or white, you are important and worthwhile and I think the show did a good job of capturing his message and aura. 

He is indeed a musician who is greatly missed, and who left way to early."
MJ One,"I have such a greater respect for Michael Jackson after watching this show. Its an amazing tribute to him. Its a bit eerie when you walk in and to your seats but I think thats part of it lol. 

The seats are comfortable and have built in speakers to better amplify the music and experience. I dont think theres a bad seat in there! 

The performers get the audience involved and excited. They are all so talented and amazing at what they do. During they show, I have to keep reminding myself that Im watching a Cirque show because of all the acrobatics and stunts going on. There is no other way to explain the show without ruining the experience for you, but I highly highly recommend the show. Even if you arent a big Michael Jackson fan, its still a great show to see! 

P.S. use Delano valet ($15 up to four hours), its a closer walk. Unless you want to park at the Mandalay Bay parking garage which is $7/hour. The show is 90 minutes."
MJ One,Im a huge fan of Michael and I love the show. Hopefully Mandalay Bay keeps it afloat and it generates profit after this nonsense with leaving never land.
MJ One,"We are locals, and paid for great seats,  centre stage,  6 rows back.
Epic show, just beautiful!  The hologram was so touching. Loved the show. Definitely recommend going. 
We were celebrating my Wifes Birthday, what a great way to celebrate a milestone Birthday. 
Dont use your camera,  there are people trying to video and take pics,  and security is all over it with a blue laser light, so distracting,  plz dont be that person,  its just a great experience, especially if you grew up to his music. 
To the performers, you guys were frkn awesome !"
MJ One,"If you havent seen MJ One, then you need to put this on your list ASAP! This show encompasses a variety of talented performances including dancing, singing, and acrobatic stunts while all playing MJs classic hits. Each song is beautifully choreographed and fits the mood perfectly. In addition, the lighting and the special effects on each MJ song are awesome!!! Some of my favorites were Thriller, Beat it, and Billie Jean. They even showcased a video of younger MJ singing Ill be there, which I loved!! But the best one had to be Man in the mirror with the MJ Hologram. I was moved yet impressed how they incorporated him in the show. As for the seating, dont bother paying a lot of $$$ to be seated closer to the stage. My friends and I sat in Section 201 row QQ and saw everything with no problems. There were stunts on the side of the theater and acrobatics coming from the top so its better to be seated further away to get the whole experience. 

As a local, I normally dont like to see shows more than once if I have friends or family in town; however, with this show, Ill make it an exception to see it again. I definitely recommend this show. You wont regret it!!"
MJ One,"This was probably the least favorite of the shows Ive attended in Las Vegas.  The technicolor and the use of technology was amazing and the costuming was great.  However, the holigrams of Michael Jackson which were used did not truly, in my opinion, reflect the true genius of his impact he had on our society.  The story line was not readily understood and following it was difficult.  At the end it became a little clearer, however, by that time people had begun to leave the auditorium.  So, for the above reasons I am giving this a four star rating.  I do not think I would want to see it again."
MJ One,"The show was REALLY very good. Lost count of how many songs. They dancers and performers were outstanding. The Thriller and Billy Jean performances were my favorite. 
The whole story from start to finish was done very well. And the performance with Michael Jacksons own video footage incorporated with the performers was really very touching and well done 
I had the opportunity to sit in the 4th row and it was just great with people overhead and the acrobatics. Great performance!!"
MJ One,"This show was absolutely spectacular and worth every penny we spent on the tickets! The artistry, skill, precision and talent that each performer brought to the stage was phenomenal. Highly recommend you see this show if you are in Vegas!"
MJ One,"I enjoyed this show a lot for its entertainment value. It was powerful at times with the mix of music, lights, technical talent and extremely talented performers . I wasnt really there as a huge Michael Jackson fan, although I always enjoyed his music. However I was here on a girls weekend with some huge MJ fans. They were is awe of the entire show as cirque newbies !! No criticism from me as our goal and purpose for going to the show was to enjoy ourselves and be entertained. We were not disappointed!  Several times throughout the evening I found myself thinking ahead to when I can get my husband out here so we could go together since I knew he would enjoy it. So that tells me I had a great time!"
MJ One,"Ive been going to Cirque du Soleil shows since Quidam, which still is my favorite Cirque du soleil show.  This was a really close 2nd.  The visuals are amazing, and the sound was perfect.  It made me want to dance like MJ after the show."
MJ One,"Sorry folks.  This is where I would say if you like Michael Jackson music you will like the show but in this case it might be the only part of the show you like.  
Ok, so that is an overstatement.  The truth is that there are 4-5 really good parts of the show like you would expect from a Cirque production but overall this was the worst Cirque show I have ever seen.  Honestly I would say about 50% if it is not very good.  I cant imagine if you have seen other Cirque shows and you are not a huge fan of MJ that you would like it.  If you dont have a lot to references from other Cirque shows and you love MJ then you will probably love it. 
Similar to other shows, this one tries to tell a story about some regular people that enter the surreal Cirque world.  This time there are 2 guys and 2 girls that play that part.  Basically most of the time that they are on stage the show is bad (they are on stage a lot).  They dont speak so they have to act to communicate the story they are telling and their acting is BAD.  The one legged dancer is showcased a lot along with a troupe of other dancers dressed in white outfits.  They are talented but they are too much and too often on stage.  There are some ridiculous characters in black with some sort of contraption on their head along with electronic red banners across their chest.  I guess they are supposed to represent the paparazzi??  Either way they are part of the problem with the shows mediocre story.  I dont know what the hell the lady that comes in and out from the ceiling is supposed to be.  Why does she sing at all when the rest of the music and recorded singing is so loud you cant hear her anyway?  I know she is supposed to be part of the story but I asked around and no one I talked to could figure out her purpose.  

I listened to a lot more Michael Jackson than Beatles in my lifetime but the Beatles LOVE is a way better show.  I have recommended LOVE to many people since I saw it.  I would not recommend MJ ONE to anyone."
MJ One,"The BOMB show!!
The One only King of Pop! Even after his passing his show still sells out. This was amazing and at the same time a great tribute to MJ. Was nice to see he was hologramed into the presentation. 
Loved every moment as it had me dancing along to the music!! 2 thumbs UP!! If I had more thumbs it be ul too...lol!"
MJ One,"Excellent entertainment, you will cry it is so moving, touching and absolutely the best ever!!"
MJ One,"This show was beyond awesome ! Unfortunately, I cant give it a 5 star because they didnt include the song remember the time... in my opinion it missing this . Remember the time is such a big hit and even today its still played all over the world. Other than that it was perfect !"
MJ One,"I dont even know where to begin .

I was hesitant about spending over $100 for s ticket for show but everyone said that its a MUST SEE

We arrived at Mandalay Bay a little early for the show .. we were greeted at the Venue by a ticket taker (all dressed in Michael Jackson themed clothing ) and strode in line to get a drink .

The drink line ran a bit slow and $20 for a drink in a commemorative cup wasnt on my list .. but hey .. its Vegas .

This cirque du soleil show blew my mind ... so many things going on : on stage , up the walls, dropping from the ceiling and coming up through the floor ! 

There was a music and magic and it even snowed inside the theatre !  I laughed , smiled and realized that MJ was so ahead of his time ... his words and music throughout the night reminding us to be kind ,to love one another and to know that we are all ONE ."
MJ One,"Great show! Our first and only show we saw. The music and costumes were great. Obviously, it was all MJ songs and they did acrobats and dancing to them. The theme was a little silly but overall, the performances were top notch. Everything else was expensive- drinks, shirts, ect. They also took your picture and wanted you to buy at the end, which was $30-100. But those were all extras and didnt have to buy. Id see the show again. It didnt seem like there was a bad seat in the theater as well. They used the walls, isles, and came down from the ceiling."
MJ One,"Was not my fave show for the Cirque folks. Have seen three others. The hologram was special, as were the shadow and neon light people. Otherwise, a lot of dancing wrapped by a frenetic back story that never made sense."
MJ One,"Show is really amazing, good music and ambience. We seated in the middle of last row and we didnt had problems with view. Tickets cost us $360,which is a lot for MJ, because start price was $75 but we book in advance(1 month) and everything was sold out, we couldnt find less than $125 per person.So I suggest book it in very much in advance.

Show was interrupted in the middle but they continued in 10min.

Cartography was excellent but there were some parts which was just OKEY.
Ending was vey good and colorful. Even tough all tickets were sold out there were plenty of empty seats."
MJ One,"Best show ever!!!! Michael Jackson One , I will see EVERY time I happen to find myself in Vegas. Amazing from start to finish.  Do not get the cheap seats! Treat yourself , worth every penny. Only wish the selection of music was a little more traditional Michael... There was a few songs I have never heard, still cannot take away five stars.  Seriously entertaining. Keep your eyes looking everywhere or you may miss something."
MJ One,"My first cassette tape was MJs Bad so this show brought back a lot of good memories. We sat in the lower level, row M towards to side and the seat view were great! I definitely liked this more than KA.

1.5 hours with no break and the time went by fast. The choreography was beautiful and I just wanted the show to keep going. If you are thinking about going to this show, I would just do it! 

We arrived about 5 minutes before show time, which worked out well because we were able to take a few pictures outside the show. After the show, it was a zoo of people."
MJ One,"Very Disappointed. 
I have seen several Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas and this ONE was by far my least favorite of all. It lacked the quality you usually get with Cirque shows but the ticket prices were still up there! I didnt feel like the acrobats were very good with the exception of the pole dancer, she was fantastic, but a very small part of the show. Lots of synchronized dancing to MJ music that was not very synchronized. Lots of dancers on harnesses and zip lines but again, not a lot of quality acrobats or specialized talent. 

I love Michael Jacksons music and was really looking forward this show. I would have rather just watched his videos on the big screen vs this show."
MJ One,"Very, very good!

If you will see the show I suggest you not read descriptive reviews or watch videos.  In my opinion its best to go with an open mind, ready to embrace and live in the moment.  To that end, I aint gonna tell ya nuttin about the show.  Since I always want my money to work overtime, I want you to get great ticket prices!

Sign up for an MLife account.  MLife is the website for (all) MGM properties/hotels and shows they host in Vegas.  You can book a room at any MGM hotel (they say at the lowest prices) and from my experience, they also have the lowest tickets.

I found out accidentally that prices vary wildly throughout the day.  I was planning a birthday weekend trip for my husband and adding this show meant less money to gamble...uh...No!  Thinking wed have to see a different show, I went back to MLife and found the tickets lower than the first time.  Then I was intrigued.  It became a game.  Back and forth over a several days and jackpot!  Great seats with our gambling budget intact.

Also, dont be afraid of the isles - words given me by an MLife rep.  In all my shopping, I jammed up my account holding tickets while looking for the next best deal.  I had to call to buy.

Have fun!  Youre gonna love it!!"
MJ One,"Loved. Loved. Loved!!!!
Michael Jackson was ahead of his time with his music. Cirque du Soleil did a fanatic job of portraying his message in a classy way through his music. I highly recommend this show out of all the shows on the strip! Seating throughout the theater is great. We were in the second to last row and still had a great view."
MJ One,"The show was a cool tribute; acrobatics, dance, and visuals were impressive.  However, some acts were fillers and the storyline was weird.  Also, seating matters.  A lot going on the stage, the sides, and over the audience.  I dont recommend sitting in the front, far left side.  I was constantly moving my head in all directions hoping I wasnt missing anything important."
MJ One,"Ive seen a few Cirque shows, and this one had the least acrobatics of all of them.  But...if you are an MJ fan, this is an absolute must. I cant describe how amazing this was, and the performers are so dang talented. 

The Billie Jean and Thriller numbers were my favorite, but there wasnt a bad one. Just Wow. Go see it. Youll find yourself listening to MJ for the next week. And youll then realize that there will never, EVER be another Michael Jackson. 

Hes the greatest entertainer of all time, and these performers do every bit of justice to that claim."
MJ One,For us after this show only the Beatles is missing to watch so I can say that from all cirque du Soleil this one was nice i feel like the girls in the beginning are family members of the management and I wish this show has all the Michael Jacksons Street performers artists. I love to see them dancing and their acts are very entertaining.  The song are good some we didnt know and Michael has such a big list of hits that they could use all the ones everybody knew. I recommend this show even dough feels a little too long. The lights on their clothes and the guy at rope was unbelievable good. So try to get a good deal and enjoy the show.
MJ One,"So incredibly good! This was, by far, my favorite Cirque show, second to Beatles Love. Im always amazed by what the performers are able to do with their bodies and that set to Michael Jacksons music was just amazing. Theyve created a cant miss experience for any MJ fan from the moment you walk into the lobby and throughout the show. Although the theme of the show was not quite what I expected- there was an strong emphasis on how the media hounded Michael throughout his life. Interesting, but I anticipated more focus on the music and maybe an interpretation of it. Regardless, my family and I enjoyed it immensely. I should add that we were seated all the way in the back and still had a great view of the show. There dont seem to be any bad seats in the theater."
MJ One,"One of the best shows Ive ever seen! Holy cow, the dancing so high energy and the music awesome (MJ so...), great colorful costumes and comfy seats! My gripe is the $8 soda was a little expensive for the size. The people in front of me also didnt sit back all the way so hard to see some parts of show. Overall loved it as it was feel good and awesome with a cool hologram of MJ. Great for fans; his costumes on display on site too! Best Cirque show Ive seen yet and Id see it again in a minute! Awesome and fun! A plus!!!!!!"
MJ One,"This was Hands down the best show I have ever seen in my life! I can not endorse something more than this. We got tickets to the 9:00 pm show at the Mandalay Bay and didnt stop being impressed for the entire time. 3D holograms on the stage, awesome feats of strength and acrobatics, and great dancing...Not too mention all of the great music from Michael Jacksons long career.
The show was extremely interactive especially during the Thriller act, but I will not ruin it for you here! If you get a chance to see one show while in Vegas you will not be disappointed by this one. If you are a child of the 80s (or just a Michael Jackson fan) then this is a must on the bucket list of shows for you."
MJ One,"I grew up listening to Michael Jackson and have enjoyed many Cirque shows in Vegas and elsewhere, so One shouldve been right up my alley.  While I enjoyed the show, I definitely felt it was lacking and not nearly as good other Cirque shows or the Cirque-like Le Reve (at the Wynn).  

The staging and projections were well done and theres not really a bad seat in the whole theater.  The storyline - a handful of kids who obtain different pieces of MJs clothing and then gaining confidence and power - is pretty weak.  Worse yet is that there was very little of the usual Cirque acrobatics.  While I was happy to see both the leads and background actors dancing at times it seemed more like watching a Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation concert than a Cirque show.  There just wasnt enough of the jumping, gymnastics-style stunts youre used to seeing with Cirque.  
Moreover, the balance of the song-selection was way off.  There was just too much time spent on some of MJs lesser known (or lesser loved) music, and not enough time spent on his best work.  Some classics like Rock With You, the Girl is Mine, and P.Y.T. just werent even played."
MJ One,"What a fantastic show! Ive seen the other ones and must admit no other Cirque show ive seen ends with a standing ovation from the audience. If you knew Michaels life and heard his music youll really enjoy the show. 

Oddly enough theres a story in the show and involves 4 kids finding Michaels artifacts- hats, gloves, shoes. I didnt know any of this before seeing the show and i still loved it. 

Its more of a Michael Jackson concert with a bit of Cirque thrown in. I enjoyed the balance of not over doing it on one end or the other. The acrobatics, dancing, production, visual effects and skill level was a sight i havent seen in other Cirque shows. Not to take away from the other ones but this one is a bit more relatable considering most of us know his music.  

When it ended i was surprised and caught off guard. Most Cirque shows start to drag and you dont know if its ending or winding up for a second act but this one had us on the edge of our seats and then before i knew it it was over."
MJ One,"This show was much more than I expected, and it was my first time seeing a Cirque du Soleil show. I loved the music selections, and the dancers are of course incredibly talented.  It was so much fun to see the costume changes throughout the show to match what Michael Jackson would have worn in the music video. I felt like the show was a tribute to and a mirror of his life, with a mixture of upbeat pop hits and melancholy slow songs.  Beautifully done.  

For me the highlights were the insane feats on the trampoline during Thriller, and the costumes during Billie Jean.  I wont give any more away - go see it for yourself!"
MJ One,"This is a must go to show if youre going to be in Vegas
But there is not a lot of shortcuts for his discounts for the shows I was able to check Mandalay Bay website and get some tickets for a $95 each during our time in Las Vegas and that is the cheapest I saw I think they can get into the $200 range but luckily we only paid the $95
This is my second show the first one was KA at the MGM but I must say this one was my favorite I am a Michael Jackson lover so maybe that makes me biased but I love the overall production I like the graphics and the different phases of Michaels life they went through the Holograms a lot of intertwining of his videos even the stuff I cant even explain like the people on the walls that jumped out unexpectedly it was like you didnt know which way to turn which way to look it was something always happening around you which was fun and exciting another thing this place gets a little chilly so bring a sweater but its a great night you know a Las Vegas youre there to really spend money for your entertainment and not have any regrets so definitely go and have fun"
MJ One,"I have been to a lot of shows and concerts but I have never seen a show like this. It was AMAZING. I debated going due to the price but it was 90 min of WOW. From the lights and the costumes the stunts and of course the music and memories of Michael it is something you have to see because it cant really be put into words at all
If your near or in Vegas it is worth the price. You definitely get what you pay for plus a whole lot more. Michael would be proud"
MJ One,Michael Jackson One is absolutely amazing. An emotional rollercoaster from excitement to tears.
MJ One,"Went to 2 shows in Vegas and this one was amazing! If you like MJs dance moves or music this is for you! They had great dance moves and incorporated all of the big hits. They also had a slight storyline that was easy to follow. The dancing was so varied and mesmorizing. From using trampolines to dancing poles to ropes they use every type of prop to take dance to the next level. 
Really liked this show too because it wasnt overwhelming. Some shows i find its hard to know what to focus on and then you miss something major while looking the other way, this one was not like that. They focus the light on the big dance scenes and dont have too much extraneous moves that youre attention is being pulled in a different direction. 

Highly recommended this show to anyone, MJ lover or appreciator of dance, however the MJ component is great!"
MJ One,"This show was honestly and disappointingly JUST OK.

I love Michael Jackson and his music and I was expecting to be blown away by absolutely every aspect of his show. Honestly anything less is not really worthy of Michael Jackson and this show tried, but it missed the mark.

We had great seats in the center of the third row from the stage so we were able to see absolutely everything. If you dont get seats right up front youll be fine, but sitting in the back will leave you squinting because theres a lot going on and its not your typical Cirque show where it involves the whole audience, or everything is happening around you; everything happens in the front.

The show started out great with the guitarist and the lights and the dancers and it got me really excited for the rest of the show, but honestly after that initial performance the good songs and performances were few and far between. 

It became quickly apparent that the guitarist was out of place aside from the first song and MAYBE one other and they were kind of just throwing her in there every once in a while to justify paying her.

The female dancers out shined the male dancers by far and were the best part of the show. They seemed to actually want to be there whereas the male dancers just phoned it in. A lot of the dancing was repetitive and wasnt as on point as you would expect from a dancer at an actual Michael Jackson show. There was also a pole dancer in there who was awesome and is definitely not being paid enough.

The theme of the show had a MAJOR disconnect from the storyline that was going on with the kids that ran around throughout the show. They were really grasping at straws on this one. Also it was a major let down because each one of them gets an MJ item and is able to dance like him more or less after they acquire it and as an audience member youre expecting the last guy to do the best MJ impression because hes been trying the longest to get the glove and he gets it and does nothing. Seriously??? Also, is it just me or is it super stereotypical that the Asian girl doesnt really do any MJ moves but does some half ass karate to Jam?

All of the slow songs honestly could have been skipped except for the last one. They were unrecognizable to people who arent true MJ fans (I went with my bf and he had no idea they existed before the show) and they either had only one person dancing (2 of them) in an OK fashion, doing the whole performance on a rope because they have to throw something in to justify the Cirque label, or theres really nothing much going on. Literally two performers just sat on the stage while one person danced through one of the songs (kinda really boring). The only reason I said they could leave in the last song was because they had a hologram of Michael dancing which was honestly the best performance of the whole show and they couldve have made the whole thing that way and I would have been more entertained."
MJ One,"Got goose bumps just going to a MJ show.  Been to several Cirque shows and loved them all! 
The MJ combined the greatest music with the greatest visual entertainment to produce a never to be forgotten experience.

The price is a little steep and there are other MJ shows out there, but totally worth it.

I was on the edge of my seat the entire show.  It was just unreal how many people from all over the world came to together to see and sing along to this MJ show!"
MJ One,"I read some of the constructive feedback below from people rating this show less than 5 stars and honestly, they 100% have valid points and while I agree with a lot of what they say, I STILL LOVED THE SHOW. Ive seen La Reve and all the other Cirque du Soleil (CDS) shows in town as well as the smaller (CDS-like) ones like WOW! and Inferno. Yes, this show doesnt have as much of the CDS stuff but it has more than enough to satisfy a CDS vet PLUS the amazing, amazing (mostly MJ style) dancing! I had tears in my eyes watching the main male soloist dancer. Perfection, truly. No entertainer has moved me like that since MJ himself. Im from the Thriller generation and was IN LOVE with MJ growing up, so it was more important to me to have an MJ experience rather than more of an O or Mystere experience. For me, the selling point of this show is MJ, less so CDS, but this is just me.

I do think the storyline of the 4 characters was weak as others have said, but its kind of classic CDS to have that type of thread throughout their show. I think this show could do away with that storyline.

My husband and I plan to go again at some point. We sat front row on the floor and while its great feeling the energy and seeing the performers super close, wed like to sit farther back next time. 

This is as close as we can get to live MJ and is a must see for MJ super fans like me."
MJ One,"Well, I actually quite enjoyed this. I really didnt know what to expect. 

Ill try not to spoil too much, but you can rest safe knowing that they cover as many michael Jackson favorites as you can fit into a 80min show. 

There are lots of things happening all over the place that its sometimes hard to keep track. People climbing on the walls, people flying from the ceiling, etc. 

They also tell kind of an interesting story with 4 kids who get trapped in michael jacksons world, which revolves around famous pieces of his clothing (for example the glove). 

The best way I can sum it up is think about all the cool dance acts on Americas Got Talent the past few years and imagine if they incorporated a bunch of those top dance and acrobatic acts into a giant cirque de soleil. Thats what Michael Jackson One is.  The fact that I like Americas Got Talent explains why Im rating this 5 star."
MJ One,"I loved this show.

And a big thank you to the producers of this show for not having a Michael Jackson look alike."
MJ One,"First- THANK you to the Usher who saw I was so short in 101 s 1 because I couldnt see the actual stage due to the seat in front of me. 52 dont select this seat!!!!!!! She moved me to a prime spot in the middle of the theater wow me!

Now to my extreme underwhelmed experience.

MJ fan, grew up in the era, not new, know all the songs and who doesnt know the Thriller routine yes!  I was less than thrilled with the choreography for the females. There are good parts but not enough. Some typical dance moves were barely executed, wondered if some were prepped for the night or tired.  Id like to see more focus on the moves from MJ and not moves of today.  Glad I went, check mark on this event.

The audience was lackluster honey!!! They sat stiff in chairs, I was laughing while grooving my ass, clapping, finger snapping... its a show non POC move yourselves!!!"
MJ One,"We couldnt get tickets to Celine so the next best thing seemed to be catching a Cirque show, especially since Id never seen one. None of the themes of the shows had ever really grabbed me but when I saw they had a Michael Jackson theme I knew I had to see it.

Warning! Do not drink before the show! Im sure thats common sense for most shows but I missed a small section of the show because I had to run to the bathroom. Lame, I know.

Anyway, I loved the little details of this show and the interactive elements. Even the doors to the show are Michael Jackson themed. When you walked in there are red coated paparazzi flashing pictures of you. I thought it was fake but they actually take your picture and post it on fake tabloids that appear inside the theater before the show. 

Our seats were in section 102 which were three rows from the back of the first section. I liked that you could see everything clearly but were also far back enough to take it all in. The show is high energy the whole time and all the classic songs are incorporated. I liked that it was a blend of cirque acts as well as dancing and some of the moves were very impressive.

There is a lot of crowd interaction. We had a dancer come dance in our row, people whizzing by from the ceiling, and the main characters were sitting in front of us at the beginning of the show and we didnt even know it. I actually gave them a dirty look because they were climbing the seats but it was actually part of the show! That was cool. I wish I could see it again to be able to enjoy it more instead of regreting the two glasses of champagne Id had before. Id say our bartender was right though, this is one of the hottest shows in Vegas. Must see!"
MJ One,"Fabulous show! Wife is a big Michael
Jackson fan. No bad seats. Excellent special effects and acrobatics. Highly recommend!"
MJ One,"The show was entertaining however I didnt understand who the main characters were (it was done like a play with a handful of characters who moved from one act to another using MJs music as the themes).  I want to give it less stars because my seats which I paid a lot of money for were absolute crap. Back row in the bottom section. We were the same level as the seats directly in front of us. I took an eye level pic so you know. Also pic of before the show. Do not buy section 201, row R 18, 17. Absolutely the worse seats possible."
MJ One,"I really enjoyed this show. I recommend it for MJ fans. Costumes good and performers/dancing was great. Not a typical Cirque show, but interesting."
MJ One,"If youre a Michael Jackson fan, youll enjoy it. Its a fun medley of songs - from the Jackson 5 days, to his later songs. The aerial acrobatics and choreography are enjoyable. 

Be forewarned, it is LOUD, though. I had read other reviews complaining about the volume, but had brushed the comments off, figuring perhaps it was an old fuddy-duddy complaining. No, the comments are legitimate. It is unnecessarily loud, to the point where it is almost becomes hard to actually understand the music - all you hear is loud. Whenever a softer song, like Man in the Mirror, came on it was a welcome respite. The volume seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the show."
MJ One,One of the best Cirque shows Ive ever seen. This was beyond entertaining from start to finish.  I highly recommend everyone that enjoys good music and entertainment to go see this show the next time they are in Vegas. Five stars for sure!
MJ One,"If you love listening to Michael Jackson songs, you are going to LOVE THIS SHOW!!!  Very creative use of all his songs. The dancers are performing amazing tricks left and right. MJ even makes a cool appearance in a 3D dancing hologram. It looks just like him!"
MJ One,"This is a Cirque show with a Michael Jackson theme. Dont expect an impersonator. That show is at the Stratosphere.  Cirque pays a wonderful tribute to this phenomenal artist.  The staff have the best uniforms. Some in Smooth Criminal trench coats and Fedoras others in military style clothing he wore. 
     The walls are covered with titles to his songs. His music is playing when you enter the theatre. Across from the main Lobby concession stand on the staircase is his Smooth Criminal pinstripe suit and Fedora he wore in the video. It is poised in the 45 degree angle of his famous dance move lean. Its on loan from his estate. Awesomeness!
     The show is worth seeing. The performers are magnificent athletes. The Cirque creators are exceptionally talented. Some highlights are people perform in the air from the ceiling, a visually entertaining shadow dance number and a heart warming hologram performance tastefully done. I would watch this again just to experience the halogram number again. The halogram solidified his spirit is still with us and hes still performing every night. Just get to Vegas to see it.  The video production was so creative.  Wonderful Vegas experience overall. Glad I saw it and you should too. He still inspires and electrfies audiences. No artist today is on his level. Go see this show and bring a jacket. The theatre is chilly. Cheers!"
MJ One,"Saw this a few months back but since I am here in vegas and reviewing other shows I saw this weekend I figured I would do this one as well. This was the first Vegas show I had ever seen and it was fabulous. From the music, dancing, acrobatics and effects, this show has it all. Even if you are not a Micheal Jackson fan,. I would recommend this show to you. The people in these shows are true athletes. I have now saw 5 Vegas shows and this is my second favorite out of them. So go see it, you wont be disappointed."
MJ One,"Our Zappos All Hands meeting was hosted at the Mandalay Bay at the CDS Michael Jackson One theater.

We had all our Zapponians under one roof and had a business meeting with our inspirational leader &amp; CEO.

The meeting went very well and we had fun, and then upon return of our little intermission break, we received a huge surprise by a performance from Cirque Du Soleil and their Michael Jackson tribute called ONE.

If youre a true fan of Michael Jackson or just love good entertainment, this is definitely a recommendation from me to go watch this show!

The costumes are amazing and in true Cirque Du Soleil style, the acrobatic choreography is mesmerizing and captivating!

And lets not forget the music. The legendary music of M.J. Is remixed to match the expressive mood of each selection of songs.

Theres even a special moment where Michael joins the amazing dance group.

High energy and some sweet solemn moments will having you smiling or crying...

Note: ...have tissue on hand...

If youre visiting Las Vegas or if youre a local, treat yourself. I pretty positive youll have a memorable experience.

:)"
MJ One,"Amazing experience! There are Michael Jackson themed cocktails in the bar to keep you amped during the show--- not that you would need it though! The show itself is spectacular! Before the show even begins, there are paparazzi walking around to get you hyped up for whats to come. They are very convincing! 

The show follows an interesting story... definitely not what I was expecting. The dancing is on point! The music is phenomenal! Stranger in Moscow was breathtaking! Overall, I prefer Beatles Love just a little bit more, but One is worth seeing! 

Note: Save yourself the embarrassment and DO NOT attempt to take pictures during the show. I saw several people get reprimanded for trying to sneak pictures."
MJ One,"It was awesome to see this show on Michael Jacksons birthday (August 29), thanks to one of my favorite Yelpers, Bethany E! Running into Chris V and Heather N was a nice perk, too. The crowd was infectiously excited, and there were some truly diehard fans in the audience.

As others have said, this is a bit different from other Cirque shows, with less acrobatics and more emphasis on dance. Its still quite enjoyable, and I found my favorite parts to be the Billie Jean and Thriller segments. I was surprised by the number of lesser-known songs used in the show. I have to admit that a few of the numbers were a bit too out-there for me, but the performers are clearly very talented- the Moon Lady and Guitar Chick being some of my favorites.

Overall, I cant say this is my favorite Cirque show- I preferred the Beatles LOVE despite feeling that Im a bigger MJ fan. Good sound quality, comfortable seats. Thanks again for the tickets, YelpLV!"
MJ One,"Wow.

The awesome music of Michael Jackson is put to really good use and combined with some breathtaking stunts. You really dont know where to look at times with a myriad of different things happening on the stage, in the air and behind you, all at the same time.

We were in the 3rd row, which gave a great perspective, but perhaps sitting a little further back would have provided a better overall view of the whole spectacle. All the seats seem to be positioned perfectly so that taller people in front dont block your view.

Definitely a must-see, whether you like shows or not."
MJ One,"THIS NEEDS TO BE ON YOUR LIST OF THINGS TO DO IN VEGAS.

I have spent many, many days in Vegas, at the pools, at the clubs, etc.  All of that is fun.  I fucking LOVE Vegas.  A little less not that I am not in my early 20s but I still love that place.  

The Michael Jacksone ONE Show was seriously awesome.  We searched out tickets at the ticket booth on our first day, but didnt get around to buying them til the day of.  This was a Sunday.  We bought the 9:30pm tickets, and even though we were prepared to buy more expensive tickets from our first chat with another tickets sales person, when we actually bought, the gals thoroughly explained what the venue is like, and really, there is not a bad seat in the place.  So we bought the cheap seats.  Section 205, Row PP, Seats 1 and 2.  Along the aisle to the center.  2nd row from the very back.

And then like a PYT and a Smooth Criminal, we moved up to the 2nd row from the Front of the back section, which is actually better seats than further down as you can see more of the stage and really see all the crazy sets and multiple dancers and all that.  

We didnt just do our own thing.  Actually one of the ushers came over and asked us if we wanted to move up closer, of course we said yes, so we moved to where we were taken, which ended up being about mid-theater.  

The tickets were like $80 each or so.  The show was amazing.  The dancing and all the music was seriously so cool, we loved it and would even go again, next time!  I highly, highly recommend this show!  I took some pics on the downlow (no flash!).  Seriously, go see it!"
MJ One,"Having seen O the night before, I think our expectations were set pretty high and we were slightly disappointed in the show, and even more so the staff.

The show was good, but it was primarily dancing and not much in the way of the acts Cirque has been known for. The story was creative and the dancers were hugely talented, but it felt like the show rested on the popularity of Jacksons music, rather than developing a show around the music that demonstrated what audiences come to expect from Cirque.

What was really disappointing was the staff at the theater, particularly the usher in our section. Someone gave her permission to be in charge and she ran with it! Throughout the show she was yelling and shining her light at people she thought has their cellphones out (which only one did). This was hugely disruptive to the rest of us. Then, she went and got a security officer to tell two young girls in front of us they had to sit back in their seats and stop clapping and dancing. Mind you, they were dancing IN THEIR SEATS. 

It made for a very disappointing and distracting experience, and at 120 a ticket, I was livid. I understand wanting to stop flash photography, but the bottom line is people will take pictures/video no matter what you do and it isnt fair to ruin patrons experience trying to police the heck out of everyone."
MJ One,"I have been to a few Cirque de Soleil performances and they vary dramatically. I was pretty disappointed in this one. I was not a huge MJ fan in the day, but he had a fabulous voice and great material. I was hoping the production would build on this foundation. However, all we got was recordings from Michael, very good recordings, but recordings nonetheless. I had to use musicians earplugs to mute the huge bass. Very good sound but ear shatteringly loud
If you really like the circus acts from the Cirques, this would suit you well. I just dont want to watch the aerial acrobatics for an hour and a half. 
I have seen better tributes to MJ elsewhere."
MJ One,The show started out slow &amp; story line hard to follow. First act did not seem impressive but by the third act...the show had won me over. Played all of MJs hits.  I was touched by MJs hologram performance to Man in the Mirror. Definitely anyone visiting Vegas needs to see this show
MJ One,Wow... total waste. Save your money. No idea why people love this show so much. Was referred by many people and now Im wondering if they even saw the same show. From someone who absolutely loves Michael Jackson this was a waste of time and money. Spent about $400 on tickets and walked out half way through. The show was all over the place. Couldnt even concentrate. Sensory overload not in a good way. Would not recommend this to anyone.
MJ One,"Super entertaining. Its great if you like music and dancing. Lots of talented and fantastic performers. 

Its a show that I would watch again."
MJ One,"The how was definitely fun and I would recommend going if youre an MJ fan but I didnt walk away blown away and felt it was overpriced for what you got.

There were a few extremely strong performances that made it worth it: Smooth Criminal, Billy Jean, Thriller, Black &amp; White- but the rest was very meh. 

There was a bizarre storyline that didnt make sense and was clearly just filler so they could transition the stage and backdrop. IF the story they were trying to convey (and I say IF Im caps because Im unsure) then I expected a huge number by the kids where they harnessed the power of MJ. That never happened so we all walked away confused. 

Ive been to a few other cirque performances and thought that this one was the weakest in terms of acrobatics. Again, a few very cool performances but nothing that was mind blowing."
MJ One,Amazing! I went by myself as there were not 2 good seats close to the middle. So I left my husband to gamble while I enjoyed the show. It was amazing! I had always wanted to see it but ticket prices were $$$ when it first opened. The pre-show was unexpected and I wasnt sure if it was staged or real at first (no spoilers). At one point during the Thriller performance I was a little scared. They were so realistic. I am not a big MJ Dan but I am a fan of 80s music and I definitely enjoyed this show!
MJ One,"This show is located at the Mandalay Hotel.

I cant completely say I wasnt happy with this show.  It has its own highlights.  I agree with some of the reviews about the program being all over the place here and there, and one too many acrobats on the floor. I wasnt impressed with their costumes.  Some numbers didnt really make sense and sort of out of the theme.  On the flip side of the show, I have to say that there were a few numbers I really enjoyed such as:  the very petite girl who did the solo pole number.  She was excellent and really captured the audiences attention.  She was fluid.  She had a beautiful set-up, all in red outfit and glitter.  It was very entertaining.  Another, is the glow-in-the-dark dancers dancing to Billie Jean. Another, is the solo dancer-- all in black glitter outfit who did really nice. He was also very graceful and fluid.  
Alas, It wouldve have been more enjoyable and substantial if they didnt wait too long or showed more of the 3d hologram of Michael dancing with the dancers which, came towards the end.  By that time, some people had already walked out.  Since I paid quite a bit for this show, I felt the need to go all the way.  
If you want to see this show, check for best prices and any seat is good just dont get other than the main floor where the stage is.
Once is fair enough to see this show.  Again, this is my own opinion and being a huge fan of Michael,  I had to see what this is all about. 
The best part indeed is the 3d hologram.  Michael was present.
."
MJ One,"I dont think Ill have enough words to rate this adequately, because it was just that wonderful of an experience. There is no bad seat in the house, although I will echo what some folks have said about sitting near the rows.

Like many, I have seen at least ten of the Cirque shows, and this has to be one of my favorites, along with La Nouba in Orlando. The dancing, the music, the lights, and just the energy you got from the performers... Nothing like it. We left there on a high, one that couldnt dissipate even after we paid $55.00 for two drinks at the bar (welcome to Vegas, babe). Would definitely recommend this show to all Jackson lovers and even folks whove never heard of his music (we call them aliens).

There is something for everyone here. My favorite part was seeing a mom in the row behind us with her three children (who were all sleeping) while she danced and sang along in her seat to every song. That hologram aint half bad either (just kidding, it was amazing). Dont think about it twice. JUST GO!"
MJ One,"Every Cirque du Soleil ive seen has been fantastic, so naturally I expected the same for Michael Jackson One.  As expected, the show was great!  The story-line was fun and entertaining with many wow moments.  The hardest thing for me is where you sit which is why I gave this a 4.  We had amazing seats in the 3rd row (now, dont get me wrong), but for a show like this, it was much to close.  I would love to see this show again sitting further back so I can see everything at once.  It was especially hard to see the acrobatics being performed above us.  All in all, a fantastic show for any Michael or Cirque fan."
MJ One,This was by far the best Cirque du Soleil show I have seen. It was so cool to be there on his birthday. The cast was so talented.  I loved seeing all the acrobatics it truly was magical especially during the song which i dont remember off hand but they had an image of Michael appear and disappear as if he was really there. Highly recommend.
MJ One,"If you like Michael Jackson songs, you cant go wrong with this show. You get an hour-and-a-half of non-stop Michael Jackson hits paired with dancing and acrobatics as only Cirque du Soleil can do. 

Its a small theater and stage as compared to The Beatles LOVE show, so I was wondering how they could possibly do the same level of acrobatics. Its true: They do mix more dancing in this show, but I still wasnt disappointed. It was a visual feast for the eyes with songs that brought me back to my high school and college days.

My favorite parts: The lady who performed to Dirty Diana and the act (I forget the song) where their suits lit up on stage and acrobats did the moon walk down the walls on both sides of the theater. Oh, and the song where they integrated a hologram of MJ himself. Very cool!

ALL seats have great views. We were row 4 or 5 and I was on the aisle. Acrobats literally lowered down from the ceiling above me. If anything, Id recommend sitting in row 10 or further back to get an all-encompassing view."
MJ One,Very good show. Recommend it to anyone who is looking to kill some time and watch a show l.
MJ One,"Such an amazing tribe to MJ! Loooooved the creative energy that went into this. Not only did they have my favorite numbers, but there was a lot of variety in showcasing the songs!!!!! Highly recommend"
MJ One,The best show on the strip. A must see for any MJ fan. Not very much Cirque acts. But I wasnt there for that!
MJ One,This was an amazing show! I have no words. Ive been wanting to see it for quite some time and it did not disappoint!!! Best Cirque du Soleil show EVER!
MJ One,"I thought the show was very entertaining. Combine the genius of Micheal Jacksons music and the artistry of cirque and you would expect greatness. Having said that, there were parts of the show that I absolutely loved while a few were just okay. The show featured amazingly talented dancers and performers. The choreography and acrobats stunts were creative and captivating. I definitely recommend this show, and especially if youre a fan of MJ"
MJ One,The single best show Ive ever seen! If I could give 10 stars I would. Not a bad seat in the house. Worth every penny!
MJ One,"Safe your money. This show from cirque du soleil is not worthy. 

The show stopped 3 times due to technical difficulties. Its too expensive and the actual show is not amazing. I felt as if I was watching a 3 d documentary of Michael Jackson. 
Go to legends and safe your money."
MJ One,"Seriously, you cant help but dance in your seat listening to any Michael Jackson song!!  This show covered them all!!  This was our 6th Cirque show and it is one of our favorites.  It isnt a typical Cirque show filled with crazy stunts and acrobatics but the music, dancing and creativity make up for it!  Our favorite part was the MJ hologram.  I get chills every time I think about it because it looked so real!  This is a definite must see in Vegas!!"
MJ One,"I absolutely loved this show. It was the last Cirque show that I had not seen in Vegas. It did not disappoint.  I still think O is the best but my mom liked MJ better. And I have to admit. It was more fun than O. Breathe taking no. But tons and tons of great music and bboy dancing that I couldnt resist dancing in my seat too:) Go, youll have a great time with no regrets:)"
MJ One,"Love the show! Great performers, beautiful costumes and Bad-ass music. I would totally recommend this show to those looking for a good Cirque du Soleil show."
MJ One,"A must see show!!! One of the best Ive seen yet! Regardless of whether or not you loved Michael Jackson, it will make your heart pound. Truly amazing!"
MJ One,My husband has always been a big fan of Michael Jackson. So we came to see the show while in Vegas.We were very disappointed with Cirque du Soleil production. I think the show is very plain and misses a lot of dances and acrobatic acts.The only great thing about the whole show was Michael Jackson hologram.
MJ One,"Just when i thought life could not get any better!! This show was worth EVERY dime spent.... Okay where do I began? Let me start off by saying this: with all do respect I thought at any given moment that Michael Jackson himself was about to come out and perform! It was like seeing a Broadway performance  one second I was singing alone and the next I WAS CRYING! A must see show... 

I didnt take off STARS for this because I brought my drinks in, however, the drinks were wayyyyyyy over priced and not good from what I heard!  No worries, you can BRING YOUR OWN IN! One more thing, I would not recommend getting any seats close to the stage.  Only because they perform in the air and all around. Better to have a top view seat. 
 
In closing Michael Jackson I will always love you and your music! Cirque du Soleil has done you well!"
MJ One,"Words really cant express how much I loved this show. They played all of MJs greatest hits, from Beat It, to Thriller, to Billie Jean. It brought back so many memories. It was really nostalgic. They incorporated these songs with shear acrobatics, light shows, contemporary dance, MJs hologram, shadow shows, and other creative expressions of Michaels influence. You need to see this performance for yourself to really experience it! I highly recommend it!"
MJ One,"Im still visualizing this awesome show as I write this review. It is one of the best Cirque De Soleils Ive seen in Vegas. I would definitely go and see it again in a heartbeat! And, how the heck did they manage to do a silhouette of Michael Jackson? That blew me away. 

I agree with other reviews in that this is not your typical Cirque show in Vegas; mainly because there are a lot less acrobatics. This show is heavier on dancing and tribute theatricals. Me personally, I wouldve appreciated more acrobatics, but I still enjoyed the show.

Go see it for yourself. If youre a true Michael Jackson fan then youll love it. If you think youll have heartburn over $300+ tickets for two and a minimal amount of the usual Cirque acrobatics, then give it a second thought."
MJ One,"Im not going to repeat what everyone else has already said about their favorite songs or dance routines because there is no possible way I could choose. I felt like I was finally attending the concert I have always wanted to go to, but my idol was missing. It was sad and thrilling all at the same time. 

I love how Cirque did such a great job with compiling all of the hits that we know and love with his new songs that we will grow to love as our hearts heal. I know that I cant bear to listen to the new songs at this time so Im not familiar with them. 

My overall take away was how accepting of others Michael really was. He sang about love, conservation, acceptance, healing our past as people that have hurt each other due to racism and other forms of bias and prejudice. His dancing was a distraction to get the messages soaked into our hearts and minds. 

Go to be entertained and leave enlightened."
MJ One,"Okay, just make plans right  now to see this show twice - maybe even three times.  There is So. Much. Going. On.  Youll have to go back again to catch what you missed. The sound system is fantastic and even if you came of age in the Michael Jackson era, you will still be amazed at his portfolio of work--which this show does justice to.  There are aerialists...acrobatics...dancers...smoke...fog.  I cant fully explain it. 
Just go."
MJ One,"Undeniably, the best Cirque du Soleil show EVER!  &amp; I have seen 10 before this one!  Michael Jackson would have been proud!

The theater was large &amp; we were seated in the top, center section &amp; still had a good view.  Make sure to bring a sweater because it gets very cold.

The production was so creative with all of the acts &amp; tied them perfectly with all of the songs.  I enjoyed the fact that they also chose songs from the Jackson 5!  Acrobatics, shadow dancing, overall phenomenal dancing, &amp; (spoiler alert) a hologram, all were amazing &amp; made the audience dance &amp; sing along!"
MJ One,I was a tad bit disappointed. The didnt get the story or the theme or whatever the four random teenagers were about. I found them distracting. The dancing was impressive at times. But Cirque is known for blowing you away and this show did not blow anything away.  I was expecting more Cirque!
MJ One,"This was our THIRD time seeing MJ ONE - it is that good!   From the set to the choreography to the interaction with the performers - it is all first-class, top notch.   The music is a genuine tribute to MJ and highlights all his best music.  The sets are spectacular.  It is not just acrobatics - they feature world-class dancers.  We opted for really good seats (row L) (you DONT want to miss the Dirty Diana pole dancing skit...!).  Some pointers, though:  after the tragic Vegas shooting, security is super high.  You now have to pass through metal detectors to get into the show - AND on top of that, they STILL search purses.  This SIGNIFICANTLY slows down the process, so if you are not there by 6:15 pm (for the 7 pm show), you WILL MISS the beginning.   Several people were seated 10-15 minutes into the show, which was distracting."
MJ One,"ONE fantastic show!

REMEMBER THE TIME:  Ive been fan of Michael Jackson since my youth.  I can vividly recall listening to his Thriller, Bad, and Dangerous albums.  When the opportunity arose to see this production in Las Vegas, I knew I couldnt pass up this chance.  Many thanks to fellow Yelper Rod U. for procuring the awesome seats.

ROCK WITH YOU:  This production is in residence at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.  If youve never been to a Cirque show, be not afraid as the staff are well organized in guiding guests to their seats and/or helping them find their way around the theatre.

BLACK OR WHITE:  One noticeable aspect of this show are the costumes.  The staff meet, greet, and photograph guests in eye-catching red trench coats, black fedora, and sunglasses.  The clothing worn by the performers are a true ode to the King of Pop, especially the talented young man who is show cased during breaks in the performance.  Costumes are black, white, colorful, whimsical, and bright to say the least.

HUMAN NATURE:  Its difficult not to get engrossed with the show and sing along to the music of MJ.  All his hit songs are showcased during the 90 minute production, and by the end, I was one of many who were clapping and singing along to the tunes.

THRILLER:  Being a Cirque du Soleil production, the performers definitely add their touch of acrobatics and thrills to the show, but not overly done as to outshine the music.  Although there is a Cirque touch, there is also a lot of choreography involved, especially many group numbers/dances.  As mentioned earlier, the young man who mirrors many of Michael Jacksons signature dance moves was a definite highlight.  His moon walk was extraordinary indeed.  

THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL:  This was my favorite part of the show!  It was just immense fun!

YOU ROCK MY WORLD:  An amazing, amazing show!!  Highly recommended.  By the end you will be dancing in your seats surely."
MJ One,OMG a five rating for sure. Best money spent all week. The man himself would of enjoyed this show.
MJ One,"FIRST THINGS FIRST.... This show is LOUD AF!!! Border line concert, feel it in your body loud. Acoustics are amazing though, but if youre sensitive to loud sounds and noises, you might want to skip this show.

The show definitely pays an amazing tribute to the many MJ hits, and the performers do a great job keeping you entertained. If youve ever been to other Cirque du Soleil shows, it has most of the same acrobats, trampolines, ropes, stunts, etc so it was no surprise to see these performers. A lot more dancing, bustin out all of MJs signature moves and outfits. Every one did an amazing job and some of the acts were more captivating than others, but not one part of it was bad or slow. There was one point where my wife was crying since it was pretty much a reflection of MJ in his early years."
MJ One,"Not enough superlatives to describe this show. Trust the word-of-mouth from anyone whos seen MJOne... It is fantastic. Beyond fantastic. The theater is great at Mandalay Bay (really comfortable seats), the sound system is TOP notch... and the talent in this show is incomparable, amazing. So much entertainment packed into this show. Dont try and compare it to other Cirque du Soleil spectacles-- this tribute show is unique, fresh, just spectacular! Such an incredible experience. Dont wait, make a plan to see this right away. Shamone!!!"
MJ One,"One of the sickest shows I have ever seen... No Joke, I left speechless. Such an incredible montage to an amazing individual that did his best as the biggest star of our time to deliver a message of good vs evil and this show did all the justice... enough said"
MJ One,"For MJ fans, it would sure trigger some nostalgic emotions by the selection of songs. 

Overall I would still say its a Cirque de Soleil show - I would have loved to see more MJ elements in the performance, but I am guessing they probably need to get rights to use them so might increase the cost or something. A lot of circus tricks and stunts in the show, and a good dab into 4D effects with liquid drops lightly falling during the Stranger In Moscow song (but it somehow was attached on to my hair and eyebrow and I didnt realize that until I looked in the mirror after a whole night - a bit embarrassing with those white flakes on me that looked like dandruff). I liked very much that it brought MJ to the finale song Man In the Mirror by hologram as if he is with us again, and did the Billie Jean song with the LED light effect that MJ was to use similarly in his This Is It show if it were to happen. It also added a bit of tease, well Vegas, into the Dirty Diana and The Way You Make Me Feel songs. 
Overall I would say its definitely a show worth going to, especially if you like MJs music."
MJ One,"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(233/365) Tribute To The King Of Pop

Well, well, well....Better late than never, right? We jumped on this 2 for 1 offer to see MICHAEL JACKSON ONE, so we texted a few cool peeps to come along, and one by one they texted back ILL BE THERE! After all, Ive been WORKING DAY AND NIGHT and needed a break so this was a treat! The day comes to pick up the tickets and our ticket attendant shows us the seats available which were pretty high up, then I thought Wow, THEY DONT REALLY CARE ABOUT US!? then he assured us that there wasnt really any BAD seat in the house....

The day of the show arrives, and eager with anticipation, we are directed to our seats and waiting for the show...CAN YOU FEEL IT? The excitement in the air, the paparazzi snapping pictures getting everyone hyped up for this THRILLER of a show? Make sure you go to the bathroom before the show starts because you do not want to miss a second if and when HUMAN NATURE calls.....The lights go down,  the hits come on, the dance moves electrify the crowd, the acrobatics come from every which way, then...a big thud on the back of my chair! I give this man a look, like Dude, I know youre hyped as I am right now, but THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL right now? Its more like...you WANNA BE STARTIN SOMETHIN? Otherwise, just LEAVE ME ALONE so I can hear my JAM sucka!

Messages of faith, hope, and love are in a few of MJs hits like EARTH SONG and I JUST CANT STOP LOVING YOU, and the tempo of the show heats up with a very athletic pole artist with DIRTY DIANA where she handles not one, not two, but three different poles making each stunt look very DANGEROUS! The highlights for me were definitely SMOOTH CRIMINAL (That lean tho....whooooooo!) BILLIE JEAN where everyones suits were lit up, bustin sick moves on stage, in the air and OFF THE WALL...MAN IN THE MIRROR gave me serious goosebumps AKA chicken skin seeing MJs hologram and made me regret even more the reality of not being able to see a live performance of the most electrifying entertainer in our lifetime...Damn you, Dr. Murray!!!!!!......:(

DONT STOP TIL YOU GET ENOUGH is exactly how I felt...I didnt want the show to end because I didnt feel like I got enough...It was that good! For those of you who were underwhelmed by MJ One,you can just BEAT IT if you didnt care for the show! One things for sure though...Whether youre BLACK OR WHITE, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, etc.tons of fans still exist, and Michael Jackson has definitely left his iconic mark on this world...ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  5"
MJ One,"Michael Jackson One is the only Cirque du Soleil show that Ive seen, and Im so glad I picked this show as my first one: it was absolutely amazing!!  Im not all that incredibly entertained by circus stunts - I enjoy good music and dancing more.  This show had tons of excellent music and dancing!  

I love, love, love MJ songs.  This show featured Michaels biggest hits, which happen to be my favorites.  If you are a big fan of Michael and/or his music, you will love this show too!  It was hard not to dance in my seat!  Even if you arent the biggest MJ fan, this show has something for everyone: the music, the dancing, fun stunts, and amazing special effects.  Pacing was really good too.  Ballads and slower songs were followed by more upbeat numbers, and the show was a fast-paced hour and a half.  I kept looking at my watching wishing the show would not come to an end!    

I sat in the middle floor section about 12 rows up, which might be the highest tier as far as pricing goes.  I can see why: the vantage point from there was excellent, save for some tall people in the way :p  Youll see performers not only on the main stage but off to the sides, in the back, up above you, even on the aisles.  The show, I felt, was worth every penny, and I couldnt stop talking about it after.  I would absolutely see it again, and would maybe choose to sit up closer to get a better look at all the performers.  The misfit Clumsy - holla!!  Lol.  There are four main characters in the show that are called misfits; get there early for the pre-show and you will see why.  Clumsy is a slackliner and does some pretty cool stuff during his set, and he was also eye candy for me :p

Bravo to him and all the amazing performers of Michael Jackson One!  Thank you for putting on such an entertaining show!  If I could use one word to describe MJ One: WOW!!"
MJ One,"Phenomenal show and a great tribute to MJ. Very creative renditions of ... well you just have to see it for yourself.  Many standard Cirque characteristics but as usual an awesome unique production.  Note for kids, my 9-year old daughter covered her ears during several pieces as it is generally LOUD."
MJ One,"SPOILER ALERT
The storyline wasnt very good. I liked how they showed Michaels live performances from his concerts but I wish they showed more of him. The dancers were o k but obviously Michael couldve easily outdanced them at his prime. They included quite a lot of his hit songs which I liked, but they didnt use Heal the world or We are the world which sucked for me. My favourite moments include man in the mirror (the hologram of Michael made me feel a bit emotional), human nature, the way you make me feel, smooth criminal and thriller. The ending song (dont stop til you get enough) was very good because they showed glimpses of Michael smiling brightly from various music videos and performances all while the backup dancers performed on stage. I also liked how they included some of his own words and personal messages including the ending poem of will you be there. The second half of the show was much better than the first half which was acceptable I guess. Theres not a lot of acrobatics but since its MJ, dancing is fine. the dancing wasnt super impressive or electrifying... but then again no one can really beat Michael for his songs and live performances. This show was decent."
MJ One,"There does seem to be less Cirque acrobatic stuff and more crazy choreographed dance numbers than the standard Cirque show so the experience is a little different in that respect. This doesnt take away from the show in any way. Its an awesome thing to see. I have no pictures for ya because thankfully they are super strict on no camera usage. They will throw you out if they see em. I wish every live performance was so strict, but I digress. Take the wife. Take the kids and the whole family. Its a great show

Tips: Check Groupon or Vegas.com for tickets. Sometimes they have good deals on this show.

Also, my wife and I sat in the upper balcony section 201. Its a pretty good viewpoint, we had no problem seeing and we enjoyed it. Without spoiling anything,Ill say the show gets a little more interactive for the people sitting down on the first level. if you like being right in the mix shoot for a lower seat. Either way you dont miss anything. All seats seemed great

The show is 90 minutes long and starts promptly. BE ON TIME!  This should go without saying, but aside from the fact that it sucked to have people climbing over us, finding their seats during LIVE theater, they actually missed a couple crowd wowing moments walking in 20 min. late. Dont be that guy. Get your drinks early."
MJ One,"I am not a hard-core MJ fan, but it was an awe-inspiring show. 

Out of 25-ish songs that were played during the show, I probably knew about half of them (Beat It, Bad, Smooth Criminal, Ill Be There, They Dont Care About Us, Wanna Be Startin Somethin, The Way You Make Me Feel, Billie Jean, Thriller, Man in the Mirror, Black or White, Dont Stop til You Get Enough). The more MJ songs you know, the better the experience (the show pretty much played MJ songs from the beginning to the end). You Are Not Alone and Rock With You were not played during the show, but it did not diminish the shows awesomeness. 

Yes, this is not your typical Cirque du Soleil shows where you get one of those life threatening moments (Oh no, he/she is going to fall!), but overall choreograph was beautiful and visual effect was stunning.

***

Highlights:

Billie Jean - The legendary moonwalk moment from the Motown! The MJ pose! The kick! The hat throwing! The MJ scream! MJ overload! Not to mention dancers were wearing light-up suits all with synchronized movements!

Smooth Criminal - Dat 45 degree lean! 

Thriller - The infamous zombie dance! 

Man in the Mirror - A hologram of MJ! The overall theme matched the lyrics very well. It was a very emotional moment and the song almost brought tears to my eyes.

***

Expect 70% dancing, 15% tribute to MJs music and vision on life, and 15% story plot (about 4 kids navigating through MJs world of music / dance). It does feel like either you love or hate this show, but I REALLY like this show and it is a must watch for all MJ fans.

Hail to the King of Pops!"
MJ One,"Loved it.  Michael Jackson One Cirque Du Soleil is part concert, part circus, and part MJ tribute.  

The show does a good job of highlighting the versatility and evolution of MJ throughout his career, showing the true artist he was.  The dancers, circus performers and special effects are great. There are mood changes as they play with your emotions and (spoiler alert!) the avatar appearance of MJ at the end is mesmerizing.

If youre an MJ fan, see this show!  It was a fun trip down memory lane, and made me wish I was a back-up dancer."
MJ One,"We just returned from a three-night trip to Las Vegas and were fortunate enough to see the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One show.  It was truly amazing and a feast for the eyes!

I had originally purchased three tickets in the nose bleed section (very last row).  We were running late to this show and arrived about five minutes prior to the start.  In this instance arriving late was a good thing for us as the usher asked if we would like to sit further down and closer to the stage.  The usher took us about fifteen rows deep from the front of the stage and we were in the middle of the row, so about dead even center stage!  That was an amazing and timely upgrade!  I did tip the usher $10 and told him thank you very much and he seemed happy with that.

Again, the show was amazing and breathtaking.  There are so many things happening that it is almost sensory overload but in a good way.  I would recommend that everybody takes an opportunity to see this show.  Truly a five-star production!"
MJ One,"Just go. Even if you arent a huge MJ fan, this high energy, fun, and entertaining show has restored my faith in Vegas shows after disappointment at Mat Franco, Britney, and Zarkana. (You shouldnt start your Vegas trips with La Reve and Absinthe, or your expectations become unrealistic for everything else...)

The facts:
- Small enough theater that theres no bad seat in the house. 
- Fun acrobatic shows alternated between choreographed dance routines, all set to MJ music
- Lots of variety in acts. PLENTY of effects, holographs, video, and bigger screen coverage of acrobatic acts. 
- Your senses are largely involved and overwhelmed with lots of things going on at once! Sober this is awesome. Drunk Im sure its even better. For the rollers, be prepared for the best day of your life. 

Tips: 
- If you arrive closer to 9, chances are front valet at Mandalay will tell you they are at full occupancy. Go ahead and park at West Valet. There was almost no wait to get our vehicle after the show! 
- If money is a factor, buy the $125 ticket over the $160 ticket. Its not a terrible difference. I wouldnt personally pay $160 to see this since thats a LOT of money, and Id rather burn the difference while trying to fabricate false hopes at the blackjack table.
- Bring a jacket! I brought a cardigan but half ended up on top of the friend next to me as I wore a knee-length dress. (Combat survival taught me that getting naked is the best source of body heat, but thats just not acceptable outside of Spearmint Rhino and Crazy Horse 3...yet)

I experienced no disappointment at all during this show, which literally takes... talent. This is so perfect for all age groups that Ill be back with my mom next time!"
MJ One,"#1 - It is MJ music
#2 - Our seats got upgrade

Performers were great.  A lot of dancing, I loved it!  Mix of acrobatics with some MJ dance moves mixed in.  The special effect were cool.  Ok, really cool!  The story line is what confused me.  LOL!  I was like WHAT?  Any who the music was good, I got up to shake it a little.  :)"
MJ One,"A MUST see!! This show is a beautiful, moving and appropriate tribute to Michael Jackson and his music. The amazing acrobatics, silk work and dance were top notch...the interactive nature of the show Is very effective and well done without being a hindrance to other parts of the presentation. The end of the show has a very special twist that is possibly the most heart wrenching moment of the show."
MJ One,"All I can say is WOW! Ok Ill say more but WOW should set the tone for this review!!

My son and I love Micheal Jackson and as a surprise I got my family and I tickets to see the show! Boy were they surprised!!!! 

They have a cool little store that was not over priced and my son got a snazzy MJ hat and T Shirt! Staff was super nice  and they have an entire wall of MJ Memorabilia like his Penny Loafers and diamond socks! A lot of pictures along the walls and columns so you could take pics to remember the awesomeness. 

The show was phenomenal, it was all of it and then some and I dont want to give it away but I will say my son has Autism so he isnt too emotional when it comes to certain things and he told me after the show that his eyes were crying because it was so good and he was so happy! 
I cant lie I cried too, it was so nice and brought back happy childhood memories about him and the great music he created. He was truly a genius and it was also sad to think how he died and all the music we are missing out on. 

If you are a MJ lover you should Check it out and bring some tissue!!"
MJ One,"Great show, but you know that so this is a Row note. Sec 102 row S are really good seats. You see the stage well and get actor interaction. Its on the handicap row they have bigger seats that they can move to accommodate wheelchairs or big guys with long legs. Id consider a handicap row if you need extra leg room. Really had a great experience!"
MJ One,"I thought it was good, but i went to the show thinking it was like the other Cirque shows...  Love, O, Mystere...   it is NOT!  but that doesnt mean it wasnt good, it just didnt have the complexity and layers of a Cirque show.  It was a celebration of Michael Jacksons music with dancers and videos.  No special stage, Some acrobatic, but more of a distant side show (not really exciting)...  it was mostly dancing and videos.  The 3 star rating is because with the cirque name I expected more layers and more exciting acrobatic acts...  maybe they shouldnt market it as a Cirque Show...  just a Michael Jackson show, I still would have paid but wouldnt have had such high expectations.  If you love MJ, youll love the show.  If you go because its a Cirque Show, you might not be impressed."
MJ One,"EPIC!  

I totally agree with many of the previous reviews-this is by far the best Cirque Du Soleil show yet!  Even if youre not a fan of Michael Jacksons music-I can guarantee youll enjoy the show and if you ARE a fan of his music, well then youll totally appreciate the songs they interpret and perform too.  It just makes the show that much more amazing if youre a fan of Michael Jacksons music.  

PRE-SHOW
Try to get there early-the lines are long.  Once they open the theater, the line goes quickly but there are a ton of photo ops at the entrance of the theater so you should arrive early to get some pics taken.  There are a ton of large posters, walls and displays with Michaels photos on them and you can totally take pictures of them.  As you enter, theres a professional photo op where you can stand on the Hollywood red star w/Michaels name and your printed photo will be available after the show.  Even in the theater, a different photographer came to take some pictures of us and they were also available for purchase after the show.  They also have a concession stand where you can buy popcorn for the show.  

GET YOUR SOCKS KNOCKED OFF
The show was absolutely breathtaking from beginning to end and it felt like the show lasted for only 20 minutes even though the show went on for almost 2 hours.  The show starts off with some kids playing and they come across Michaels glove and they were told not to touch it.  Of course, one of them touches it and the kids run away.  Then the show breaks off into many of Michaels hits and is accompanied by some really spectacular dancing.  The choreography and timing of it all is just awesome.  They not only dance, but they do flips and jumps.  My absolute favorite part of the show was when they played Dirty Diana and this really toned female worked not 1, not 2, but 3 poles.  She was really athletic and man, she can work a pole!  

POST SHOW
The photographers who took our pictures gave us little tickets wit their names on them.  Basically, they set up shop right outside of the theaters entrance and you can take a look at your pictures and decide if you want to purchase them.  This area becomes a mad house as everyone is crowding around the tables.  

The show is absolutely amazing and if youre going to Las Vegas and can only see one show I would definitely go and see this one.  You wont regret it."
MJ One,"I had to come up with more than just WOW... So here I go 1st I was never a huge MJ fan... But...OMFG this show is Stupendous,Phenomenal, Spectacular, Extraordinary, and very impressive...Well done!!! The music is loud, the sets are amazing, the dancers, sky/aerial performances are breathtaking... trampolines and acrobatics are fantabulous!!! The videos and holograms go above and beyond your expectations... OMFG WOW AMAZING SHOW Couldnt stop dancing through the whole show, Of course Im pretty sure I didnt burn as many calories as the actual dancers in the show... But I had a great time...Get your tickets get to Mandalay Bay and have FUN!!!"
MJ One,"If youre an MJ fan then youll enjoy this show. It wasnt the best show Ive ever seen but it was very entertaining and I enjoyed it immensely. 

I did extensive research before purchasing my ticket. I wanted to make sure Id pick one of the better seats in the house. I ended up getting seats about 6 rows from the stage. I would have liked to have been a little higher up but the seat I got was okay. I was able to see everything pretty well and I didnt have to crane my neck too much.

I got to the venue early to check out the gift shop and wander around the theatre. The gift shop offers an array of items but I honestly wasnt that impressed with the selection. Aesthetically, I just didnt find most of items (t-shirts, jackets, hats) all that attractive. I finally settled on a magnet and a tank top. The tank top of $45 but well worth it in my opinion. I figured I might as well splurge since Ill probably never see the show again.

Id never seen a cirque show before this one. I wasnt overly impressed honestly but I still enjoyed it. It was non-stop high energy movement and excitement. I would have liked to hear a few songs that werent played and I could have done without a few songs they played but overall I was happy. 

The one thing I didnt like were the people who came to the show late. A number of people came well after the show started and we constantly had to get up so they could sit down. That was disruptive to those of us who were there on time and in our seats. I think they should shut the doors after the show starts and not allow people to waltz in late.

The snacks are overpriced but thats expected given that its Vegas. The show started on time so get there early. The gift shop remained open following the show but if you prefer crowd free shopping visit the store before the show."
MJ One,"Ive seen many Cirque Du Soleil shows and this is my favorite. There was not a dull moment (as in the usual clown act while the other performers prep for the next act). From the moment we entered the lobby, the excitement and Michael Jackson theme was apparent. The pseudo paparazzi take photos of guests and put them into tabloid ad photos used before the show.  A fun idea. We were seated 4 rows from the stage. It was great to feel a part of the show being so close and having the show be interactive with the audience at times. I think seating in the back center would have been fine since the theater is not that large.

There was more dancing than acrobatics. The style in which the Cirque du Soleil acts were blended with Michael Jackson songs, was very artistic. The hologram of Michael was my favorite, and I also liked the Jackson 5 song.

There is no intermission, just non stop music, dancing, and acrobatics. This show is a must see if you are a Michael Jackson fan."
MJ One,"Im just totally speechless.  I cant even begin to describe how awesome that show was.  All I can say is, put it on your bucket list.  Hands down the BEST show Ive seen in my entire life, and its not even close.  Seriously.  Its that good.  You cant go to Vegas and not see this show."
MJ One,"Absolutely incredible. 
Being a fan of Michael Jackson my expectations were high. I went to the show thinking that it was going to be mediocre because it wasnt an actual Michael Jackson concert. To my surprise, it was breathtaking. It far exceeded anything I had thought. Great production, its a must see while in Vegas."
MJ One,"This is my favorite Cirque show ever. We liked it so much that we saw it twice while we were in Vegas for the week. Its more dance heavy than some Cirque shows (its MJ, duh), but theres still the classic tumbling &amp; aerial work weve come to know &amp; love. I squealed like a giddy elementary schooler during Thriller. There was even an appearance by the King of Pop himself. 

Even if you arent an MJ fan, if youre a lover of stunning choreography &amp; mind boggling circus tricks (spoiler alert: theres a guy with one leg who can do more than I can do with my 2 good legs!), go see it. Its absolutely worth it."
MJ One,"Great show! The performers were great. My favorites were the guitarist and pole dancer. Show is full of strobe lights, bright colors and loud music. I wouldnt recommend for smaller children (younger than like 10). The venue is smallish and the stage is raised so I wouldnt recommend sitting right in the front. We initially had seats in the very back, but one of the hosts moved us to a closer seat. Even if we hadnt been moved, we still would have been able to see everything fine. It made me want to go watch a bunch of MJ videos afterwards. If you are on Vegas and like MJ, definitely go see the show."
MJ One,The the best show I have ever seen!!!!! So worth it and will see it again.  They even upgraded our seats with no additional cost.
MJ One,Best show I have seen by far! We had tickets in the second row to the right of the stage. I would recommend seats in the center toward the middle for a better view. Great dancing and performances. Totally worth the price!
MJ One,"I saw Cirques Micheal Jackson ONE show last night, and it was the most amazing show Ive ever seen!  From the music to the choreography, it was PERFECTION! They even projected a hologram of MJ on the stage so that it felt like he was there!   If you do nothing else in Vegas, make sure you see this show.  I do wish they would go on the road so that more people could see this show."
MJ One,"Wonderful show! Everything is above expectations(to answer to someones review that is average Vegas show): performance, light, music (of course). Cirque du Soleil is amazing as always. Bravo!"
MJ One,"In a world filled with hate, we must still dare to hope. In a world filled with anger, we must still dare to comfort. In a world filled with despair, we must still dare to dream. And in a world filled with distrust, we must still dare to believe. ― Michael Jackson

I got to watch this amazing show on Friday, November 13th with excellent seating in Section 103, Row E, and Seat 1.  All I can say is WOW!  This isnt my first show in Vegas but its definitely the most memorable.  It all started when the red-jacketed paparazzi/stalkers strutted over to stare me down, which resulted in me blowing kisses at them, and later having the mic shoved in my face for interviews.  So this is how the King of Pop must have felt.  And then a peculiar guy ran on stage, looking like a mix of Ash Ketchum and Marty McFly with his trusty companions where *the glove*, *the hat*, *the sunglasses*, and *the shoes* lead them on a glamorous and magical journey of some of the greatest MJ hits of all times.  

They Dont Care About Us, Thriller, Billie Jean, and more echoed across the theater while performers dangled from the ceiling, entertainers scaled the walls, and more.  No matter where you look, there was always something to keep you mesmerized.  A beautiful lady sails across the air on a crescent moon throne, trampolines, aerial silk, rope work, the sexiest pole dancer, a bad ass guitarist, and other memorable acts dazzled the crowds.  Macaulay Culkin and an anime sequence suddenly plays, guys are juggling hats onto their heads, a guy in crutches tears up the stage, and the gentleman with the most serene smile in black and sequins leaves you breathless.  Oh, give me *the hat*, handsome!  Of course there were unforgettable MJ costumes, moonwalks, the Smooth Criminal anti-gravity leans, and crotch grabs.  A 4D hologram of the King of Pop singing Man in the Mirror before turning back into a young MJ brought tears to my eyes.  Such a beautiful tribute to a legend and a true artist.  My hands were red from clapping and my voice was raw from cheering.  I was touched.  I was in awe.  I loved it.

A star can never die. It just turns into a smile and melts back into the cosmic music, the dance of life. ― Michael Jackson

Long live The King."
MJ One,A must for 70s &amp; 80s babies. Makes you want to get up and dance. Favorite performances were Billy Jean and The Way She Makes Me Feel. One of my Joe favorites of the Cirque Soleil Shows next to The Beatles LoVe Show.
MJ One,"I loved it. I was riveted the entire time and actually wish it had been longer. And I tend to think all the shows are too long.

My seat was in the very last row, but I still had a great view of everything. In fact, I wouldnt advise sitting any closer than the halfway point or youll miss some of the portions that involve coming down from the ceiling.

There wasnt really any clips, photos, or songs used that arent already widely known. The songs were kinda like a greatest hits list with several of the new songs from the History album (Stranger in Moscow, They Dont Care About Us, etc.).

It was an excellent mix of acrobatics and dance. And there were lots of neat visuals and cool effects. I do wish some of the dance sequences had been more complex, but they were still good.

I would go back again and see it right now. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. Now, of course, it probably helps that Im a casual MJ fan. Im not sure my parents, for example, would particularly enjoy the show. But as far as Im concerned, its a definite go-see and 5 stars."
MJ One,"This show was something Id been looking forward to for months!

I have a bedroom decorated for him in my Tahoe home.

The show was epic, as most of the cirques are, lots of acrobatics, gymnastics and a contortionist ( no joke )

Of course all the favorites you would expect, but very politically themed
and the horrible paparazzi treatment he endured for his entire adult life.
They had a hologram of Michael singing Man in the Mirror was so realistic, I have never seen a hologram in a show, very cool.

This was a great choice for us that prefer this over Donnie &amp; Marie or Britney
Spears Major Gag lol, to each his own!

I really enjoyed the show and we had decent seats"
MJ One,"Cirque du Soleil always manages to impress with their in-sync choreography, amazing acrobatics, and, in this show, awesome music! Now, I appreciate Michaels music and good music in general, but I am in no means a Michael Jackson follower. I only knew about 2 of the songs, only snippets of other songs, and in some cases, none of it at all. However, that didnt take away from the experience at all!

The story was really clever, and really showcases the iconic pieces of Michael Jacksons stardom! This show was really entertaining! I can only imagine what the real Michael Jackson shows were like!"
MJ One,"One of the best Cirque shows ever!!! Amazing tribute to Michael Jackson and loved everything about the show!!! Such an amazing tribute and with so much energy. 
The theatre is located in Mandalay Bay Hotel near the connecting entrance of Delano. I mean what else can I say...its a tribute to Michael Jackson and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! Music and dance routines that made him who he was in the music industry!! 
Everything was very organized and they had enough staff to accommodate guests. Must watch!!"
MJ One,"If youre looking for a family show to watch in Vegas, This Is It (ha! get it?).  

After you enter the theatre, there will be people (dressed as MJ) taking your picture while you pose on the red carpet and while youre in your seat in hopes that youll purchase these pictures after the show ($45/booklet, each booklet contains 3 pictures). 

I was able to snatch some 3rd row seat tickets so my view was amazing the whole night.  However, if youre afraid your neck might ache, I advise sitting a couple rows back to prevent that but still have a great view.  

All the performers were amazing and talented - tons of flips/acrobatics and dancing (MJ moves), of course since this is Cirque du Soleil after all. The costumes were pretty extraordinary, and they did a great job bringing MJs music videos to life.  All the performances were good, but I thought Thriller was the best. 

The show is 90 minutes long (no intermission) with two evening shows to choose from: 7pm or 9:30pm - perfect event to start off your night in Vegas.

Wish MJ was still alive so I could see him perform live in concert.  However, I can settle for this."
MJ One,"Make the MJ One show part of your Vegas experience!  It was hands down the highlight of my 4 days there.

*Arrive at least 30 minutes before showtime to take photos in front of the life-size dancing Michaels, visit the gift shop, and buy themed cocktails and snacks.  I love how everyone from the bartenders to the ushers were dressed in the military-inspired Michael outfits!!  :)  

*There doesnt seem to be a bad seat in the house.  We had tickets toward the back of the bottom section, and close to an aisle: TRY to get tickets close to an aisle, especially if you have a child with you!!  The dancers, trapeze artists, etc. use the aisle a lot and will interact with you. There was a little girl in our aisle and I was jealous at all the attention she got.  GRRRR 

*As a Super-fan, I appreciated that they incorporated lesser-known MJ songs.  Awesome.  They also mashed up several songs together which sounded great!  Highlight for me was Strangers in Moscow.. and Smile!  Not a lot of people know this, but it was Michaels favorite song and he recorded it live with an orchestra, first take.  Smile, though your heart is aching.. smile, even though its breaking..

*However, I sat next to people who werent super-fans and they still danced in their seats.  The music is just that good!  Plus, the performances of the Cirque troop were phenomenal.  The blonde girl playing electric guitar was fantastic, we all know Michael used a blonde on his tours...  The show got a standing ovation at the end from everyone.

If this town is just an apple, then let me take a bite - MJ, Human Nature.  Take a bite of the Vegas apple and go see this show."
MJ One,"I grew up listening to MJ so I was super hyped up to see this show. This show didnt seem to meet my expectations. At times I wish I had brought my sunglasses to the show. The lights were very bright and flashing throughout. I think there should be a warning for those who could potentially suffer from seizures due to the multitude of flashing lights. I didnt quite get the story line and the hologram of MJ was not proportional to the size of the real performers on stage. It was a good effort but I much prefer a show like Mystere and Ka where I was immediately wowed by the artistry of the performers and the costumes designs.

Nonetheless, I shouldnt fail to mention that the performer with one leg and in crutches blew me away with his dance moves. He gave a captivating performance that even two-legged persons may not be able to match....phenomenal moves."
MJ One,"I really enjoyed this show.  They really captured the essence of Michael: King of Pop, humanitarian and simply a great entertainer.  

Tips:
*If you can get an aisle seat, there is a lot of action there
*Make sure you use the potty before and get a double at the bar, no intermissions
*There are cupholders to stash your drinks directly in front of you
*Dont holler during the acts, lucky me the row of gals behind us were rambunctious and were warned several times during the show
*If you want to see crazy human feats, this show is not for you

Cool choreography and some moves from current reality show groups.  Loved all the sparkly costumes and the bright hair, well thought out and provided a punch.  A variety of sets, engaging acts and slight story line.  

Always love MJ and this show paid homage to his life and legacy.  Everyone was jazzed during the show and left with smiles on their faces."
MJ One,"THE BEST SHOW EVER! My daughter and I came on a Sunday evening 7pm show (Memorial Day Weekend). In row 4, middle: best seats ever!! The amazing talent of everyone and music had me LIT UP for 90 minutes of pure ENJOYMENT! LOVED IT! Worth it! A lifetime memory!!"
MJ One,"I loved Michael when I was little so I had to see this show.

The stage and side panels are beautiful as you can see from the video. The lighting and graphics will blow you away! I liked the pre-show music, but cant find it anywhere. The songs are all remixed.

This show focuses on the dance of Michael Jackson with some acrobatics, I wish there was more acrobatic performances, but its still good.

This show is a tribute to the memory and music of Michael Jackson and his message that we are all ONE"
MJ One,"GO SEE THIS SHOW!!!
Mi lady Niki K broke down the deets already! Any MJ fan would love this show to death! Shoutout to the crew for putting on an AMAZING SHOW!

The tickets are pricey, but if you can put out to see lion king on Broadway NYC, then you can def do this show. Its extremely interactive if sitting close to stage. All I can say is watch the aisle and watch the ceiling. 

Im not sure why anyone would rate this show below a 4 stars, but maybe Im biased as I grew up with MJ so appreciate the show more. GO SEE it!"
MJ One,"Are you kidding me??? The best part of this show was Michaels music in full surround sound and the hologram effects at the end, the only reason for the 2 stars. What a waste! Dont waste your money or time on this one. Very mediocre and overrated performances and for 3 people; my wife, son and myself, youll spend a fortune and wonder for what? And where did they cast these women from that the songs highlight? More like cheap looking hookers then seductive beauties! But I guess thats more the fault of the makeup artists and costume designers. Sorry for being so blunt, just the opinion of my entire family.

My first Cirque du Soleil and very disappointed."
MJ One,Great show! Very typical of cirque du soleil to be awesome once again! Not dropping stars because of this but there was a lot of dust used during the performance which caused me to get super congested. Worth every penny!
MJ One,"Awesome show!  I had seen the Immortal Tour when it was in Vegas a few years back and was not impressed.  I am happy to say One is much better.  Only a few elements of Immortal made it to One.  I was entertained from beginning to end.  I loved the dancing, acrobatics and of course the music!  Yes it has a lot more dancing then other Cirque shows but I thought this fit in well with the show.  MJ is known as much for his dancing and his music.  They definitely did him justice.  I would recommend getting seats a little further back to easily view all that is going on around the theater.  

Every year on Michaels birthday (August 29th) the cast and crew of One and Michaels estate hold a celebration of his life with special events during the day.  This year it included special performances, Q&amp;A with the artists, meet and greets with the estate and a book signing.  All included with your ticket for either of that evenings shows.  Unfortunately I wasnt able to attend these events.  Hopefully next year.  Thanks to Yelp and Cirque Du Soleil for the ticket."
MJ One,"I love Cirque shows! This is definitely a good one especially is you like pop music and Michael Jackson! Duh. Lol. 
The specialty cocktails are very tasty. If you get one of those large ones its good enough for the entire show! 
If you love Michael Jackson and want to see a good Vegas show, go and check it out!!
Great music, great dancing and a good storyline."
MJ One,"LOVED. THIS. SHOW. 

Came here last weekend with some good friends. They purchased tickets and we were seated about 3 rows from the back. When we came in, we were offered a seat upgrade to the 9th row... THE 9TH ROW! What a surreal experience. 

Just a disclaimer, dont actually watch this show if youre not a fan of Michael Jackson... that doesnt make sense. If youre sensitive to noise, bring earplugs; each seat has its own speaker that is right in front of your face. I didnt have a problem with the loudness of the show, because I felt like I was able to get more immersed into the story/acts. 

When you first come in, the paparazzo snap a rando photo of you, which ends up projected on the side walls as covers on fake tabloids with hilarious headlines. I was super confused as to why they snapped one right away as we walked in and it took me a hot second to realize what it was for, but once I did, it was more than entertaining to watch the rotating pictures/tabloids pre-show. 

Additionally, as pre-show entertainment, they had a group of the paparazzo meander about the theater and crowd around certain people to take pictures and video of them, making quite a scene. Hilarious. 

Now the show, without giving too much away, was engaging, entertaining, lively, innovative, and energetic. Ive seen a handful of other Cirque shows and this show has definitely moved to the top of my list. The dancing, the lights, the costumes, the acrobatics, and the cast all have brilliantly captured the spirit of MJ. 

Kudos to the crew for an amazing production. My jaw was dropped for a good amount of this show!"
MJ One,"Awesome show!!!!
Not as many acrobatics as other shows BUT the nostalgia made it well worth it!!!!!!! 
Drinks at the bar are well made and they dont skimp on the alcohol (considering theyre not cheap this was a serious positive).
Would recommend to anyone that is an MJ fan"
MJ One,"This was SO much fun. This was probably the loudest event that I have ever experienced. I am a fan of Michael Jackson, so this was exciting to see. 

There was a lot of action on the stage, and many great acrobatics. This was my first Cirque du Soleil production. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was good. Some parts of the show were outstanding, while others were sort of just okay. I was expecting to see more flying through the air, I suppose. It was a great example of Michael Jackson, what he was about and what he hoped for in the world. 

It was 90 minutes, and very entertaining. Although I could have done without the side story involving the 3 kids throughout the show, I did really like the show as a whole. If you are a Michael Jackson fan, this is a great show to see."
MJ One,"Michael Jackson would be so embarrassed to have his name affiliated with this horrible production! Michael was a perfectionist and so incredibly talented! This show felt like you were watching a high school production. The dancers were horrible! They had no energy! It felt like they were just running through the steps like at  dress rehearsal.  The choreography was terrible as well! We left in the middle, and were not the only ones!
Dont waste your time or money!!! So many great shows out there!!"
MJ One,"What a great show!  The dancers are incredible, the music covers quite a bit of his catalog and the acrobatics are phenomenal!  Highly recommend seeing it.  You wont be disappointed."
MJ One,"If you are in Las Vegas, DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW. 

I wont spoil the magic by giving away too much, but this is the best of many Cirque shows that I have seen. The performers and the production value are on a completely different level. It truly is an unbelievably amazing tribute to the greatest pop star of all time. 

I will 100 percent see this show again and again and again."
MJ One,"I have been conflicted since I saw the show last evening about how to grade it.  I have been between three and four stars.  Im not completely a fan of the show, so Ill give it 3 stars for Cirques pushing the envelope with its technology.

I think you will appreciate the show more if you know Jacksons music--I dont for the most part except the biggest hits and mine might not be the same as anyone elses.  

When you enter the theatre, there are two threads that come into play--one, the constant write ups about Jackson in tabloids and the ceaseless hounding by paparazzi for him more than many entertainers.  The funny faux headlines in these tabloids are fun to read.  My favorite: Man invents his own language - Can only speak to himself.  That shows the idiocy to which some of the tabloids went in creating incredulous stories about Jackson to sell papers.  The other part is the paparazzi, a group of five or six guys going around the theatre taking photos of audience members with one carrying a boom mike.  Another part of Jacksons, or any well known entertainers life in the media world.  The projection on the scrim was a nice touch also.

The show started and there were a few of Jacksons songs with a bit of Cirque circus stuff.  When the songs ended, the Jackson fans in the audience cheered loudly.  Many of the people around me just sat there and didnt applaud.  It was a strange feeling that I cant quite describe.  Something along the lines of, Oh, OK, that songs over.

During the show there is a small amount of circus acts--the trampoline guys and the people climbing and doing tricks on fixed poles rather than the silks that Cirque is so known for.  My feeling was that they should have just left this out.  It really doesnt fit the songs and theres really no purpose except to remind you that youre at a Cirque show.  I wish they had focused completely on the technology and maybe even done more with that.  There is a lot of good music and dancing.  I recognized many of the songs but I wasnt there as a fan of Jackson but a fan of Cirque du Soleil and live entertainment.

The hologram sequence near the end was marvelous.  I think more could have been done with this throughout the show.  Not each number, but more of it.  Push the technology as far as you can and leave the trampolines out.

Finally, I learned for sure that the man in the moon is a lady.  Now youll have to go to see the show to know what I mean.  Theatre goers who know Broadway and see this show will get my double reference in that sentence.  

This is a solid show but needs some tightening.  And, please, have some of the song Will You Be There sung instead of spoken!"
MJ One,"So while were in town for our daughters ballet competition I booked us tickets to Michael Jackson one Cirque du Soleil. We have seen other circus Soleil so were very excited to see this one after reading reviews on yelp.

From the moment we walked in you could tell this is going to be in an outstanding experience by the stage, before show antics of the performers, etc. I will tell you there is not a bad seat in the house but I personally would suggest any seats in the front section towards the back of that front section as there is some overhead performances you will see better that way.

Without giving anything away the show was 1 1/2hrs of nonstop make you think, tear up and pump your fist dance action that we never wanted to stop! There was no intermission and everybody was talking about it walking out of the show!

I havent seen all the shows in Vegas but I have to assume this is one of the very tops and all I can say is SEE IT!"
MJ One,"If you are a Michael Jackson fan, this show is well worth your time and money.  Its about 90 minutes, fast-moving and youll hear a lot of MJ.  The performers are incredible and its a great mix of Cirque awesomeness and MJ moves.  I was awestruck for most of the performance.
The area outside the theater has a few displays of memorabelia, and huge photos of MJ in his prime.  The gift store is way overpriced but there were some cool things.

The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the concession area.  Save yourself the hassle of standing on the slowest moving line ever, and dealing with the most disinterested, slow servers -all for crappy drinks that are overpriced even by Vegas standards. You can bring in your drink from outside the show, there are plastic cups you can use."
MJ One,"This show is AMAZING!!!  My hubby and I LOVED it!  

I read the Yelp reviews, so I knew NOT to expect a regular Cirque du Soleil show that was heavy on acrobatics.  I was a bit bummed by this, since I adore acrobatics.  However, I was blown away by the energy level, music, dancing, and wonder of the show.  

This is a MUST for any lover of Michael Jacksons music  When they showed the hologram of MJ, it was almost like he was there.  The entire show was thrilling from start to end.  I was enthralled!  

All the seats are good, so if money is an issue just get one of the discounted seats in the back.  (think there are only a few per night)  Your view will still be good enough.  On emptier nights, they will just move you forward for free =).

LOVE LOVE LOVE"
MJ One,"If I could give it 6 stars, I would. My husband and I saw this a couple years ago and LOVED it. Since then, we watched O (loved), LOVE (also loved), and KA (meh) and wondered if we would still love it as much the 2nd time around. Short answer -- yes! And wed watch it again. In a heart beat. 

The show is a master piece -- high energy, beautiful imagery/lights, awesome music/sound and a-freaking-mazing performers. There really isnt enough good words to say about it. Its a spectacular experience everyone should see. 

If you arent amazed by the lighted costumes for Billy Jean and dancing I your seat through the last number -- check your pulse because you may be dead. 

I feel this show has more entertainers in the audience - maybe thats just me - but its extremely interactive. All seats are good -- you really get immersed in the experience. 

In short - run, dont walk, to this show. I Promise - youll love it."
MJ One,This is by far the most emotional and entertaining show Ive seen. Its not to be missed. The talent is awesome. Congratulations to everyone in the production. I pushed away the tears and felt the love. Ive seen all the cirque shows in Vegas and this one is the most emotional of them all. Dont miss it. I highly recommend it.
MJ One,"This show was absolutely amazing. The beginning of the show it starts off with a bang and it takes you on this emotional journey of high and lows, awesome and sadness. If youre an MJ fan you can appreciate the dedication that Cirque du Soleil put into his memory and his life. 

No matter where you have a seat, it is always a perfect view to see MJs life message and the power he had over us all. 

10/10 would see this again!"
MJ One,"This was going to be my first Cirque du Soleil show ever! I came here on a Friday night for the 9:30 showing. Got here right as the show was about to start and I was excited. 

We were ushered to our seats and I got stuck sitting behind a man that seemed like he was 7ft tall! I know this isnt the shows fault but it definitely didnt make things better. I had to keep shifting just to get a view of the stage.

Unfortunately, its not like I was missing much. When I hear cirque du soleil I expect tumbling and acrobats. This was not the case for this show. There was minimal tumbling/acrobatic acts in this show. It was just a ton of dancing. If I wanted to watch dancing I wouldve watched the Jabbawockeez! 

The entire time, I was just hoping for the show to end already. The show to me was really weird and boring. Like, I just didnt understand some portions of it. Like When this lady sitting on a half moon was hanging above the stage. She served no purpose! While dancers were dancing beneath her, she just sat there. Although, Im not the biggest Michael Jackson fan I do enjoy his music. I will admit some acts were very good, such as the shadow portion of the show. All the other things were just weird. I felt like I was in the movie Knocked Up where Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen are watching a Cirque Du Soleil showing saying GET ME OUTTA HERE! Only difference was I wasnt on anything. haha Seriously. Did not enjoy the show and I felt like I wasted my money. However I went with a group of 7 other girls and most of them loved it other than me and one other girl. In fact the other girl admitted to me that she FELL ASLEEP in the middle of the show! 

Furthermore, after the show we went to take a look at the picture they took of me and group. I  was able to sneak a picture of the picture and got caught. Security was all over my ass. They just kept hovering behind me and following me everywhere I go. So rude. My cousin ended up purchasing the picture (not because of what I did) and they finally got the security away from breathing down my back. Sheesh. 

What a waste of Friday night for me. In my opinion go somewhere else!"
MJ One,"Im not sure what show all these 4 and 5 star reviewers were watching, but this show was terrible. I love all the other cirque shows Ive seen in Vegas; talent, theme and variety which this show seriously lacked. The only good thing about this show was the original music of MJ, but I could have listened to this for free in my iTunes download and saved my boyfriend $300 for our two tickets in the second mezzanine. Im sure Michael, being the showman he was, would be appalled this is what they put together in his tribute."
MJ One,"This has to be one of the best shows I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of Jackson and felt so upset when he passed. It was on my bucket list to see him in person. This is honestly the next best thing. The visuals are stunning and the music doesnt miss a beat.

Perhaps the best part was the one-legged performer who in my opinion, stole the show. It was truly touching and stood for everything Michael believed in. I think there were moments I had tears of happy in my eyes. It was that good."
MJ One,"I purchased our tickets five months in advance. Get tickets at least row H or further back, and at the aisle. Youre going to want to enjoy the tremendous stage and performers from the ceiling and aisles. Bring earplugs because there are speakers at your seat/headrest and it is LOUD. 

The theater is very close to the Delano. The doors are designed to look like MJs jacket and they have authentic memorabilia in glass cases (his jacket, sequined socks and leather shoes). The gift store sells light up gloves ... popular for kids.

This show was one of my favorite Cirque productions. As my Yelp friend Kent wrote, this is not the typical acrobatic daredevil Cirque. There were some gymnastic feats...jumping and bouncing off walls, tight wires and trampolines, walking on the walls, pole climbing and dancing, and juggling hats but I dont think these were he highlights of the show. The shows stars were MJs hits and Cirques interpretation of them... zombies in the aisles, dancers in lighted suits and the hologram of MJ that looked like he was actually present."
MJ One,Great show. Must see. Wish it was an hour longer because it leaves you wanting more. You will leave having a true appreciation for the talent of the performers.  They did a great job .
MJ One,amazing show brought back old memories love it love it recommended to see in las vegas
MJ One,"Friday 13th 7PM, Mandalay Bay. The show was filled with acrobatic strength, dancing talent and superb audio of Michaels songs.  Also, a stunning illusion of Michael at center stage performing Man in the Mirror with magnificent live dancers... quite a theatrical visual experience,  amazing choreography too.  By the way, our section 103, seats 6, 7, 8 and 9 were excellent (aisle  seating,  last row in 1st section)
Tip: Arrive to your seats early and ask for seat cushion, itll raise the seat 3 inches higher... my wife and daughter were at the same eye level as me."
MJ One,"Not like other Cirque shows, and thats not a good thing.
Its musical, but not like MJ performed.
Its loud.
Its visually cool.
Its loud.
Some standout performances.
Its loud.
If youve never been to Cirque shows, dont start with this one.  For great music more Cirque-like in presentation, go to the Beatles show LOVE at the Mirage.
If youve been to Cirque shows, you may be disappointed.  We were."
MJ One,"A stunning show. Porn for MJ fans, certainly.

If you love his music, its worth the ticket price just to hear the songs on this system. Theyve really gone beyond beyond in terms of sound on this show. Superbly remixed and mastered. Yes, LOUD - but never painfully so. 

Personally, Im not as much a fan of the more dance-centered Cirque shows as I am of the shows that feature amazing things that humans can do. This show heavily features dance, but it seems appropriate for a guy who was known for his ground-breaking, iconic moves.

The acts are definitely well done, if pretty standard Cirque fare.  If you havent seen many of their shows, youll be amazed. I was particularly fond of the adorable aerialist at the beginning of the show, and the amazing golden guitar player. (Please tell me that she was really playing. Her presence on stage is like a force of nature, and her playing is world-class).

In every Cirque show, I hope to see some real beauty, something truly thrilling, and something that I never could have even imagined. This show brings it all on. 

The projections, lighting, and special effects here are in a class by themselves. I promise, youve never seen anything like this before. 

The illuminated costumes - several different types - are truly beautiful. At one point, its as if the night sky comes alive and dances above your head.

My favorite act was actually the shadow play scene. I dont even remember what song it was - I was so engaged in the performance) It was just wonderful - incorporating projected shadows with live performers in a way that it was impossible to tell what was real and what was fx. 

I did see the Cirque MJ Immortal arena show  that toured prior to this. There is very little similarity between the two shows. They did keep some of the best of the tour, but most of it is newly created for this venue. The few things that are re-used play much better in this intimate space. The only things that I missed were the the solo vocals of young Michael singing his sweet ballads. 

As a matter of personal taste, I wouldnt choose this show over Mystere or O. As a musician, I just think that those scores are more interesting, and that the acts are more beautiful. But to each, their own. There is no doubt that this is a brilliant show."
MJ One,"Oh em jay! Did you see how I did that! This show is by far the best Cirque de Soleil show ever. If you are a MJ fan you must see this show! Everything about this show is just amazing. The tickets are pricey, ours were about 150/person but its really worth it. At the bed of the show there is a hologram of MJ and you really feel like you are at an MJ concert. 

The music was great and although our seats were so close we could see some mistakes the acrobats made it was still an off the chart amazing show. 

After a while all cirque de soleil show are the same but this one memorable due to MJ theme. I really love MJ so I truly loved this show. I recommend it and I wouldnt be opposed to seeing it again."
MJ One,"It was a toss-up between one star and two.

For the most part, I hated this show. It was sensory overload, but not in the positive sense of shows like Love or O or Mystere.

I expected a fun night of Michael Jackson songs and Cirque showmanship. Instead, I got a painful 90 minutes devoid of many of the songs I wanted to hear, delivered too loudly, without much to redeem them.

The show was a 50th-birthday-night-out present for my sister-in-law. I ended up feeling terrible for making her first Las Vegas show a thumbs-down experience.

I wouldnt recommend the show even if I hadnt found it unbearably loud, but I should definitely warn ticket buyers that my seat, Section 103, Row L, Seat 10, seemed to align with the shows speaker system in such a way that my head wanted to explode. It was all I could do to stay in my seat for the entire show."
MJ One,"I liked it. Great dancing, great guitarist.!i just didnt feel like it was a Cirque du Soleil show. I think Beatles was better but I am guessing if you are a Michael Jackson fan you will like this show better. If you want more acrobats then the Beatles show. I am a big fan of both and enjoyed the Beatles show better."
MJ One,"80% dancing to MJ music, 20% Cirque du Soleil. Its an elaborate show, with a lot going on including a storyline that seemed like an afterthought. The whole thing felt like an unusually loud live action music video compilation with a few acrobatics mixed in at random intervals.  They must be betting on enough people liking the music to keep it going, but it was really not worth the price for me."
MJ One,"Kinda Disappointed...I expected way more acrobatics and the dancing was subpar. I particularly didnt like the dancers with all the multi colored hair, too distracting and devalued the tribute. It was really poorly done choreography... Forget the $175 I spent, can I have my 2 hours back???..Just kidding, I would love my money back. Id wouldvn rather put it towards a few spins on the $5 slot machines...I cant in good conscious recommend this, much better shows elsewhere."
MJ One,"This cirque du soleil show is located at The Mandalay Bay.  Supposedly this show sells out quickly. We bought our tickets the morning of the show at our hotel concierge. We sat at section 202, row MM, seats 5-8. The seats were not bad at all. The lower seats are good because one of the performers may interact with you. 

Theres a typical snack area with beverages and popcorn. As expected, super expensive. 

If youre looking for lots of acrobatic stunts, this show is NOT for you. This is a tribute to Michael Jackson and theres a lot of dancing and lighting stuff. There is even a hologram of MJ. 

What was disappointing was that they didnt use a lot of his greatest hits.  My favorite parts would be the Billie Jean and thriller. Overall, I wouldnt really recommend this show. If you really like MJ though, you might really love it. We paid about $180 per ticket (altogether with processing fees) and I didnt think it was that worth it to see dancing. Save your money for O."
MJ One,"OMG! This show was recommended by our limo driver who by the way used to live in Hawaii and the woman at the concierge desk also recommended this show. She also has ties to Hawaii, her boyfriend is from the north side.  Anyway, Im so thankful that I listened to them. The One was awesome! This a very high energy show, from beginning to the very end. The price of the seats range from $133 to $196, which includes tax and fees. The woman at the concierge desk gave me a tip...it really doesnt matter where you sit because the show is everywhere. No matter where youre sitting youll be able to see everything.

She was right! There were performers coming down from the ceiling quite often throughout the show. Each performance was big...they used the entire stage. In addition to the dancing, there was lots of amazing acrobatics and the stage effects were impressive. 

I would have loved to share photos of the show, but they did not  allow photography during the performance.

This is a must see whenever youre in Vegas."
MJ One,Blown away! What an amazing performance. MJ would be proud! This is the third show Ive seen in Vegas and it stands out by far. All the Cirque du Soleil acrobats and the dancers are awesome. I need to see it again at least once to really take it all in. So good!
MJ One,"The Show
----------
Michael Jackson fan or not, youre going to love this show. Its the music, the sights and sounds we all grew up to. Cirque du Soleil captures and presents the King of Pop in a celebration performance.  Jam out to Classic Michael hits while experiencing the roller coaster of emotions take you from his early days thought his career.


The Spot
----------
The Mandalay Bay hotel is located at the end of the Las Vegas Strip and out of the tourist hustle and bustle.  From shops, dining to games of chance theres a bit to do before and after the show. The resort is connected to other MGM Grand properties via a free cable shuttle so you can go exploring.


Parking
-------
If youre staying at any of the MGM Grand hotels your parking could be free if you have a reservation through their M-Life service. Otherwise its only $10 for the entire day still not a bad deal since its a flat rate and you can explore the adjoining buildings and the Strip.


Bang-For-The-Buck
--------------------
Yes, yes, yes. Hahahaha.  Though not as much acrobatics as the other Cirque Du Soleil shows that Ive seen it was definitely worth seeing an MJ concert with the expected dramatic showmanship and special effects.  Theres a surprise during the ... well Im not going to spoil that.  Dont sit in the front section.  Theres a lot of thing happening overhead, on the stage and in the aisles that youll miss if you sit of in the front row!  Tip: You will also get a decent discount on performance tickets if you purchase through MGMs M-Life service.


Conclusion
------------
I take it by now youve already purchased your show tickets. Right? If not... what are you waiting for? Definitely a show you need to see while here in Vegas.  Man Im not gonna lie, bring the Kleenex... Half way though the first song and I was choked up. It gets sentimental real quick!  A DEFINITE MUST SEE!"
MJ One,"Before the show was an area to view and take pictures with memorabilia. Once doors opened we were able to purchase signature drinks in a collector cup.

You can never go wrong with Michael Jackson music. The music and dancing and acrobatics was like lively and held our attention. The story line itself was blah, but did not take away to much from the show.

Overall great experience that wii definitely have you dancing smiling and remembering Michael."
MJ One,Paid 100 bucks just to watch a glorified music video. Minimal cirque stunts. There was supposed to be a storyline with some kids but I couldnt follow. I think me and my friends drifted off sometime around Man in the Mirror. And dont get the specialty drinks...each of ours was heavy on the sour and citrus mix that could probably strip clearcoat off you car. Go see one of their mainstay shows like Ka or Zumanity instead...at least the latter has kinda sex involved
MJ One,"This was such a beautiful and touching tribute to Michael Jackson. My only complaint is that it is a bit of a sensory overload. The music is a touch too loud, the lights were a few too many. Otherwise the acts were amazing, and the music was great. I would recommend it. The venue is great, and you can see well from any seat."
MJ One,"Were huge fans of Cirque, though we only have a passing knowledge of Michaels 80s and early 90s catalogue and not much else. Even so, we enjoyed the show very much, my husband more than me. We were surprised that we actually knew over half the songs used. My biggest complaint was that it was light on the Cirque aspects (in other words they focused a lot more on dancing than on acrobatics).

SPOILER ALERT

One number was just a giant video with no live component at all, which was kind of disappointing since we came to see a live show. It was also heavy on the silhouette/shadow puppet effects that they have been incorporating into more and more Cirques.

And they went a little overboard with the crotch-grabbing - for a show inspired by someone who had so much technical dancing prowess, they sure spent a lot of time on a far less difficult dance move than they did on Michaels other, more impressive signature moves. For these few minor complaints, it gets a 4 instead of 5.

We liked the number where the entire floor was bouncy, allowing the ability to incorporate crazy flips into the choreography.

We were impressed by the one-legged mans balancing act and breakdancing. As I am disabled and my husband spent a year and a half on crutches and almost lost a leg due to a bone tumor, we always welcome representation and diversity of this kind. He was seamlessly integrated into the show and no big deal was made of his differently-abled status or his crutches - he was treated like just another cast member and the crutches were treated like just another set of props. And he was just as technically able as the rest of the troupe. Most people cant move that well on crutches even after 6 months or more. Or without crutches and two good legs, for that matter.

And as music people we appreciated that the live female guitarist they had was very technically skilled.

Like at other Cirques, the ushers all wore related costumes, though in this case it felt a little more strange than usual because it meant that there were dozens of Michael Jacksons running around all over the theater. At, say, Ka, they just look like other people from that world, rather than the same person over and over.

Having been to many Cirque performances, I recognized instantly that the four audience members horsing around in the aisle with very bright and distinct outfits on (one of whose was reminiscent of Ash/Satoshi from Pokemons outfit) were not just the rowdy audience members they seemed to be. Cirques signature move of having a plant (audience member who is actually part of the show) was expanded to a gang of four friends who travel through a very strange world after one of them steals the glove, which turns out to have a life of its own a la Thing and Mickey Mouse. This throughline wasnt as strong as it was in say O, but thats okay.

Most of the music was just remixes of Michaels originals without much change to it, which as a purist I appreciated. Though I loved their version of I Just Cant Stop Loving You, which they turned into a duet between Michael and one of the Cirque performers. If only this were available on a CD in the shop.

Another minor nitpick is that I didnt like the tabloid covers with audience members photos on them that were showing on the screens while people were being seated before the show began. The jokey headlines were cheesy and the pairing of them with the photos was completely automated - there was no curating to make sure that the peoples faces werent covered up by headlines or that the person matched the headline. That 8-year-old boy on the squirrel saves woman cover - is he the squirrel or the woman?

If you only see one Cirque, this shouldnt be it*, but it was still enjoyable and entertaining. There are no bad seats in the house due to generous stadium-style spacing between the rows, so dont be afraid to go for the cheap seats if youre hesitant about spending $175+ each on tickets.

*If you only see one Cirque, make it Kurios, Zarkana, Ka, or Mystere (listed in order from best to less best).

[NOTE: I posted this review recently but I wrote it when Zarkana was still playing. Unfortunately it has since closed.]"
MJ One,It makes a huge difference when people love their job. Every staff I encountered with helped me and if they didnt know they would seek the answer for me. The energy of the show is an addiction. It makes you want to stand up and dance! Good for all ages. With any Cirque production I always feel its better sitting away from the stage this way you can make sure you catch it all.
MJ One,"My first Cirque du Soleil show and it will not be my last.  There is no way I can put this show into words.  The music stretches through decades of his music.  The acrobatics, the lights, and a Michael Jackson hologram that dances with the cast of the show.

The show...
Each starring cast member gets a different power from either Michaels glasses, gloves, shoes, and jacket.  The show is insane with people rappelling down the walls and monsters dancing in the aisles.  The costumes are bright and at one point it went completely dark and light up suits that outlined dancers lit up the stage as they danced to Billy Jean.  Thriller was probably the best!

We had to pay for parking, which was new because parking use to be free."
MJ One,I was absolutely blown away. Every aspect of this show was magical. It was complete and utter perfection. I was entertained 100% of the time. Music was great! Special effects were so neat. I highly recommend this show!
MJ One,"Just saw this show. Not what I expected, but I guess I had no idea what to expect.  There were good acts, but there were some weird things about the show that I didnt care for. Theres a futuristic type feel to the show, however, they also go back in history.  There were some parts that are memorable, but I dont think its a show that I would opt to see again.  I was said because the show didnt do MJ justice, but it was a good tribute to his life and his work.  Also, the show could be overwhelming because of all of the different parts taking throughout the show and within the audience.  Overall, it was a good show and I wouldnt mind seeing it again."
MJ One,"What an awesome show! The sound system, the lights, the effects, the dancers and performers, and Michaels music and the legacy he left for everyone. 

I bought tickets for my wife and I, as weve been talking about wanting to go see this show since it was first introduced. We have seen all of the Cirque shows and Le Reve at the Wynn. In my opinion, One is a great show for fans of Michael and his music, and even if youre not a fan the show is immensely enjoyable. When we saw Love, we had a similar experience, but the music didnt touch our souls or reflect in our memories as much as Michaels, which further impacted our experience during this show. 

Its a great show, well worth seeing! Id go again."
MJ One,"What a show!!! Fanoninal. We came 15 minutes late so now I have a good reason to go again. 
It cant get better. A night that started with dinner at joel robuchons Latelier, continued with this great show and ended at the Hakkasan with a reserved table next to the DJ.
I wish myself more nights like that one"
MJ One,Garbage. I have seen 8 other Cirque du Soleil shows and this was by far the worst. Wheres the imagination and timing? Not recommended.
MJ One,"Ive seen a few Michael Jackson tribute shows and have been mildly entertained by them and in some cases left my head shaking.  Michael Jackson ONE blows them all away!  After a few mediocre shows on the Strip (BeLIEve, Viva Elvis, Zarkana), this is Cirque du Soliels comeback to brilliance.

Whether or not youre a fan of Michael Jackson, Im pretty sure youll be thoroughly entertained.  Its not like a pure Cirque du Soleil production like KA, Mystere, or O, but its more in the realm of a tribute show like LOVE was for the Beatles, where the focus is mainly on the music, choreography, and vision inspired my Michael Jackson.

A few highlights of note:

- Make sure you make it to your seat before curtain call so you can get to see some of the pre-show activities.

-The music has been totally remastered in which the instrumentation sounds brand new and follows the dance routines very well.  Like the LOVE theater, the seats have front and rear speakers to totally immerse you into the show.

- The choreography is very well done!  You actually start cheering on the dancers when you see many of MJs signature moves and routines.

- The stage is pretty awesome with wall-to-wall projections along with some 3D holograms. --  http://bit.ly/1oXQifY

I can go on and on about ONE, but Id be giving away too much.  Right now, this IS my favorite Vegas CdS show.  It blew my mind!  And it also got me a little misty-eyed simply because this is probably the closest thing Ill ever get to a Michael Jackson live performance.  And like what other Vegas shows like Beatles LOVE and Elton Johns Red Piano, it rekindled my interest in Michael Jacksons music and had me listening to his songs weeks later!  I would definitely see ONE again for sure!"
MJ One,"I didnt want to go, but my mom made me.  And now Ive been back many times since.  Ive seen 4 of the Cirques but this is hands down my favorite.  I get emotional every time I see this show.  They did such a great job of pulling emotion out and making it extremely entertaining to everyone even non michael jackson fans.  I wont give away anything about the show but I will say the tickets are pricey but TOTALLY worth it.  This is the only show in vegas that I keep coming back to."
MJ One,Amazing!!!  This show is pure entertainment that you never want to see end. The performers are ridiculously talented.  The technical aspect is jaw dropping. You will be on your seat the entire time.  The music is fantastic capturing all the hits. Bravo!!!
MJ One,"Amazing show, amazing energy, loved it! 

If Michaels music and dancing is your thing, its a must see. If youre not really into that, you probably wont enjoy the show."
MJ One,"We wish that we could publish a photo of the show here on Yelp, but no photography allowed! And once you see the show youll know why; talk about an overload of talent, excitement, sexy and Michael Jackson. 

We are 1000% confident that MJ himself would be a fan of the show and fully approve.

Go ahead and spend that extra few bucks to get closer to the stage, its worth it! 

We think Cirque du Soleil got this one totally right!"
MJ One,Awesome show. There really isnt a bad seat in the house. The hardest part of the show is trying to figure out what to focus on during the show. Well worth every penny and I definitely want to see the show ago. A must do for anyone visiting Vegas!
MJ One,"Ive seen shows like Le Reve, Zumanity. Zarkana but this one was one of my favorites so far. We usually buy show tickets as Tix 4 Tonight but this show was not discounted so we went to the box office. It was totally worth it. I laughed, cried and was blown away by this show. BIG SHOUT OUT to Miya our seat hostess who was so amazing and went above and beyond! 

The only bad part was the constant flashlight flashing in my eyes because people do not understand the concept of no recording."
MJ One,"My husband and I went on 8/21/2017 to see this show.  We bought great seats in the middle of the first row of the balcony.  First, we left after 25 minutes, so maybe the show changed a lot for the last half.  I have seen a lot of cirque edu soleil shows and loved them, but this one was lacking in talent or production value.  They purposely have the show sort of in  filtered light so things dont appear clear.  Then they periodically shine a bright light in the audiences eyes.  It was incredibly loud and I didnt experience one moment of wow.  Except the negative wow, how can this be so bad?  I didnt expect the moves to be in the same amazing category as Michael Jacksons incredible talent, but I still thought it would be so much better than it was."
MJ One,"BIG FAN OF MICHAEL JACKSON !
As someone who was a big Michael Jackson fan , I enjoyed the show .
I cant give 5 stars , because I didnt care for the storyline or the choreography and  there are just few acrobatic moves . 
But the music , the holographic effects and the shadow act was soooo good ! 
Overall, very enjoyable !"
MJ One,"During the whole show, i had goosebumps over and over.

Even though I did not know much about Michael Jackson, I could get to know how great he was at music, what he cared about, and his passion.

All the performers were professional and exactly knew what they were doing.

I loved the show."
MJ One,"Yes!  This is the church of Michael Jackson.  For the fourth (4th) time I enjoyed; the lights, sound, acrobatics, theme, and music of the most fabulous entertainer in history. This show captures the fun, creativity and magic of MJs spirit.  

Note, for people who dont get it.  The hat, glove, shoes and glasses give the 4 misfits the power to overcome! Keep that in mind when you watch it.  

I can say that the best seats are on the isles in the last rows on the lower level or as close to that last row as you can get.  I had section 103, Row R, Seat 1. 

OMG such an amazing show.  I wish that I could watch it every day after work....Ive seen it twice with others, and twice by myself now.  This show will be on my itinerary for any future visit to Vegas until the show closes.  Its that good..."
MJ One,"I was 6 yrs old when my parents bought me my first vinyl Thriller. If youre a fan of Michael Jacksons most memorable hits, then this show is for you! They played Cant stop loving you, Beat It, Thriller, Smooth Criminal, Scream, and many more. The chasing the glove part was not necessary as I was completely entertained thru out the entire show. My 6 and 5yr old enjoyed the characters running around and acting silly because they had no idea who Michael Jackson was! 
Seats are great wherever you sit in section 102. There were speakers in the head rest which was very loud. Ushers brought over extra cushions for the children for better viewing.. (I didnt even ask for this!!) but a great plus! Pyro tech people did an awesome job! The light show from Beat it was superb! 
Paid $900 for 4 tickets in Section 102 row D. 
We enjoyed popcorn and 2 Sprites for 25 bucks. 
I chose to withdraw 1 star for lack of tricks. Yes there  were a few acrobats from the ceiling, guys balanced on a rope, 1 guy danced with only 1 leg, but it was still lacking that bag of tricks at the end for a grand finale! Well done Vegas, yes I would see it again! I cried, laughed, said wow a few times, and left feeling like Michael Jackson actually meant something to my childhood."
MJ One,"You really have to like MJ to like this show. They even played two songs that I had never heard of which was a strange decision. Not sure why this show is so popular. The Cirque aspects are only present right in the beginning, unless you count the dumb trampoline part of the show. Most of the show was like a live music video with MJs songs playing and lights dimming and dancers doing the same synched moves. There were also alot of people swinging from ropes coming from the ceiling. The show was underwhelming, boring at most points and very dated. You better like MJ alot and you also have to laugh at the part where McCauley Caulkin (aka his first victim) shows up on screen. 
   
   Oh and you can sit in the last row and see perfectly fine. Dont waste anymore cash than necessary. And why was that one legged dancer in the show and the guitarist with lion mane hair was very lame."
MJ One,Excellent show! Definitely a must see if coming to Vegas. A lot of people say this is currently the best show in Vegas and I would have to agree. I only deducted a star because I did expect a bit more of the cirque theatrics but that did not take away from the show at all. I also think any seat is a great view because we were in the back and were still able to enjoy the show and see all that was going on. The MJ hologram at the end almost made me shed a tear!
MJ One,"4.5 star review that leans 5 stars. This show was awesome. Im an alltime MJ fan and got a lil emotional a few times missing my favorite artist. They honored him well and theres a few surprises that will leave a smile on your face. Of course the music is excellent, the concepts were spectacular, and the performers were of the highest quality and professionalism (youll soon read just how professional)

What keeps this show from being a 5 star is something that has nothing to do with the actual show or staff but the odd number of people who kept getting up to leave during key moments of the show. In our row alone we had to stand up and let 3 different individuals out and then to come back so our experience was interrupted 6 different times again from just our row. This does not include the half dozen ppl who arrived late all the way up to 45 mins into the show which meant ushers had to use flashlights to find their seats. IDK if this sounds pickey but I assure you we are not pickey ppl and this does not include (no exaggeration) 12-15 ppl we noticed leaving in other rows (1 other lady in a row in front of us I counted got up and came back 3 different times by herself) thing is we sat really close so I can imagine how distracting it was to ppl who sat further back we heard several groans. All of this going on and no hiccups in the performers ability to put on an awesome show was a pleasure to watch. Id like to see this show again but itd have to be really close to the stage to prevent the distractions but those tickets are kinda pricey"
MJ One,"it is amazing show in Las Vegas!! They are all extremely talented!!!
My teenage kids love this show!! They really enjoyed this whole show."
MJ One,"Magic.   Absolute Magic.  
Not sure what show those other Yelpers saw but tonite the entire venue gave a standing ovation.  Guess everyone has an opinion no matter how wrong they are!"
MJ One,"It was ok but didnt knock my socks off like other shows. I was kind of disappointed. Some of the special effects were really amazing but over all the show just wasnt that good. 
Actually, I enjoyed the Michael Jackson movie much more."
MJ One,Simply the best show Ive seen in Vegas!  It was truly a great tribute to MJ.  Just a stunning show. Highlight of our trip.
MJ One,"By far the best Cirque De Solei production show I have ever seen. Not only am I a Cirque fan, Im a huge Michael Jackson fan so my expectations were pretty high. My husband and I enjoyed it from the beginning to the last. 

The last piece was my favorite part, It was amazing, I wanted to cry. 

Michael Jacksons The One was a standing ovation. I would love to see it again because there were so many things going on at the same time, I didnt know where to look. Gah! I loved it so much."
MJ One,"This Show Must Be On Your Bucket List.
Of all the Vegas Shows (include cirque shows) Ive seen - This was The Best Ever!
The Light, Performers, and 4D Effects are Truly, Truly Amazing!"
MJ One,"i would like to split my rating....
5 stars just for the music, the nostalgia associated with the music, and the dancing numbers.  spectacular.  if you are an mj fan... this show is for you. highly recommend.  most seats are good so dont overspend
4 stars for some of the acts/numbers being kinda slow.. 
we are in vegas... we wants non stop entertaingment... other than that i would imagine that a 4.5 star rating is in order
enjoy"
MJ One,"Great show!!!! Slow start, but ended up being amazing!!! It was worth every penny! Please check this show out! We had a blast! We will be checking out other shows when we return! Thanks for a great show Cirque du soleil!"
MJ One,"Great show! Great performance! Lovely performers, great music! Visuals! Acrobatics!

Highly recommended!"
MJ One,"Wonderful show, good for all ages, best of Michaels music with the right nod to all the moments that made the music videos our favorites.  Music and dancers were enough to make the show, Cirque performance put the show over the top.  Think I liked it?"
MJ One,"LOVED this show! If you are a Michael Jackson fan or just love his music, it is a must see! Ive been to several Cirque Du Soleil Shows in Las Vegas and this is definitely in my top 3."
MJ One,"After seeing Love for three years in a row we thought it was time to venture out.  Everyone was saying that the MJ One show was phenomenal however I just dont see that.  The prices were extremely pricey.  I expected for the seats not only a great view but great sound but oh my goodness it was loud and screeching!  You could feel it through your body and my ears actually hurt after. When it gets that loud it crosses the the line of music to just noise.  This is not a true cirque du soleil show, this was more dancing.   The dancers were good but the choreography was not as good as I thought it should be.  The story line is just a mess and none of us could figure out what the meaning was.   I do like MJ and there were a couple of good dances but for the price I expected the level of Love... it wasnt."
MJ One,"This is THE BEST Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. Phenomenal evening of entertainment, athletic ability, music, and beauty. Truely magical. 

I have seen them all- Ka, O, Le Reve, etc... this knocks them all out of the park. 

Cant stop dancing. :)"
MJ One,We went to this show for my  mothers birthday  and  my husband fathers day. This show is amazing. From the beginning to the end. I highly recommend this place . I will return.  I cant wait. #loveit
MJ One,"Boom, best show Ive seen in Vegas. It was incredible with music, dance, and cirque performances. This ones a bit more pricey but worth it. If you have time for just one show do this one!"
MJ One,"Huge Michael Jackson fan and got a seat 8th from the front in center. Tickets were nearly $200 per person, but I really enjoyed the performance. The acrobatics and stunts by the cast were amazing and so were the effects. There was one part where a skinny guy wearing a black hat did pop and lock solo which Ive seen better guys at the club do, presumably to give the cast time to rest and set up for the next performance. Outside of that, I greatly enjoyed the performance and it was well done.

Looking forward to watching other Cirque du Soleil performances. This one was really good."
MJ One,"My nephew wanted to see this show and boy oh boy Im glad he did as it is a five star all the way show.  

Right from the start, it is non stop action.  The changing of the stage, to the awesome sound ( there is speakers right in the rear of the headrest to give it another level ) system, to acrobatic and dance performers is great.  

We got to hear songs when MJ was just a kid.  I guess he really never did grow up and that is what made him special.  If he were alive to see this show, I think he would be happy.  

I still feel excited just thinking about the show and I wont go into details as I would want you all to be surprised.  

The show is called ONE as it is the one to see for sure!"
MJ One,"Before getting to the show, I have to acknowledge the rock star manager at the box office who handled my crisis yesterday.  My flight from Phoenix delayed by FIVE HOURS and it became evident there was no way I was going to make it in time for the 7 p.m. show.  The moment I landed in Vegas, I called the box office and the manager kindly offered to exchange the tickets for the 9:30 show.  The seats available werent as good as our original seats (purchased months ago) but I was in no position to complain.  Thank you, thank you for saving the day (and my birthday!).  

The first 30 minutes were a lot of flash and splash (figuratively) but nothing terribly impressive.  However, it picked up.  Its a little more dancing to MJ songs than an actual story (although there a story but its easy to miss) and Im okay with that.    

The pole dancer in the Dirty Diana number was incredible.  If strip clubs boasted dancers like that, Id be a lot more interested in going.  

The wire suits were phenomenally done.  

Theres an MJ hologram at one point and its kind of neat but marginally creepy.

The trampoline section was really cool and Ive seen nothing like it.  

I didnt understand the point of the chick with the Quiet Riot hair and the fake guitar.  She didnt really seem to fit in with any of it.  
 
Great dancing, great costumes and great visuals.  

All in all, a lovely show.  If youre an MJ fan, dont miss this!"
MJ One,"Amazing, amazing, amazing-from start to finish. There was so much energy in the room and all the performances were great! 

I loved the interaction with the audience. Sometimes, it felt like MJ was really there(watch and youll see what I mean). I loved the symbolism in the show as well. All the dancers were great and different.

When going to Vegas, this show should be a must!

If you think the show is BAD, then BEAT IT!"
MJ One,"This show was phenomenal!!!! Worth every dollar that we spent on it! And this is a rare thing, but- I would totally see it again!!! 

The cast was very large, with dancers and cirque performers.
 When you are choosing seats, sit back quite a bit from the stage, to get the full effect of the performers coming down from the ceiling and side stages several times throughout the show. For me, the best part was the hologram...although I find that technology a bit creepy, I was never able to see MJ in concert before his passing, so it actually brought me to tear up a bit. It was truly beautifully done."
MJ One,"I want to say this is my favourite Cirque show, but they are all amazing!

If you are a Michael Jackson fan this is something you have to check out. This show really brings out the life that he had and the musical performance will send your body into chills. 

Keep your eyes open, cause the performance is literally all around the audience so you dont want to even blink!"
MJ One,"Starts off pretty cheesy and slow.  The first 20 minutes I was thinking, this is pretty terrible, especially for a Cirque production!  Buuuut I stayed and it got pretty dang good.  Id even say top 3 in the Cirque line up."
MJ One,"MJ: the king of pop. What an amazing experience. This cirque show was breath taking, exciting, innovative... I didnt want it to end!! 

After contemplating on seat location/prices online (we had 6 in out party), we ended up choosing section 103 which is lower level on the right side of the stage. We were 4 rows from the stage, and these tickets were the same price as farthest section back in the center, which I thought was weird. Regardless, dont be afraid to sit on the side, it was amazing. 

There was acrobatics, light shows, amazing choreography and costumes, and there was a story line which I thought was fun and creative. The characters were present throughout, and I liked how they switched it every song to avoid predictability. 

My favorite part was the trampoline act, the Man in the Mirror, the shadows, and the MJ dancer. You truly just have to see it to believe it. It is incredible!!"
MJ One,This show was way too loud. I have to cover my ears with hands and my heart got shaken so much. I left after 15 mins.
MJ One,Great show. I saw the Immortal touring show and this was just as good. The music was wonderful and the Michael hologram was a nice touch.
MJ One,Best show on the strip by far! Ive watched it twice with front row seats and I love the energy from watching the performers they really make you feel like Michael is right in front of your face!
MJ One,"I absolutely loved this show! If you love Mj this is definitely the show for you! There wasnt a part of the show I didnt even enjoy, even during stage set up the performance was great!"
MJ One,"Amazing! amazing!amazing!!! I wasnt a fan of Michael Jackson, but now I wish I have gone to his concert when he was alive!  If you only like his music just a little, go and see it! The cast is amazing with MJs dance moves and the acrobatic performance! The cast gets to dance with MJ at the end of the show!"
MJ One,"I went to the show when it first opened. I really wasnt sure what to expect, my Girlfriend never had seen a Cirque show. 

I keep seeing people complain that this isnt like the other Cirque shows. 
For those of you wanting a traditional Cirque de Soleil show, this isnt it. 

There isnt the same feel as the other shows, but its pretty fantastic. There is a story to follow, fantastic dancing, music and so much more.

I think its such a fresh new way to put together a show, its a must see if you are in town. I do think they borrowed a few concepts from some AGT acts, but its still pretty cool.

Get there early because there are some things to see before the show.

I hope this helps."
MJ One,"I had very high expectations for this show, as it is seems to be the hottest show in Vegas right now. The theater is very clean and comfortable. Security measures are enhanced following the recent tragedy at Mandalay Bay. The show itself started off rather subdued. For the first 40 minutes, we were underwhelmed; however, it did start improving and, for the last 30 minutes, it was excellent. Thereafter, the choreography was terrific, the use of lights and technology was outstanding. We were seated in the middle rear section, which was not the best, but it was what was available. If you are going to see this show, I think its worth it to book early and get premium seating. Overall, it was a good show, but I liked Beatles Love better."
MJ One,"I cant begin to express how much I loved this show.

I have seen almost every Cirque Du Soleil show in Vegas and I am a Michael Jackson fan.

I was thinking I would like it if it plays his music, BUT they way outdid my expectations.

Every scene felt like ok Im happy now, but they outdid it every time.

They nailed Thriller and Smooth Criminal!

I definitely have to watch this show one more time.

-- Spoiler Alert --
The show plays ALL of Michael Jacksons hits with parts of his music video playing in the background while dancers try their best. 
There is a part where snow comes down for a while
There is a guitarist solo every now and then like MJs live shows
There is a shadow show using Michael Jackson projection and actor shadows (its really good)
There is a part where all goes dark and all you see are LEDs on the dancers (VERY COOL) 
There is an asian girl beating up virtual speakers?? (dont ask)
There is a super strong pole dancer (Watch the end when she goes up, shes not human)
Hologram MJ!  Thats all.. 
At the end, they try to get the audience involved and dancing"
MJ One,This was awesome!!  The reason it didnt get 5 stars is because it was SO LOUD that I could barely enjoy it.  Bring or ask for ear plugs!
MJ One,"I love MJ and I love this show.  It feels like that they have brought MJ back to life!  Just awesome, and totally worth the price tag."
MJ One,"Ive seen this show twice in 10 months. Its that good! The first time, we had 3rd row seats and we ended up with neck pain and we kept missing performers dangling from the ceiling a few rows back. The second time we were in row R which was perfect - we saw everything. Jamone! Hee hee! They made a few minor changes since the first time Ive seen One.

Ive also seen Michael Jackson Immortal which is a bit similar but not really. Some songs were the same - of course his biggest hits were in both shows. Im an MJ fan before he became white.

Im gonna make a change for once in my life. I might have to edit/update all my Cirque du Soleil reviews. Ive seen Ka, Zumanity, Beatles LOVE, O, Zarkana, etc. and Ive ranked them in a previous review. This is now my 2nd favorite CdS show...LOVE is still my fave.

The way you make me feel. You really turn me on. Lights, music, costume, set, illusion/ visual effects, choreography, acrobatics and snow  (Stranger in Moscow). This show has it all. Compared to all CdS shows, this has more dancing/ choreography than acrobatics. I hate to say its mind-blowing...that sounds painful!

Highlights of the show include Dirty Diana(...girl with abs - HOOOO!!!), Human Nature, Billie Jean, Thriller, They Dont Care About Us and Black or White. The MJ hologram was incredible.

Beat it beat it beat it! Just beat it!...if you dont like MJ or this show. Because Michael, I just cant stop loving you. Youll be dancing (or at least tapping your foot, snapping your fingers and bobbing your head) and singing while watching the show.  I guess the only thing Im not too happy about was that Ben was not included in the show...thats one of my faves but its a sad song and probably would not fit anywhere in the show."
MJ One,"Wow. What can I say? Amazing experience! If you think you are coming here to watch a cheap impersonator of MJ, and maybe hear a few of his songs, youre wrong. This was incredible, and truly a journey of his life, and the message he had for the world. This was deep, and meaningful. It touches your heart. They cover every aspect and part of his life through the years. I dont want to give away too much, but this was worth every penny. The people performing were awesome and did the ultimate tribute to Michael Jacksons life that if he were alive today, I think he would be proud. If you ever listened to his music and just grooved to it without giving too much thought to what the song was about, this show will give you the realization of everything MJ spent his life trying to tell us, and the change he was trying to make within us for the betterment of humanity. After decades of listening to his music, tonight I finally got it. THANK you Mandalay and cirque de soleil. I feel truly honored to have experienced this."
MJ One,"This was a great show.  The music, the acrobats, the presentation were all excellent.  You cant really compare it to your standard Cirque du Soleil shows except for Beatles Love.  If you enjoy MJs music at all, then you should enjoy this show.

Overall, it was a nice trip down memory lane and thinking back to when some of the songs were released. 

Before the show, you can buy one of the specialty drinks sold at the bar.  I ordered the large Zombie.  Yikes that had a lot of rum.  It was delicious though.  Shamone!"
MJ One,"Ive seen several of the Cirque du Soleil Shows and I have to say this one to date takes the cake! Awesome show totally loved it if youre a MJ Fan youll defiantly love this show! The only thing that I didnt like and nothing to do with show or the performance was the people sitting next to us they were yelling and screaming throughout the whole show (Go Girl, Hell Yeah, Oooh Yeah Baby) and I couldnt enjoy it as much as I would have loved too because of that but oh well! Either way great show just wish I couldve not had the extra sound effects!"
MJ One,Excellent show. I would see it again. Favorite act is the guitarist! Love her style and performance. If in Vegas it is a must see.
MJ One,"Amazing cirque du soleil show. I am not a huge fan but I do like Michael Jacksons songs. This show is filled with excitement from beginning to end. The laser, music, stage settings, pyrotechnics all combined to provide an absolute fun event. We had literally the worst seats in the house at the too right corner but I still enjoyed the show so much. Probably my favorite cirque show by far."
MJ One,"One of the best shows I have ever seen! I was entertained throughout the entire show and I found a new appreciation for Michael Jackson! 

It is definitely worth every penny!"
MJ One,"The Best!
I did not have the opportunity to watch Michael Jackson Live. The show is so good; you feel like he is there. 
Michael Jackson was very important in my life (yes I am a TRUE fan), so I had high expectations for this event. It met my expectations. Impeccable performances, with superior dancers. The show is full of surprises and if you are a Michael Jackson fan, this show will make you teary eyed. I appreciate that they left Michaels performance intact and did not alter or modernize the MJ concept. I recommend this show. I will go again. It was a magical experience"
MJ One,"Heres what I shared with Cirque admin, lets see how they respond:
Our group of 12 attended the show on Saturday, Jan 28th. I am writing you as a dissatisfied customer. One of our group has epilepsy, and we clearly understood the disclaimer on the ticket that strobe lights will be used DURING the show, and she was willing to attend in that she had the choice to control the environment by closing her eyes if need be. What we did not expect is a BARRAGE of your talent with HIGH intensity strobes to attack us upon entering the theater, and after repeatedly pleading with them to STOP, STOP, and get out of her face....they kept getting closer. I realize this may have been confusing for them in that we were playing along, but trust me we were not. I finally needed to push her out of the way and physically get in front of her to explain to them why that was not acceptable to keep going when we clearly said STOP. I also talked to an usher, but realize they are most likely not empowered to make a chance. Hence, I am writing you with this information. 

I feel you may need to address your pre-show activities with your staff. Although we ended up staying because we paid over $300 for these 2 tickets and were with a group of co-workers, I assure you the rest of the show was ruined by this 30 second situation. The only reason we didnt walk out and eat the $300 was because we were there with clients we took to the show. 

I will NEVER recommend this show to anyone not only based on this experience, but also because it was a merely a glorified MJ impersonator with horrible loud acoustics and barely the usual talent of other Cirque shows weve seen. We went in knowing their was bad reviews about this show, and was underwhelmed by the performance. I realize you are riding the coattails of other more entertaining Cirque shows, but I feel you are doing your patrons a disservice and robbing them worse than the penny slots in LV. I plan on sharing this review on sites such as TripAdvisor so other patrons are clear what they are paying for if they choose to buy tickets for this show.

MJ One,Thiss good show at Mandalay Bay Resort Las Vagus with Michael Jackson song. I really love the show. If you come to visit Las Vagus do not forgot about this show. :)
MJ One,"My husband knows that I love MJS music, so he treated me with tickets to this show. My only complaint is that it ran a little to long. Besides that, the show was amazing. The performers did a great job entertaining the crowd. The souvenir shop is worth checking out too."
MJ One,I dont quite know where to begin. I LOVED THIS SHOW. It was filled with great music by MJ and ph the dancing and wonderfully Cirque de Soleil performances. This is a must see show in Las Vegas. The venue is also beautiful.
MJ One,"MIND BLOWING...THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!  We were deciding between MJ One vs The Beatles Cirque du Soleil. Since my son knew more MJ
Songs we picked MJ One. From start to finish it was an amazing experience bringing me back to my teen age years listening to the King of Pop. Nice blend of dancing and the Cirque performance. Very well choreographed and I never wanted the show to end. I cant wait to go see it again!"
MJ One,I loved every second of this show.  It was fantastic!  We sat in the very first row.  There is so much to see all around.  I loved our seats but I would recommend sitting further back maybe in the middle so you can see everything without having to turn around.  If your a Michael Jackson fan or just love his music you cannot miss this show its totally worth the price paid.  You will not be disappointed.
MJ One,"During our last stay in Vegas, we came to see ONE.  I loved Michael Jackson (the performer) and always loved his music.  Since I had purchased our tickets before the show opened (advance purchase via M Life) we had great seats.

The theater is well designed for a good visual from all angles.  All the seats have speakers directly in the headrest.

All of the music was fantastic.  Of course, its MJ after all!  Some of the cirque acts were excellent (especially the poll dancer with zero body fat of solid woman)!  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is for the dance choreography.  As with most kids who danced and imitated MJ videos for fun or school shows, I know some of the choreography by hart.  I wish they had done it well enough for me not to feel that I could do it better, all these years later.  The dancers were good but if they dont know the moves, its not their fault.

From my understanding, the show is still being tweaked.  Although one thing bothered me about the show, it was still entertaining.  For most of us that loved MJ, it was a bit emotional at some points of the show and everyone stood up to dance at the end of the show.

If you like MJs music, you will enjoy the show."
MJ One,"If you like Michael Jackson youll love this show. Its super entertaining, the music is amazing obviously and the costumes are spectacular. A definite must see."
MJ One,I had so much fun singing his songs! This is a really good show and so worth the ticket price. There was surprise after surprise! I want to bring my kids back to see this one!
MJ One,"I enjoyed this show much more than I anticipated. I loved the music and the fact that they kept it louder and edgier than they could have. I didnt love the attempt at a corny plot with the four kids finding the MJ items. I found that all mildly annoying. Outside of that, the dancing, costumes, music, lighting was all extremely entertaining and impressive. I definitely recommend it, especially over Zumanity."
MJ One,"MUST SEE!!! This show is so fun! This show is splurge worthy for good seats and opt for the aisle if you can because the performers come out into the audience multiple times. I never wanted it to end. It was exactly what a Michael Jackson tribute should be and I think he would of loved it. Its like Captian Eeo cranked up 1,000%. I cannot wait to come back to Vegas and see it again. Id watch this every night if I could."
MJ One,"MJ One is my favorite cirque show in Vegas (with a few surprises to keep you on your toes).  At the age of 12, I was the biggest MJ fan ever (now, Im in my 40s, but I digress).  I remember sitting in front of the television in awe the year he took home 8 grammy awards in a single night - Thriller was the #1 album, Billie Jean was the song of the year.  We have yet to see someone take the world by storm like he did - and this show brought me back. It was if I was that 12 year old girl watching magic appear in front of me once again! A Vegas must-see for all the MJ fans out there!"
MJ One,"The show was ok. Far less acrobatic than most cirque du soleil shows. More dancing than acrobatic moves. It was entertaining enough; but, once was plenty."
MJ One,"One of the best, most entertaining Cirque shows Ive ever seen. I was hyped and dancing in my seat almost the entire time.... especially during Thriller. 

Man in the Mirror was extremely beautiful! I could feel the emotion in the theatre. Im not going to say much because I do not want to ruin it for all of you. All I gotta say is ONE is a must see performance. Youll definitely not fall asleep during this show."
MJ One,"This is the best Cirque show I have ever seen. I have seen it twice already and I would see it again in a heartbeat. Amazing choreography and dance sets. You will be dancing in your seat for sure. When the show is nearing the end, you dont want it to be over. 

Tickets can be expensive because it is a Cirque show but it is well worth it. You will hear all of his hits and watch as his songs are transformed into a performance like you have never seen.

Whether you are a local or visiting Vegas from out of town you should do yourself a favor and see this show at least once. You will be glad you did!"
MJ One,"I rarely get to Vegas shows.  Being a local who works on the strip means I HATE spending any extra time there.  But...when guests are here you want to spend some time with them and the strip is the place.  So Ive seen numerous shows over the years.  MJ one is a large production.  Very well done but has some pretty slow spots.  I got bored with the lame story line and didnt really enjoy the starving children portion.  A little too serious for a Vegas/Cirque show.  More dancing and more beautiful effects is what it needs.  Loved Thriller and Beat it and enjoyed the parts when they danced with a hologram of MJ.  Very cool.  Im glad I didnt pay for the tickets, and I thought KA and Zumanity were way more entertaining."
MJ One,"SHA-FREAKING-MON. Have I gotten old?!! Am I really reviewing a Cirque du Soleil show?! Next up: reviews of community theater performances, and before you know it, my local grocery store. Its a slippery slope my friend.

But this Cirque du Soleil show is absolutely worth reviewing AND SEEING! And to give you an idea of its greatness: what was the last Cirque show that made you tear up? Yeah, NEVER. No one in the history of EVER except the director of a Cirque show seeing his dream come true or a performer that messed up royally has EVER cried at a Cirque show. But I literally teared up 3 times during this. THREE FREAKING TIMES, during Ill Be There, Human Nature, and Man in the Mirror. I might have blinked a couple of extra times during Stranger in Moscow, which paid tribute to his mom, Diana Ross, and Liz Taylor. MAYBE. Hearing the purity of MJs voice as a kid singing Ill Be There was especially emotional. The woman next to me was sobbing. Full on SOBBING. I was ready to turn to her and half comfort her and half tell her get it together woman, youre at a Cirque du Soleil show! Dont judge her...and me.

Mind you, I havent seen a Cirque show in years, but Ive seen several before, including those that used to tour in LA and some of those with residency in Vegas. The last one I saw, which was my standing favorite, was KA. The acrobatic fight scenes, the moving stage, and the fact that I had a record 45% understanding of what the EFF was happening story-wise were the determining factors. I didnt really feel the need to see another one until my mom highly urged me to see this one.

But now, Michael Jackson ONE in the Mandalay Bay is my absolute standing favorite Cirque show. I remember the Elvis one was pure crap and Im not a huge lover of The Beatles (yeah, I know Im crazy blah blah), but I am a huge fan of MJ. The music had a very big part to do with my enjoyment of the show. I was worried they might choose more obscure MJ songs that might fit acrobatics better, but they picked ALL of mine, yours, and EVERYONEs favorites and somehow all the dancing and acrobatics worked well with his music. The other worry was that it would be just one big Dance Moms performance with some hat tricks thrown in, but they kept true to the Cirque brand and threw in all the impressive acrobatics we know n love. And as expected, there WERE hat tricks. Literally, with hats. 

More impressive, I would say I had a record-breaking 90% understanding of the storyline based on MJs life. The order of the music, the remixing of the music, and the choreography to the music were so well done!

My suggestion if possible and cost-permitting, is that you get a seat in the exact middle of the theater on the first level. Not too close, not too far, and in the middle section. I was maybe 8 rows from the front on the right side of the stage and although it was fantastic up close, I was cocking my head around in every direction like the Exorcist trying to make sure I saw everything happening. And I could kinda see and hear some backstage stuff which kinda messed up the mystique of it all. Sitting far enough back and in the middle will allow you to see the ENTIRE picture of everything happening on all parts of the stage and in the air, and will shield you from seeing or hearing any backstage workings. If the middle is booked up, and there is only a choice between being too close or being too far, I would choose being too far so you see everything happening. You cant take photos during the show anyway and there are people on the sidelines who will call your ass out if they see you. 

Oh, and get there a bit early, there are some happenings in the audience even before the show starts! As someone with an Angeleno sensibility, if youre visiting from LA, this is the only Cirque show you need to see in Vegas! Go eat at Libertine in Mandalay Bay before-hand, walk over to the ONE Theater, and enjoy!!"
MJ One,"The Emperor has no clothes.   Really.   This show was full of sound and fury signifying nothing.   He was a genius -- a wounded man-boy who gave us the gift of his music and this production does not do him justice.  Lots of bass and a laser show instead of choreography, continuity and storyline.  

The few bits of true Cirque performances were amazing but far and few between.  Some cool lighted effects.

What was up with the 3 white kids and pigtailed Asian girl?Were those four kids wandering in and out on stage supposed to remind us of The Wiz?  I couldnt figure them out.   And Mr Glitter suit?   Did this really have to be one more white centric appropriation of an icon of Black culture?

Very disappointed."
MJ One,"Im not a huge Cirque fan and I think its because of the Cirque overload we have in Vegas.  Ive seen O, Zumanity, and Love...but have never been too impressed.  Quite frankly, it gets old.

But Michael Jackson ONE is an exhilarating change!  I would see this show over and over again if I could!  My only complaint with the show is that I couldnt run on stage and play like the dancers look like their playing during their performance.  

GO SEE IT!"
MJ One,I was already feeling bummed out because i was missing out on janet jackson concert back home..i had to fly into vegas for a function...so i decided to treat myself to see this show...all i can say is it was AWESOME!!!! One of the best shows ive seen in vegas! The storyline..the performers..dancers...and of course the music!!! All awesome!! I was tryin not to cry when the song ill be there and man in the mirror came on...it was an emotional performance it jus captured me...bravo...i cant wait to come back to vegas and see this show again!!
MJ One,"Awesome awesome show!!

I had a BLAST watching the MJ One show! To be honest, I really didnt know what I was expecting when I got tickets to this show. The BF was super apprehensive thinking it was like a fake MJ performing a show or something. 

If youre expecting a full on Cirque du Soleil show with tricks and flips and what not, dont  expect it from this show. I suggest going to another show like Le Reve or Mystere. The MJ One show is more like a tribute show featuring all of Michael Jacksons top hits with great choreography and a little bit of Cirque performing acts. 

Everything was spectacular. The music, the performance, the tricks, I enjoyed it so much that I was on my feet by the end of the show. I dont want too spoil it too much but the lights on this show are AMAZZZING! Even the jaded BF loved it!

I really liked how they really kept true to MJs choreography, music, and his videos. The show did such a great job of integrating his famous moves and songs into the show that it didnt seem overplayed out. Expect a high energy and really LOUD show!!

If youre a big MJ fan like me, trust me and go watch this show. Youll be moving in your seat while singing along to the songs the entire time! One of the coolest shows Ive seen in Vegas so far!!!"
MJ One,"As all the other reviews state, this is not your typical Cirque show, its more about MJ, his music and his dance routines.  Id say it was more 30% Cirque routines and 70% choreographed routines which were high energy and enjoyable.  Yes, the tickets at $150 in the 6th row balcony were higher than I wanted to spend (Ticketmaster, cant imagine what it would had been at the box office), but it was pretty enjoyable.  

I would not recommend balcony seats because you cant see hologram number very well from the back.  Perhaps back of the main floor would had been better.  

I wont review the show because its all subjective and if grew up seeing MJ live like I did back in the 70s, youll appreciate the show.  

Instead, Ill tell you to not believe you have to be there early before the show starts because even after the lights went down and half hour into the show, the ushers were still seating people which really disrupted the experience.  And be prepared for guys with small bladders leaving their seats in the middle of the 90 minute show constantly throughout the performance.  This is a performing arts show and its a shame the establishment doesnt give it the respect it and the patrons deserves by closing the doors and enforcing polices that make my $300+  experience thoroughly enjoyable."
MJ One,"Wow! Non-stop action from start to finish. Costumes, sets and emerging stages were wheeled out. Performers dangling above the audience and bouncing on hidden trampolines, dancers in trusses, incredible clear sound system, (not killing your eardrums) and creative lighting made the show fly by. Not the greatest soundtrack of MJ hits, but creatively managed with over 40 diminutive and muscular performers sweating it out for 90 minutes. How they do two shows a night is a mystery. Must go through lots of injuries and staff."
MJ One,"Great show!! It does not have lots of acrobatic acts. It mainly focuses on music and dancing.  If you are MJ fan, you will love it. My husband is not a big fan of Michael Jackson but he still enjoyed the show. well...the guy sat next to him felt asleep tho... lol maybe he was too tired?"
MJ One,"Wow, wow, wow....I have been to all kinds of Cirque shows but nothing like this. There isnt a bad seat in the house and the price ($100 a ticket) was well worth it. It is an incredible tribute to MJ and they rock it out. The part of the program where they go dark and light up to Billie Jean is remarkable. It truly is incredible. They interact with the crowd, dancing in the aisles and before the show. 

Man in the Mirror is an incredible part too. I wont spoil it, but you will be amazed at the hologram and how it dances with the performers.

Go see it. If you are a fan you wont be disapointed!"
MJ One,"Being a life long MJ fan, I really had no idea what to expect, I didnt google or read reviews. This show was nothing what I thought it would be. It was a blast!!! And kind of emotional. Really wish I couldve seen  MJ live in concert. This was the next best thing. The use of technology, holograms, costumes &amp; choreography was tight!!! The story line keeps you interested. The characters are believable.

When dancer show up walking on walls with neon costumes &amp; flying from one side of the room to the stage? Wow man!!! Another moment was when a dancer grabbed his crotch and pointed directly at me w/ his lips and finger, eye contact man!!! 

Im pretty sure they save money on clothing. Some dancers shared costumes. White jackets, Left 1/2 &amp; Right 1/2.

I wish I could find the video they had from one of Michaels concerts; Pictures of him fading in and out. He had a glittery jacket on &amp; a curl of hair hanging over his face. It might haven been the Human nature part of the show. Sorry OCD moment.

It would be nice to see an album with this show. I could tell some of the music was mixed or redone. For now a playlist will do.

All in all Id see this show many times over &amp; pay just as much or even more. It was worth every penny. You could even say it was Bad!!!
#RIPMJ"
MJ One,"Awesome, awesome show! When you enter the theatre, a paparazzi takes your photo which you need to keep an eye out for once you are in your seats.

If you are a MJ fan, you will LOOOOVE this show. I grew up listening to him and this was such a surreal experience for me. My favourite performances were Dirty Diana, Billie Jean and Man in the Mirror. It is definitely worth checking out!"
MJ One,"Im not much of an MJ fan so I came in with plenty of doubt that Id enjoy a show that was MJ-themed.  But to my surprised I was thoroughly entertained.  The production on this show is quite impressive and I left feeling thrilled.

Thriller was my favorite piece although there were many times during the show that had me amazed.  The Asian acrobats were on point!

There were times I felt some of the choreographed dancers were a bit sloppy, but overall the show was great and I recommend MJ One to anyone who hasnt seen it.

We sat in Section 102, Row N, and I felt any seat closer to the stage would not get the full effect of the entire show so dont sit close to the stage because you will miss out on so much behind you."
MJ One,"I hardly ever write any reviews due to laziness. That being said.....this review is beyond words...

If anyone puts a 4 star or lower on this show is simply smoking drugs!!! This was THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN. Im not just talking Vegas. Im talking ALL TIME. 

STAFF: Very polite. Very informative. Any questions, they were always available. Theyre also all dressed up in Michael Jackson gear. 

ATMOSPHERE: Before you even go inside for your seats, you can look at some of his memorabilia. Some of his original items he used are on display. 

SHOW: PERFECT! Before the show starts, the staff are walking around taking pictures of you and your loved one, but in a romantic kinda way. Hard to explain. Then right before the show starts. 5 guys in red jackets and sunglasses are going through the crowd with fake cameras and boom sticks, pretending to snap 100s of pictures of you. Theyre pretty much the paparazzi. Kinda funny and it gets u in the mood. They do all of his classic songs from start to finish with crazy costumes and acrobatics. The dancing is on point. Dont wanna spoil it, but there some great things happening throughout the show. They got a standing ovation. Sorry for rambling....just go see the show!"
MJ One,"Wow! Music, Dancing, Singing but most of all, the acrobatics!  We were seated close to the stage and could see everything and it made if more exciting and alive."
MJ One,"It is a cirque du soleil show so I cant blame the gymnasts/acrobats for not being able to perfectly mimic MJs dance moves.  They tried and it looked clunky at best. I understand that being anything close to MJ is a tall order, much less in an acrobatics setting.  And speaking of acrobatics, there was hardly any synergy between the songs and the acrobatic routines.  Once again, just tough to strike the right balance.

I liked the lineup of songs.  It started off with Beat It to kick things off with energy, and proceeded with a string of 12-14 hit songs.  The visual effects and lighting were nice.  I was particularly impressed with their rendition of Billy Jean..the visuals for that were amazing.  Some of the songs had MJs actual video footage projected on the background which brought some sadness/nostalgia.  

When the show ended, I realized that 1, this is a decent show but I yearned for a true Michael Jackson concert which is impossible at this point, and 2. a decent show should not cost as much as $175 per person.  The hit to my wallet is what brings this down another notch.

Vegas shows demand a premium and I was more than glad to pay what I did for the Phantom of the Opera (years ago) and Le Reve.  Michael Jackson One did not feel worth the price of admission.  Just my two cents."
MJ One,"My first Cirque De Soleil show was good. It was 6 of us friends to see the show. We went to the 9:30 pm showing on 03/06/2016. The theater is located in Mandely Bay and they have a gift shop next door. They have lots of picture worthy to pose at and next to before the show.  The show start off slow to me; but, it got better as the show progress. Mix of familiar and unfamiliar music. Not too much acrobatic as I hope for;  but nevertheless, I like the show. It looks more like a concert with a hologram of Michael and his live dancers with a somewhat story line."
MJ One,"I love the Cirque shows and why I wanted to go to this one.
I love Michael Jacksons music as well.  
I would say this is a tribute to him through dance with
a few Cirque routines. (acrobatics and such).
Not so much a Cirque show, much more of a dance show.
Very disappointing."
MJ One,Best cirque show in Vegas.  I loved it so much.  Spend the extra money to get seats in the front because the cast will interact with you. Sad that it had to end.
MJ One,"This was an outstanding show!  Each and every performance was outstanding.  We took my Mom for her 70th birthday.  We chose between this show and Love (the Beatles).  I did not see Love but my sister and Mom did a couple days later and they much preferred this show.  Anyway, the music, the visual effects, the performances - were all fantastic.  

When the show was over I felt so moved.  This is why you come to Vegas - for entertainment that just mows you over and leaves you feeling like a different person."
MJ One,"I have mixed feeling about this show. I truly enjoyed the music and the MJ hologram along with his picture memorabilia. However, being such an iconic person, his show should be more than just dancers. Perhaps having a story line behind it.  What troubles me  the most is that these particular dancers are having way too much credit for simply dancing to such historical person.  
My favorite were thriller and man in the mirror, I feel that they stayed true to his story line."
MJ One,"Amazing!!!! This was seriously one of the best Cirque shows Ive see. Im not a huge MJ fan but I heard good things about the show and I do like his music and the ways its showcased made me LOVE i. It is MJ so its more dancing than Cirque acrobatics but jam packed beginning to end! Amazing visual affects, loved Dirty Diana and sparkly MJ dancer.. acrobatics are still amazing and the hologram was the best! I literally loved every part of show that its hard to quantify the experience other than tell you to see the show! Worth the money.. this and Le Reve are must sees!!!! I was in the first row center which might be too close I would probably go a few rows back to take in whole show."
MJ One,"So surprised by the positive reviews. Have seen Love, O, and Ka, and impressed by all. This show was disjointed, Jacksons songs were mash ups, for the most part, and the darkness of the stage and magnitude of the sound made it hard to enjoy. Really hated the show and I am a Michael Jackson fan."
MJ One,"Awesome! Magical
Dont miss it, it cost us around $160 per person and this was for seats in the back but they upgraded us for free .
Initially you may think its so so but once they do 40% of the show the magic begins!"
MJ One,"This is my fourth time seeing a Cirque du Soleil show in-person (Ive seen several on tv) and initially I thought it would be my last.  The first couple of performances were a bit underwhelming, plus they all seem to be the same acts just with different themes.  If youve seen one CdS show, then youve seen them all.  There is always a juggling act, aerial act, etc., but by the end of the show, it truly felt like an amazing experience.

A few things to mention:

1.  This is not the typical CdS show.  There is more dancing and theatrics and fewer stunts.  The circus aspect is missing. This was a nice departure to me because I think the shows have a routine to them that can be predictable, but if you are looking for a traditional CdS show, youll be disappointed.

2.  I went during the slow season and got ticket for $75 a piece.  We also got there early and were moved up to better seats without having to pay extra.

I dont want to ruin some of the surprises for anyone, but there were a couple of numbers that really were exciting and I think they did a good job of reflecting who MJ was as a performer.  I was surprised by some of the songs they chose to include and others, (such as Thriller), werent really a surprise, but it was still fun to watch.

Id see it again!"
MJ One,"Michael Jacksons catalog speaks for itself, so youre already guaranteed something great from this show. The theatre is attractive, and the framed costume pieces are a nice touch. I did think it appeared larger than its representation on the online seating chart, so be aware when purchasing tickets. 

They insist that you arrive early for a pre-show, but its really just a bunch of trench coat clad actors pretending to be paparazzi, and running around the aisles. Pretty pointless. 

The show honestly started a little slowly for me, which I attribute to a misguided effort to craft a storyline around these kids who jump from the audience to the stage. They absolutely need to get rid of these annoying, gaping  kids (theyre played by people well over the age of 21) reveling in the magic of Michael Jackson. They overreact, over-act, and ruin every scene they appear in. I kept hoping theyd disappear, but no luck! 

There are some really impressive costumes, dancing, and acrobatics throughout the show. I am not a fan of traditional Cirque shows, so I personally wasnt seeking more acrobatic feats, but if that is what youre expecting, you may be a bit disappointed. 

I agree with the previous reviewers who said some of the dance numbers lacked precision. It didnt detract from my enjoyment of the show, but it was definitely noticeable. Some of the sets also fell very flat for me, specifically the one that was overly industrial, and the one featuring hyperbaric chambers and the Elephant Mans bones. Yeah, I remember the rumors, but if youre going to go that far, you might as well add in Bubbles the chimp, too!

The majority of the show appeared flawless, and beautifully performed. Overall, there was a lot of creativity and energy in this production, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and think the majority of attendees would, too."
MJ One,"HOLY GOD what a show!!!!!  Im a huge MJ fan so naturally I liked it better than someone who isnt but its still a good show to go see even if youre not an MJ fan.  Great music, great dancing with the Cirque du Soleil touch.  

I read a review that you will tear up about half way through &amp; sorta took it with a grain of salt but damn.  If youre an MJ fan (both musically &amp; of the man himself), you WILL tear up or in my case have tears streaming down your face!  

The gift shop is isnt standard either.  Great items that will be hard to pass up buying including MJ memorabilia (those are the most expensive in there).  The whole experience is just a lot of fun and a great way to celebrate a magical man who gave us music that touched our hearts &amp; soul"
MJ One,"This show was utterly fantastic. From start to finish, it was just thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended! And now I definitely have a crush on Jean Sok, one of the dancers."
MJ One,"What an awesome show.  The sound was terrific and the dancers so very talented.  Even if youre not a Michael Jackson fan, it is still a must see.  This was my first Cirque de Soleil and I am happy I saw this one."
MJ One,"By Cirque standards this is an okay show. If you have seen any of the other cirque shows in town,  this one will leave you feeling a little ripped off. Its heavy on the music side and very lacking on the acrobatic performances. 
If you want to see a wonderful cirque show,  head over to mirage for LOVE and even save yourself some money."
MJ One,"If MJ was performing live, it probably could have been five stars, but they get a solid four because of the great tribute. I thought I would see some amazing MJ dance moves, but I guess I expected to much for 150 dollars a pop. With that being said I enjoyed the show although a bit loud, the aerobics were amazing, the glove rolling around stage was a cute touch. My favorite part of show was the neon lit suits and dancers up in the air and on sides of walls, pretty cool. The staff was great, the paparazzi was funny, and I love the overall decor. There is a gift shop with all kinds of cute stuff to purchase. I would suggest the 2nd section of the auditorium to sit in, so you can get the entire presentation of the huge stage show. I was four rows from stage and my head was twisting like the exorcist trying to take it all in."
MJ One,"This show was alright, but compared to the other Cirque shows Ive seen, definitely a letdown. An awful lot of it happened on the screens, which was really boring. The dancers were good, and most of the show was a lot like I imagine going to one of his concerts would have been like. But, when I go to a cirque show, I expect larger-than-life acrobatics and performers flying through the air. That was a very small portion of the show, which was disappointing. Several of the songs were done by only one or two performers and were completely boring."
MJ One,"I was soooooo disappointed in this show.  I never had the chance to see Michael Jackson in concert so I was hoping for a Michael Jackson show with some Cirque elements to it.  What I got was the opposite, a Cirque show with some MJ elements to it.  

We had seats on the aisle in the middle of the theater and these 4 weird looking people show up about 10 minutes before the show started.  Something just looked off about them, their clothes, makeup, something just wasnt right.  Then they kept switching seats so then I knew something was up.  Sure enough they tried getting up on stage and they turned out to be part of the show.  Well I could have done without these 4 comedians.  I guess they were the comic relief part of the show but I just found them completely annoying.  

There was a blonde woman that was miming playing guitar for many of the songs but it was obvious she wasnt actually playing.  During Black or White she was walking at one point and didnt even have her hand on the guitar at a part where she should have been playing.

They had some contortionist guy that was doing popping that was pretty cool, putting his hands behind his head and stuff, but then he came out like 3 more times during the show.  We get it, youre a super bendy guy.

There was a hologram type of sequence where it looked like the dancers were dancing with Michael himself.  That part was pretty cool.  I also liked the pole dancer that was dancing to Dirty Diana.  But overall the show was disappointing.  This was my second Cirque show, (KA being the other one), and I still was not impressed.  So far I dont think Cirque shows are worth the ridiculous prices they charge."
MJ One,Great show!!!!! A must see!!! Loved it!!! The music and performances were great! Unbelievable light show added to the quality of the show! Cant wait to see it again!
MJ One,Great show. Music is awesome and performers do an unbelievable good job. It really brings Michael Jacksons legacy to life.  Special effects are cool and it would assume there is not a bad seat in the house. Seating was comfortable.
MJ One,"I LOVE MICHAEL JACKSON. I LOVED THIS SHOW!!!

There are no words to describe how much I loved this show. By far, its my favorite one in Vegas. Perhaps I am biased bc Ive been a fan of his since I heard him sing Ben as a child with the Jackson 5. You can say I am a die-hard fan....I was beyond excited to see this show. 

One pays tribute to MJ. If youre looking for a cirque du soleil show that focuses on incredible acrobatics and athletic maneuvers, this may not be the right show. This is a show that memorializes The King of Pop through his songs, videos, pictures, and trademark dance moves. 

The stage itself is spectacular. There are two huge screens on the side of the main stage that provide better viewing of the stage and videos/pictures. There are a lot of old videos and pictures of MJ that are shared during the show....Very touching. You will be taken on a musical journey of the career of this amazing performer. 

Fave Moments: Ill Be There with pictures of young Michael, Human Nature and Ill Be There medley, Dirty Diana and the pole dancer, Thriller and the bouncing acrobats and dancers. The dancing hologram of Michael and and the illusion of his dancers dancing with him was without a doubt my most fave moment.....tears. 

You dont want to miss this show. Trust Me....Vegas Best."
MJ One,Waiting to get into the show that should start at 9:30. Its 9:36 and the doors have not open. Somebody should have enough respect for well paying to come out and tell us why we have been waiting 45 minutes and the doors havent open.
MJ One,"The BEST Cirque du soleil show in Vegas!!!!!!! I have seen several Cirque du soleil shows. Ive seen O, Ka, their traveling show Delirium, and Le Reve (which is not a cds show but is similar). Out of all of those shows, Cirque du soleil Michael Jackson One is hands down the BEST! The show features most if not all of his greatest hits, including remixed versions and mash-ups. The dancing, plot, digital effects, and acrobatics are like none other! This is a tribute show and it definitely did justice to the late great king of pop! The crowd roared the entire show! The story and sequence of songs moved together seamlessly. I went with my 62 year old parents while in town for a wedding. We all loved it! Everyone in the audience was singing along and swaying in their seats while watching death defying acts on and off stage. It was incredible!!!! MJ would be proud! GO SEE THIS SHOW!"
MJ One,"Best show in Las Vegas! I have seen both shows, the traveling IMMORTAL tour and now ONE. I must confess that immortal is the best show I have ever watched with one coming in second. Truly invigorating and emotional. MJ is and was the king of pop and his presence can be felt through the hearts of the dancers and his legendary music! 
A must see if you are in Las Vegas! We traveled from Denver, CO to see this show and the front row seats were worth every penny spent!!!!
Truly a night to remember"
MJ One,"The best Cirque in Vegas right now.

Fresh. Innovative.

A breath of fresh air compared to the mess that was the Cirque Michael Jackson IMMORTAL world tour.

Sometimes the Cirque shows can get tired after it has been going for a while, but this will make you happy, especially if you are a fan of Michaels music."
MJ One,"If youre in Las Vegas,  a show NOT to miss! Ninety minutes of breath taking actions! Coreography would do Michael proud!"
MJ One,"Amazing tribute to Michael Jackson! The performance was spectacular. In comparison to the other Cirque shows, there is less emphasize on the acrobatics and more on the dancing, but that should be expected considering the contributions that Michael Jackson made to the dancing world. Of course they covered most of his hit songs and famous dance moves. Aside from the expected Thriller, Billie Jean, and Bad, the show also focused on his activism  by including a pretty powerful performance to They Dont Care About Us and Earth Song.  It was a good Cirque show,  but truly an amazing tribute show!"
MJ One,"We loved this show! We were at the show on 01/14/17 at is was pretty awesome. We sat in Row H, Section 102, which were great seats and very close. Great vies of things happening on the side and on stage. This show made me remember and realize what a loss MJ is and how much I missed his music. Weve seen many of the Cirque shows and this one is the least acrobatic, but the dancing and music make up for all of it. One of the numbers uses an MJ hologram and you honestly feel like he is right there. So good."
MJ One,I wish I would of seen this for my first Cirque du Soleil show instead of KA...this changed my whole perception on these Cirque Du Soleil thing. Awesome show!!!!
MJ One,"If you are or are not a MJ fan, you would love this show. Thank god my sister recommended this show. The show isnt about having a corny impersonator. The show is loaded with cool ticks and acrobats over his best hits. I found myself missing him. They do the Mike Jack memories in my head justice. Well worth it, if you are able to attend, attend."
MJ One,"I am not a big MJ Fan, I dont like what he did in his personal life he had some real problems...  Now with that being said, I do think he is a phenomenal entertainer!  THE BEST THERE EVER WAS in regards to entertainment!!  The Michael Jackson One Cirque du Soeil Show is a must see show, the best Cirque show I have seen!! 
LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!  I took my family to see the show and, my 10 and 13 year old boys loved it too!!  My wife who is a big fan and the reason why I bought the tickets loved it and I loved it too..."
MJ One,"Such a cool show. The performers did such a great job. My favorite thing was the upper and lower trampoline and one of the guys would jump on the lower one, flip upside down, and push off the upper trampoline, pushing him back towards the lower one. 

The story seemed straight out of a videogame. Michael Jacksons famous gear (his glove, glasses, hat, and shoes) were super charging these random kids into badass dancing/killing machines. Meanwhile, these paparazzi drones were trying to take them for themselves and send some kind of a conformity message. 

Even the pre-show show was good. I wont spoil anymore than that. You just have to see this show if you go to Vegas."
MJ One,"My husband and I werent fans of the show, unfortunately. The best parts, for me, were when they actually had Michaels image up on the screens dancing and singing. 

Firstly, we had the best available seats, which I wasnt worried about as most cirque shows are in the round, so there really isnt a bad seat in the house. NOT SO! We were in the very back of the theater and off to the side. The actually chairs were cool, as the sound came out from speakers in every individual seat.

The storyline they were going for just didnt work! We spent most of the time trying to figure out what was going on. 

The music was great, of course. You cant go wrong with some MJ!

In reality, there wasnt much cirque-ness about it. It was more dancing and running around the stage than acrobatics and cool things like that. 

Ive been to see the Beatles Love show twice, and I would gladly go to that one again. It was much more impressive."
MJ One,"This particular Cirque show is a story around 4 young adults coming across Michael Jackson memorabilia and are suddenly surrounded by the magic of Michael Jackson. Lots of his music and dancing, along with Cirques special enhancements. It was a great show. I had front row seats and enjoyed every minute. This was the 9th Cirque show Ive seen. It was not my most favorite, but its one of the top ones. Worth every penny to see, especially if you are a fan of his music. One thing to keep in mind, look in all directions, as not all of the show is on stage."
MJ One,"The show was more Cirque du Soleil than Michael Jackson.  There were a few numbers where the entire cast did some dancing and were almost as good as Jackson choreography.  There was also a somewhat morbid scene at the beginning that had a skeleton , and a coffin like box moving around the stage with no apparent purpose except reminding you that he is dead.
The Mike like dancer was good and there was a one legged dancer near the last scenes that was very good, with and without crutches.  There were some songs that I was not familiar with that were good for Cirque type stuff and they did do Thriller, Billie Jean. I did like some dancing done in the dark with the dancers wearing lighted suits.
The Cirque show was excellent and I like watching  the technical parts of the show. I would like more Michael Jackson choreography to show how great it was."
MJ One,"The Michael Jackson One Cirque du Soleil Show is the best show by far that my girlfriend and I have seen! If you like MJ music, then this is a must see show for you! Not a bad seat in the house but better if you sat center stage. Great sound, amazing performers and high energy throughout  keeps you hooked! This is about a two hour show with no intermission at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. My girlfriend enjoyed it very much and kept saying The Best Show Ever throughout the show... this made my entire Las Vegas week knowing that I treated her to a show she truly and greatly enjoyed! I love my woman Dena and I would totally pay to see this show again with her!  

Jose"
MJ One,"I did not like the show. Why? To begin with, the opening set shows a montage of tabloids with false stories; what is the point of this? To show that Michael Jackson was a celebrity which we already know or to diffuse the controversy of his pedophilia? Anyone who comes to the show doesnt care about the accusations.  

Secondly, the attendants were all dressed in these ugly red trenchcoats which made them appear as if they had stepped out of a Spy versus Spy cartoon from Mad Magazine.  Quite frankly, the coat made these athletes look overweight.  I would have dressed the attendants in a white, smart looking Sergeant Pepper type jacket like Michael used to wear.

Thirdly, the music was cacophonous and morose.  There was little of his upbeat songs, and when they were played, they felt compelled to show a video of Michael singing.  I can see that on You Tube.  

Fourthly, the show required a narrative to serve as a context to display the songs.  

Fifthly, I feel that the major hits should pop off the stage and hit you like a load of bricks to demonstrate the impact of his songs.  

Sixthly, there was no wow feature to give you a sense of awe.

To be fair, I walked out before the half-way point.  The director and arranger were convincing me that Michael Jackson was second rate."
MJ One,"MUST SEE! I cant express enough how much I enjoyed this show! Yes, I am a huge Cirque fan, but this has Michael Jackson, so why not?!? So impressed with this show! Worth every cent and your eyes keep moving with all that is going on. With our group of 6, there was a part that we all were moved to tears. All of the people working the show were extremely nice and helpful as well. We are planning another Vegas trip JUST to see this show again."
MJ One,"This is my new favorite show in Vegas. Ive probably seen about a dozen or shows now in Vegas and One is definitely the one Id rush back to see again.

The energy throughout the show is amazing and hearing the King of Pops greatest hits accompanied by some incredible dancing and acrobatics was just a thrill.

Some of the highlights include the light suits in Billie Jean, the trampoline artists, the female guitar player and of course Thriller. But then in one of the closing songs, MJ himself makes a holographic appearance that is so real that youd think he was alive and kicking again.

A must see in Vegas."
MJ One,"Keeping this short but (hopefully) sweet. The best show Ive seen in Vegas - and Ive been to many. This is more musical tribute than true Cirque experience as its not as over the top in tumbling, acrobatics etc but it more than makes up for it in sheer nostalgia and entertainment value. 

You dont have to be an ardent MJ fan to love this show. In fact, Im inclined to believe that the more marginal the fan, the more overwhelming the show is. You simply forget the sheer number of hits he had. The catalog is astounding. 

One tip, dont sit in the front, sit toward the back middle or better, row AA of section 2. So much going on all over you wont have to strain your neck turning around.

Simply amazing."
MJ One,"Just saw the 7pm show.

Pros: Billie Jean, Thriller, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man in the Mirror were all done very well. The number with the best choreography was The Way You Make Me Feel.

Cons: The rest of the show was average to below average. I found myself watching the background videos more than the performers on stage.

The smoke from the show gave me an asthma attack, ughhh...

The bass was too high as was the overall volume.

Unlike the majority of the audience, Ive seen MJ live 3 times, and 2 Cirque shows, so I have something to compare it to. If the show sustained the quality of Billie Jean, Thriller, The Way You Make Me Feel throughout the entire show and the volume and bass were lowered, Id give it a 4-5 stars.


Note:
Pay $50-$75 and you will get you moneys worth. 
Sit way back if you can and bring your ear plugs since the volume is way too loud."
MJ One,"I hate having to rate this show so low but as a fan of Jacksons music and Cirque I felt the combination only worked at best 50% of the time.  There are a few spectacular moments but there arent enough of them.  Most of the big MJ hits are presented and are done justice but too much filler with lesser tracks detract from the experience.  Maybe I missed it but was disappointed at not hearing Another Part of Me.  I dont expect perfection but several performers dropped props and got out of sync while dancing or performing.  I think my biggest complaint is the awfully invasive ushers in the theater who constantly waved around blue led flashlights up and down the isles for a solid 15 minutes while seating late arrivals and who, a few times during the show waved they lights around distracting dozens of people instead of discretely telling a few folks to stop recording.  Just unacceptable distractions for a show this expensive.  Also, for a stage that relys so much on projections to create their sets, I felt the resolution of the images and the brightness of many of them were lacking.  Finally the $15 service charge that Mandalay Bay hits you with even if you purchase your tickets in person at the box office is ridiculous and is not the way to treat customers if you want them to come back."
MJ One,"Wanting to fill our trip with shows/activities during our Vegas trip that would entertain our kids, I suggested the Michael Jackson One show.  Our kids did not know much about Michael Jackson or his music which resulted in reluctance to their enthusiasm for the show.  We purchased tickets for the 12.28 show near the stage thinking they would be the best seats.  The seats provided speakers in the headrest which enhanced the experience for the show.

The show had awesome audio and visual experience.  The visual experience occurred from the stage, ceiling, isles and sides of the stage.  Since so much was going on, it probably would have been better to have been sitting a little further away from the stage to keep the head turning down to a minimum to take everything all in.  Without giving the show away, did I mention that the show had awesome music, acrobatics and visual experience?

This show was well worth the price of the tickets.  Our kids enjoyed the show very much and were not disappointed.  I would love to come back and see the show again, probably sit a little further back.  Awesome show!"
MJ One,"I was not expecting much. Dont get me wrong. I like Vegas shows but Michael Jackson?  In brief, this show was spectacular. It had an edge. The choice of music was strong and well thought.  And it had moments of sadness and recollection.  

The performers were extremely athletic and versatile.  I was thoroughly entertained throughout.  I recommend seats in the lower section but at least 10 rows away from the stage.  Unlike a typical opera or stage musical. There is so much going on.  You need your peripheral vision.  

Pure Vegas entertainment for the entire family.  It is loud so take that into consideration of you have young children."
MJ One,"Absolutely amazing! One of the best shows by Cirque du Soleil -and I have seen them all! All your senses will be awaken. What a wonderful tribute in memory of the one and only Michael Jackson. Excellent choice of mythic songs, unique and original performances with a perfect choreography, special visual effects and sound. Highly recommend it!"
MJ One,"Saw this last night. I was expecting a hybrid Cirque/tribute performance, and I think the show lived up to that very well. Its more in the vein of Love, with much more dancing than your average Cirque show, although I thought it was way better than Love for two main reasons:

1) the dancing is better. Obviously the music of MJ lends itself more to dancing than that of the Beatles, but the choreography was tight and well done (akin to what youd see on ABDC or AGT) and supplemented by props (LED suits, light sticks, hats, etc) where needed. 

2) the gymnastics were better. There was a lot of tumbling throughout the show--see the act list to get an idea, but the highlights were Smooth Criminal and zombies trampolining to Thriller. As a Cirque du Soleil show, this one surpassed Love (which, if you cant tell by now, I thought was lame). 

Its a good way to introduce someone to Cirque, especially if theyre big MJ fans. Myself, I dont worship him as a musical god like some others, but Im still very glad I went. I love urban dance and I love Cirquish athleticism, and this was a good blend of both. 

As for money vs. view, I sat in the cheapest section available. Cirque does a pretty good job making sure no seat gets shafted. There are the usual side characters running around the theatre, so if you insist on seeing them closer up, dont sit in the back sections (otherwise, you dont miss out on much else)."
MJ One,"Definitely go see this show. I cried, I  cheered, and I  danced in my seat. I  would pay top dollar to see it again. Loved it!!!"
MJ One,Tip: the Delano is the closest entrance to the theatre for taxi drop off. If you like MJs music youll enjoy the show. The theatre is not very large and the majority of seats offer a good view.
MJ One,Amazing!!!! Ive seen this show twice and I enjoyed it both times. Im a fan of Michael Jackson but even if youre not I think you will still enjoy the show:) the tickets are a little pricey but the theater is not that big so even if you get the less expensive seats you will be able to see the stage with no problems.
MJ One,"Hiya 

Recently watched this show! Truly amazing...

I personally didnt care too much for the white characters choreography but the evil guys in the red fits were sick; main characters were cool; thriller was my FAVORITE; acrobatics were AMAZING; a little hard to understand the nerd characters transformation; hologram was sick

Overall amazing show

A must see for any MJ fan"
MJ One,"if the tickets were cheaper id give it another star. i just found the storyline incomprehensible and the Cirque du Soleil experience lacking.  the music was great, dancing was great and the hologram was cool.  not worth the price though."
MJ One,"Viewed on 5/26/2014

Let me start off this review with a huge caveat: I am a huge MJ fan, and my expectations are probably way higher than they should be for this show, or anything with Michael Jacksons name.

The show was just OK in my opinion. I understood and appreciated all of the imagery (tabloid junkies, the misfit children etc) but I just did not think the show lived up to the hype. The hologram was just OK as well (Man in the Mirror). It was not the second coming of MJ, as vehemently described by some people. Perhaps the hologram effect was dulled by the fact that I was sitting off center from the stage. Overall, an OK experience. I feel like I just watched an extended version of Michael Jackson: Moonwalker with tons of LEDs and acrobatics. Some good parts of the show were The Billie Jeans (LED dancers) and the Thriller act. I could have done without the hat juggling and the the magic trunk act, although the contortion dancing was excellent during Human Nature. I wouldve simply preferred an updated anthology without the storyline. This show is nowhere near the best show on the strip.

Overall, very underwhelming."
MJ One,"definitely for the MJ fan. i myself liked his music but wasnt obsessed or anything. 2 other guests i went with were on the same boat while my boyfriend could care less. 

well... we all ended up leaving TOTALLY feeling the MJ vibe. from the point you get your ticket to the point you get your souvenir at the gift store, you just keep feeling like hes all around you. you feel like hes still present there with you.

the music is great, the virtually covered all his top songs and little snippets of almost what felt like everything else. the performance was definitely entertaining. lots of stuff going on... my favorite part was when the whole theater went black except for their suits!!!  

the show was about 1.5hrs &amp; was a totally fun show but if youre looking for super crazy acrobatics i think there are a few other cirque shows that are better. this felt almost like a concert/rave. a lot to focus on but entertaining. just not the regular cirque skill that im used to experiencing for the same high price.

definitely for the MJ fan, not so much the cirque show fan"
MJ One,"I took my nephew and niece here on Saturday July 19th.  Ive been to several Cique du Soleil shows and they are all very good but this one was my favorite.  My nephew is a big fan of MJ fan and he thought it was amazing.  Just the halogram of MJ alone through out the show was fantastic.  They played all his greatest hits, as usual with all the Cirque du Soleil shows, the acrobatics were fantastic.  This tribute to MJ is very emotional, we noticed alot of the audience members were in tears.  This is definitely a must see when in Vegas.  Just a side note:  most of these venues are not that big so there are really no bad seats in the house...just buy the cheapest tickets."
MJ One,"Takes entertainment to the next level!!
i sat in first row &amp; could not tell fact from fiction as the grand finale of man in the mirror unfolded!!
My first cirque show glad I went for the best! loved MJ s music combined with the dancing, visuals, acrobats &amp; the stage effects! Mix was perfect! and of course the trench coat papparazis were embarassing &amp; entertaining!! 
Must see for everyone!"
MJ One,"First let me say I came into this show thinking Michaels music with a bunch of dancing; Why the HECK do I want to pay for that? After the show ,I am glad I did.  This performance actually makes me want to go see Beetles Love. Ive been avoiding that show as well for the same reason.  

Also big thank you to the usher that brought me a set of earplugs.  You showed true customer service by paying attention to the audience.  I greatly appreciated it."
MJ One,"Awesome show!! So much fun. I suggest sitting near the front of the second level to get the full affect. Our seats were 6th row, lower level which was an amazing view, but would have liked to have been back a little further to get the full affect of the lightening."
MJ One,The most awesome show if you love music dancing and performance art!!!! This show has it all and it brings you back to when you were young listening to Michael Jackson and the desire to see him live. The show has a ton going on but also has a story to go along with it. The dancers are true pros and extremely talented. I would see it again in a second!!!
MJ One,"I was very excited to go see this show because the preview looked so awesome before it even was at MBH but I ended up being quite disappointed. 

First, what made my experience that much more worse was that there was a lady with big poofy hair that couldnt seem to sit still. She was constantly moving forward, leaning over to talk to her friend, leaning back and forth. And the way the seats were, her hair basically blocked majority of the main stage so I missed a lot of what was going on. 

When the show first started, it reminded me of LOVE in that it seemed like they were ants just running around on stage with no coordination. I dont like shows like that at all. Meaningless. 

Some parts of the show I really enjoyed because the music was awesome and there was actual dance to see. It be better if there was more of the dance part with more of his hit songs. Half of them Ive never heard of (mainly the slow songs). 

The 3 scenes that I remembered from the show that I really liked was 1) at the end with somewhat like a hologram of MJ singing and dancing on stage with the other cirque performers, 2) I think Smooth Criminal song was playing and they were in these all black outfits with colorful lights and 3) I forgot what song was being played but it was behind a screen so all you see were shadows of the performers doing really cool shadow effects. 

We sat on the right side of the room and the speakers were just way too loud. I mean Ive sat in other theaters where I was near the speakers and it wasnt as crazy ear popping loud as this theater. Maybe because its smaller or something, Im not really sure. Although Lion King was in the same theater and I was perfectly fine with the sound. 

All in all, I didnt enjoy this show as much as I thought I would. A bit overrated IMO. I thought the way Elvis was made was much more enjoyable, not to mention, seating was way better."
MJ One,Worst show I have ever seen. Waste of my time and money. $130 a ticket for bad dancing and nothing that resembled Michael!!!  I would love a refund!!!!!
MJ One,Amazing show! We went for a special anniversary weekend and had a blast. We had great time and very impressed with the performers.
MJ One,"Amazing show, no time to even applaud the performers, the show was around 2 hours long, with a wide variety of acrobatics and dances. Highly recommended."
MJ One,"This was my first Cirque show, and if its any indication of what Cirque is all about, you can bet your ass Ill be watching all of them before I die.

Cant say enough incredible things about this show. A remarkable synergy of human performance, artistry, and tech, made even more amazing by incredible music. I cant remember the times I said wow while watching the performers do impossible feats of strength or defy gravity. My words really cannot do justice to this show. Honestly, youve gotta see it to understand.

Its simply amazing."
MJ One,"Greatest thing about this show is that the performers look and act like its the first show theyve ever done.  So much fun for the family and I.

Would highly recommend it."
MJ One,Whether you are an MJ fan or not this show is a must see. The best of all the Cirque shows for sure. Im a diehard MJ fan and this was the best mash up of his songs and dances that  Ive seen. I would see this show every time I come back to Vegas. There are a lot of acrobatics and dancing and one cool pole scene for dirty Diana. Polers everywhere would love the performance. MJ would be proud.
MJ One,"BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN, not kidding. I saw at least 10 different one of a kind talents/shows all wrapped into one long production of awesomeness. I am not the show type but this blew my mind and has me interested in checking out other Cirque shows. 

I literally cant say enough about this show, it is a MUST see, would have paid 5 times the price for the ticket in hindsight. Seriously go!!!"
MJ One,Wow the wife and I saw 7 shows over 9 days and this is by far the best the Beatles would be second then Carrot Top And he was F***ing hilarious Fantasy was Awesome the wife loved it. Blue Man Group was Ok it was my first time felt that I was expecting more I feel I saw the show before and I never seen the show other than tv shows clips or Commercials. O is horrible we thought it would be more acrobatics and not synchronized dancing and swimming with a lot of guys in womens clothes just not in to that. And Mat Franco is by far the worst show in Vegas Thanks America I will never watch that show hint its in his jacket and if Magic doesnt require a jacket then dont have one on its the desert wear a T-shirt
MJ One,"Absolutely Phenomenal. Best cirque I have ever seen. Amazing choreography and special effects. The highlight is a Michael Jackson hologram performing with the Cirque cast that was incredible.  
A must see Cirque!"
MJ One,"I felt a bit ripped off for the following reasons: 1. No one was able to pull off a decent moon walk 2. Asynchronous and unimpressive choreography. Felt like a high school talent show. 3. No MJ. Misleading marketing. Had I known there wont be an MJ I wouldnt have bought the front seats. 4. The stunts seemed out of place and inconsistent with the MJ theme. 5. Chinese character with martial art choreography? Does this really encapsulate MJ?

More importantly, the overall direction of the show seems misplaced. Most of the audience were middle aged people who wanted to experience something remotely magical as if MJ was there performing in front of them. Instead we get a bunch of high schoolers dancing to MJ music with a bare resemblance of MJs classic moves. Speaking of dance moves, I expected something similar to Youtube dance covers by amateurs- not as perfect as the real thing but something that most would consider impressive. However, in terms of choreography I would rate the performance above high school talent show and below Youtubers.  Then again, my expectation was something near Jabbawockeez in respect to precision and coordination. Lastly, all the technology they implemented were unoriginal and were  better executed by other performers in the industry.

As a die hard fan of MJ for 18+ years, this was a huge let down and tarnishes Michaels name. The aquarium at the Mandalay Bay was far more worth the money."
MJ One,"As good a show as it is over-rated.  Three stars on YELP = A-OK, and so I give ONE a 3.5.  And I had optimal center seats about ten rows back.

This show is tricky to review, so bullet points --

1.  Its not much of a Cirque.  But neither is Beatles LOVE.  And thats fine by me.  Its a Cirque Musical Production, similar to the late Elvis show but far more cohesive.  Beatles LOVE does this genre best -- and ONE is a distant second.

2.  Im a fan of Jacksons best music but not much of a fan of the personality.  The people who are raving here are likely fans of both, as in, anything with Michael on it or in it or even near it is AWESOME.  Me?  Its the music mostly.  And so --

3.  -- the music choices, sequence, and remixes were mostly top notch.  Honestly.  I learned a few songs I didnt know and enjoyed some reinvigorated songs like CAN YOU FEEL IT -- really a Jacksons song but who cares?

What lacked in the music was that sometimes there was too much sound.  A reviewer below says he walked out.  I understand why.  

At times -- especially during the second song -- the production was a wall of noise instead of a Jackson wall of sound.  Theres a difference and IT MATTERS.  And during these everything and the kitchen sink moments the volume was on Spinal Tap 11.  Utterly juvenile.  And sad.

Theres a reason why most of this music went worldwide.  Cirque went sometimes went overboard remixing and needs to come back a little.  Yeah, I get it, you have a subwoofer the size of a navel submarine under the seats.  So what?  Take it down a notch, Cirque.

So, overall, the music is why you see this show.  The production values --

4.  -- were a mess.  Stevie Wonder could do a better job.  It was like a militia from a noir sci-fi movie was blended on high with a gay pride parade... and the lid came flying off.  

Any five seconds of Cirque O compared to ONE and you realize the ONE production designers should have been fired.  Presuming any were hired.  

(To be fair, there were some amazing design moments.  A number done in the shadows was what made me aware of how garish the remainder of the show was.  And there was a... umm... costume design worth the price of admission.)

What was also weird about ONE was the show was oddly.... dinky.  Big sound, yes, but small cast, small stage.  It reminded me of OVO or TOTEM sized tent shows -- which isnt Vegas impressive.  (Kinda scammish, really.)

There was an issue with women in this show too.  Two MJ songs scream for fabulous babes:  THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL and DIRTY DIANA.   The women that appeared leaned a little too close to drag queens... echoing a theme by the guitarist I shall refer to here as Goldmember.  What Im trying to say here is that in a city full of knockout women... why did this show present... second rate babes?   And a lady who was a dead ringer for Ellen Degeneres?  It was just... strange.

There WAS a dude dancer worth half your ticket admission price.  I wont give him away, but lets just say hed be awesome in a PLASTIC MAN movie.    The thing is they kinda reused him once or twice, and again, Im like is this a tiny tent show or a Vegas event?

The word mess must be examined again.  Sorry fans, but MJ the man was a bit of a mess in his later decades.  And so the fact the show reflects this isnt the worst thing to happen to ONE.  The problem is that Cirque has been producing lots of messes recently -- and so I fear this wasnt an artistic choice but another trip down Viva Elvis or Iris or Zarkana lane.

A bad show?  No.  But it had bad Vegas show elements.  If youre in Vegas and a show is blasting hot flame to spice things up... its because theyre afraid you have fallen asleep.   Cirque O has flames, yes, but if you know the show its very artful. 

And so, again:  3.5 stars.  Oh, and since Ive seen every Cirque show in Vegas, it goes like this --

Cirque O is the best show, providing you see it in the best seats.  Center, about ten rows back.  

Beatles LOVE is second.  Not so Cirque but oh so Magical Mystery Tour.  You can see this show more than once from different seats.  Awesome.

Id say ONE and MYSTERE tie for third depending upon your taste."
MJ One,"This show is so beautiful. I highly recommend this show. If youre an old fan, or new fan, you will be amazed by the whole performance and you also get to enjoy his music."
MJ One,"Low on acrobatics, but high on entertainment. This is by far, one of my favorite cirque shows!  Its a trip back to memory lane and a heart pounding 90 minutes that will have you on the edge of your seat.  

Theres a lot to appreciate about this show -- the sound, the stage, the set, the costumes, the incredible dancers, the (reproduction?) of MJs music, etc... So much to appreciate that I would even recommend it to those who arent a huge fan of MJ."
MJ One,"Ok, overall a good show. Very upbeat. But, way too intense for (my) kids. Probably about 30 mins of it they would love. 

The MJ Holograms were incredible, as were some of the performers. Some seemed to serve no purpose though (guitar player woman). 

The show definitely seemed to be trying too hard at times. The music would have been much better at about 75% of the level they were using. 

Ill stick with Beatles Love."
MJ One,"Amazing dancers, music and production. Really enjoyed this show and I really recommend it!"
MJ One,"The music is awesome. If youre a MJ fan you will love this show. 

The guitarist was over-utilized and if youre gonna have that part of the show integrated that often at least get a real guitar player. 

Chasing the glove had no entertainment value. 

The hologram number will give you chills and reminds you just how good of an entertainer MJ really was."
MJ One,"Excellent performance from the Cirque de Soleil talents. They re-lived MJs hits songs and dance numbers. Definitely worth every penny me and my husband spent! The best show we ever seen in Vegas by far! Got so excited when I saw MJ on hologram perform Man in the Mirror . Im coming back to see it again, this time Ill bring my kids."
MJ One,Seriously one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen.  I have gone twice just because it is that good.  There is so much going on during each performance that is is hard to pick one place to look.  The entire cast is incredibly talented.  The way the songs are incorporated in the story line and choreographed is fabulous.  Certain parts really evoke emotion in the audience.  Standing ovation every time.
MJ One,I dont know why this is getting some low reviews. I guess people wanted more acrobatics. I thought it had just enough acrobatics and tons of killer dancing which is what Michael Jackson is known for. Played all the hits. The effects were stunning and spectacular. I dont know more what people want. I thought it was fantastic. Id definitely see it again or recommend it to anyone. I even had the cheapest seats in the house and it was still great. The view was just fine even in the very back. Great sound. Great show. A+
MJ One,"An amazing show, probably the best that Vegas has to offer, from the dancers to the way everything was set up to actually seeing Michael dance himself, its a must go for all MJ fans"
MJ One,"Best show in Vegas - and it pains me to say that because I absolutely love Absinthe. But damn, this show gives you a SHOW!! If youre a big fan, and even if youre just a casual fan like me, of Michael Jackson, this show is for you. Youll find yourself singing along to the familiar soundtrack when your jaw isnt dropped from the amazing cirque performers, dancers, light shows and oh yeah the friggin hologram of MJ himself!

The show is the right balance of Michael Jackson and Cirque du Soleil. Perfect and everything I wanted in a Vegas show. My only complaint was I never knew where to look because there was always so much to see and take in.

Id check out the gift shop early because its a madhouse after the show. Oh and we bought the program which was worth it."
MJ One,"I love Cirque du Soleil. First time I was at the O show about ten years ago. After that I visit your shows every time I come to Las Vegas. For the past few years I was at O, Ka, Zumanity. 

5 March 2016 me and my wife went to The One show and we had a really bad experience. Our evening was completely ruined by the show staff. We never had any issues at Cirque du Soleil shows before but not this time.

Heres what happened:

We were in line for drinks at the bar at The One show. The bartender asked no ID of any people in the line and all other barmen did the same. Me and my wife are 35 years old but we are often asked IDs at different bars, this is fine, probably we look young. The line was long and we had only 5 minutes left until the beginning of the show so I prepared our IDs to save time. The barmen were rushing everybody in line - they were taking orders from the next people in line while the previous clients were still paying for their orders. When we made our order I handled my credit card and our IDs to the bartender. He asked if we had passports because he would not accept our IDs. Our IDs are issued in Ukraine but this is my 10th visit to US and I never (never!) had any issues with our IDs. I come to the US about 3 times a year. I rented many cars, booked hotels, went to numerous bars and restaurants with this same ID and nobody ever asked for my passport! This would be fine if the bartender did it in a friendly manner. However, the way the bartender behaved himself and how he was speaking to us was very rude, mean and unfriendly. I tried to explain something to him but he said that he will not sell us any drinks and said that we must move to the side. I asked him to call the manager. He replied to me I will not call the manager!. I asked why we need to show the passports since we showed valid IDs, he replied These are our rules, I asked were are those rules shown, he said that he will call the security and it will confirm his words and the rules. I asked to call the security (as he refused to call the manager). When the security guy came, everything repeated, the security asked for the passport and said again These are our rules. I asked to call the manager. They said they called the manager (though I am bot sure about it, I havent seen or heard them doing so). The show has already started, we waited for the manager for about 5 minutes, nobody showed up and we went inside the auditorium, we were late for the first act, had to make everyone in our row to stand up to let us pass (the rows at the theatre are very narrow, everybody must stand up to make pass). All the evening and the shaw itself was ruined and spoiled as me and my wife were so irritated by your unprofessional and mean staff that we could not relax and concentrate on the show.

I know something about clients service, bad managers and bad employees. This shows staff violated all basic rules of clients service:
- the bartender was mean, rude, behaved unpolitely
- he was rushing all the clients
- he refused to call the manager when I specifically asked him to do so
- he said these are rules and didnt even try to help me (at least he could ask if we had photos of our passports, which we had), staff must never say these are our rules, it is absolutely unprofessional, specially if the rule is stupid
- the rule, if it exists, is stupid
- there is no sign nor any document (like terms and conditions) in the bar saying that I need to show a passport instead of an ID (or together with the iD)
- the manager didnt show up (or maybe nobody even called him)

This ruined our evening. We were not able to calm down, relax, distract from the situation, the show went on but we were thinking about the situation whom and were to complain.

At the contrary I must mention that a few days earlier I went to O with my 5 years old kid and we had a pleasant experience at the bar. The bartender at O said that kids are not allowed in the bar but he did it in a very pleasant, friendly and professional manner. So not all staff at Cirque du Soleil is so rude. 

I wrote an e-mail to the customers support but havent yet received even an automatic reply I love Cirque du Soleil. First time I was at the O show about ten years ago. After that I visit your shows every time I come to Las Vegas. For the past few years I was at O, Ka, Zumanity."
MJ One,"Very nostalgic musical ensemble celebrating Michael Jacksons life going back to the Jackson Five thru the time of his death. It was an excellent performance although the action and movement among the circus performers was by far the least that I have ever seen in any other Cirque de Soleil. It was a nice space and great acoustics. I strongly recommend the show, particularly for Michael Jackson fans."
MJ One,"Wow. I grew up watching Michael Jackson. I got my first cassette tape when I was 5 in 1983 of Michael Jackson.  I dont normally like these dancing and performance shows but this is hands down best musical and dance performance. This is a must go. My only complaint is the music was extremely LOUD.  Tickets were pricey at $150 each but you can pay less. In my opinion, even if you bought the least expensive tickets, you can get just as a good of view if you bought the most expensive ticket."
MJ One,"AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL performers, very very immersive experience, worth every pennies!!! Best seats sit and watch is about 8th from the stage, centered, so you can get in all the view from front, sides, and back because the performers will come from every corners of the theater to give you that immersive experience."
MJ One,"Anyone who doesnt give this show Five Stars does not LOVE Michael Jackson.  Okay, you may LOVE him for Four Stars. Others may like him, enjoy him, but dont love him.  No spoilers will come from me here.

I will say that I was on the edge of my seat the entire show, in awe.  I laughed, I cried, I danced, it was an experience.  It ended and I wanted so much more.

Just enough Cirque, but so much MJ.  Tips, sit on an aisle, the back row of the front  floor level or the front row of the Balcony.  Be on time, they start on time, and you may have to wait to a pause in the action to be seated.  Theres no intermission, pee before, you dont want to miss a beat.

Next time Im in Vegas I will be back because this was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen."
MJ One,"If there were 10 stars to give, Id give them 11. This show was spectacular from beginning to end. The performers interacted with the audience before the show started and the theatre was small enough that it seemed like you couldnt miss anything no matter where you were. I didnt quite figure out the silver glove storyline, but it was not a deal breaker. The Dirty Diana quixotic  routine was my favorite."
MJ One,"We were lucky enough to get free tickets to this show.  We had incredible seats and had an even better view.  

Parking at Mandalay Bay wasnt a problem in the garage.  Just a small walk to get inside the casino itself and, off to find the One Theater.  After going the wrong way at first we finally gather our bearings and start moving in the right way.  We finally get to the theater, stand in line to check in, head upstairs to get to our seats and settle in for the show.

After a few minutes of being there the lights go down and the show starts. From start to finish we were thoroughly entertained.  From music to dancing it was non stop entertainment.  Not a dull moment or lag in the show.  Aerial acrobatics, trampoline and balance work, hologram Michael and a fantastic guitarist were just the highlights for me.

The show made me want to revisit my MJ collection.  Great performance and highly reccommended."
MJ One,"Wow.  I mean seriously,.. Wow.

Im not a new Cirque fan.  MJ One was my eighth Cirque show, and it is terrific.

The music is excellent.
The dancing is excellent at a world-class gymnastic level.
The effects are beyond excellent, including the best holographic projection Ive ever seen.

The show ran 1:40, and it felt like about 20 minutes.  You just get lost into the show.

The theatre was not built ground-up as a Cirque du Soliel site, which I had wondered if it would be a problem.  Nope.  Not a problem at all.

Dont sit closer than about Row 20, or youll miss some things going on behind you.

Oh, and if you cant talk your husband into going, drop the tidbit that during Dirty Diana there is the hottest pole dancer (clothed) in existence working three separate poles.

Ill go see it again the next time we go to Vegas."
MJ One,"Great show, definitely go if youre a Michael Jackson fan. Its well choreographed. They did all of his hits."
MJ One,Excellent show. Theres so much I liked its hard to put it in words. Its a sensory massage. The cast interaction with the audience was great.  I will see it again. The Michael Jackson hologram dance number was spectacular.
MJ One,Must see if youre a MJ fan.  Its a little pricy for tickets but the Billy Jean portion alone is worth the price of admission.
MJ One,"Pretty close to 5 stars, but they didnt play one of my MJ faves Rock With You. Nonetheless, it is one of the best Cirque shows Ive seen so far. 

Having been a Michael Jackson fan since I was a kid (owned Thriller on vinyl!), I knew I wanted to see this show. I had heard they had a previous Cirque show but never had a chance to watch it. So during our recent trip to Vegas, my boyfriend bought us tickets as a birthday present to me. We bought seats in Section 203, smack dab in the middle (and therefore middle in price), but most every seat in the house was amazing, including the ones in the very back.

I must be honest - its got great Cirque type acrobatic but I was more focused on the dancing and tribute to Michael himself. I literally was dancing in my seat the entire time. From Billie Jean to Thriller to Bad to Beat It, I was transported back to my youth and loved every second. I read somewhere that each seat has 3 speakers in them, so the music blasted loud throughout the theater (maybe too loud for some sensitive ears.) My favorite part had to be Man In The Mirror, which brought a few tears to my eyes since it made me realize how much musical/dance talent was lost when Michael passed. 

If you are a Michael Jackson fan, it is definitely a show to check out!"
MJ One,"Went to this show today with my wife. We needed to leave about 15mins in. The sound is just too LOUD. Its absolutely crazy. Im not sensitive to loud music and I have been to many concerts and shows before, but this was absolutely unbearable. My ears are still hurting. Under no circumstances bring your kids here. If you are seated in the middle sections its a severe threat to their long term health!!! Absolutely crazy. AVOID!! (the show itself wasnt that great either - Id say its cool if youre a Michael Jackson fan, everyone else can skip it. Totally overhyped)"
MJ One,"Oh my.  Im lost for words to describe this show.  It was beautiful, and I loved every minute of it.  

I used to be a HUGE Michael fan, I went to Dangerous tour back in 92 and 93 in Japan and also his 25 year reunion live in NY in 01.  Also, I love Cirque du Soleil -  my hubby and I enjoyed O, Ka, Zumanity, Love, and Mystere.  (O is still my favorite among those.)  So it might be only natural that I loved it so much.

If you think Michael is cool, and know his songs from his peak days like my husband, youll enjoy the show, but probably not as much as I did.  

The first thing I asked my hubby after the show was Did YOU enjoy it?  And his answer was Yeah, but probably not as much as you did.  It was good though!

One thing to note is that they did more recent songs that not many people are familiar with.  One of the songs that they did so beautifully and made me actually teared up was Stranger in Moscow, but I dont think my hubby even heard of that song before.  
 
I dont think They dont care about us or Scream has the same impact as Billy Jean or Thriller to some people.  

But like I said, if you are a fan, you will be amazed by what Cirque du Soleil did with his legacy.  Im always amazed by Cirque du Soleil, but this time, it was magical."
MJ One,"Wonderful show!  I am a huge Cirque fan!  This show is not a typical Cirque show but still breath taking.  I actually had chills while watching!  This show focuses on the Music (you are completely immersed in the music, there are speakers in front of you and in the head rest of your chair), dancing and choreography.  The dancers were amazing.  Everyone was completely in sync and the moves were impressive---perfectly fit with all the MJ hits.  I actually recommend that you sit in the upper section.  There are dancers all around.  I feel like I missed some of the action sitting close.

Like all Cirque shows, one time is not enough.  There is so much to see and look at during the show, there is no way to see it all in one viewing!  Bravo Cirque!"
MJ One,"Truthfully I almost fell asleep.

Im not sure if it was the huge Bacchanalia buffet I just had at Caesars or from just being tired after a long night out or if Im just not really a fan of Michael Jackson -- but this show was making me get some serious ZZzzzs!

There were certain song scenes that instantly made we wake up (or was that just when I forced myself to take big gulps from my ice water?) Also one of my favorite songs You are not alone barely had any play time. And finally, a lot of the dance sequences I feel like Ive seen on TV already - so it wasnt anything new.

Overall just average for a cirque show."
MJ One,"I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)
Dance You Into Day (Sunlight)
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)
Were Gonna Rock The Night Away at...CIRQUE MICHAEL JACKSON ONE! - Michael Jackson (rock with you)

This is definitely the most popular Cirque show right now in Vegas. I guess they werent kidding when they said that this show consistently sells out; it was packed even during the 9:30 showing.

Its loud, its fun, embodies the spirit of MJ...dont want to spoil anything but this is the ONE show to watch!

A quick heads up after the show: the taxi line will get crowded fast so either haul your butt (good luck with high heels) or chill around for a bit for the crowd to settle."
MJ One,"One of the best Cirque/Franco Dragone shows Ive seen on the Strip, and Ive seen all except Zumanity, Zarkana, and Mystere.

Whether or not youre an MJ fan, prepare to be spellbound. I truly feel that ONE was successfully able to capture a part of MJs soul and execute it in visual and audio form. There were moments where it felt like Michaels ghost was there. 

See it. Its worth the $$$$. I cried...twice."
MJ One,"Had a great time seeing One this last weekend. This is the 3rd Cirque show I have seen and probably the most different of all of them. Usually Cirque is known for their death-defying and mind blowing aerobatics, but this show is more of a dance and performance show. There is definitely some amazing aerial work during Thriller, but that was really the extent of it in my opinion. That being said, a 90 minute show with great Micheal Jackson music, excellent dancing, and great visuals effects made this show a blast to watch!"
MJ One,"While not your typical cirque, still an amazing show! If youre looking for the crazy aerobatics, another show like O at the Bellagio might be better. 

However if you love the music, amazing dancing, crazy lights and effects then youll love it!

And as amazing as the dancers are - when theyre dancing with MJ - you know hes the king!"
MJ One,"The show was massive and enjoyable. They bring the show down the isle, close to the audience. The theater is beautiful and the seats are wide and comfortable. Id you are in Vegas a must see show."
MJ One,"Michael Jackson fan since childhood and this was a wonderful tribute to him and his music. The show covered music from the Jackson 5 days to his last songs - we were all singing and dancing in our chairs.  The set was amazing - beautiful designs, incredible special effects and the sound system was great. 

The storyline of the show was a bit corny and a couple of the dancers were off (which for the money they shouldnt have been!) BUT all in all it was a fantastic, fun show.  

Was it overpriced? totally - BUT not unlike any other entertainment youd spend money on from amusement parks to snacks at a movie theatre. It costs what it costs and when its over youre glad you were there."
MJ One,Small venue but still great show.  The music and show was outstanding.  Dont waste money on the high priced seats.  They are all good.
MJ One,"As a life-long, hardcore but not weirdly insane, MJ fan, I was super excited and grateful to have had the opportunity to see MJ ONE this week. Overall, it was an amazing experience.

From a Cirque perspective, it was a bit light on the acrobatics and featured more dancing, which I can understand, but I was hoping for more of the jaw-dropping stuff we all know Cirque performers are capable of doing. Not to diminish the impressive physicality of this show... its quite good, but I think there could be more WHOA. The dancer who recreates MJs signature moves is phenomenal though. His flexibility and grace on stage is beautiful.

From a MJ fan perspective, nothing will ever match or even meet Michaels ability and energy on stage, and while its phenomenal to hear his music in a theatre, itll always be a reminder hes no longer here. Personally, its an emotional experience, especially seeing other people appreciate and enjoy his work. But the bittersweet element cant be dismissed. MJ should still be here, creating and delighting and inspiring, and enjoying the impact his work continues to make on the world.

Lastly, I wanted to buy everything in the MJ ONE store. No self-restraint. Its good stuff. Id like to see a bigger pre-show exhibit, too, although Im guessing that would take away gaming floor space. Also, if the soundtrack for ONE is different than the Immortal soundtrack, release it! Please!"
MJ One,"Weve been great fans and seen every production of the Cirque du Soleil portfolio over many years. This was notably different, weaker on the artistic touches and whimsy, seemingly attempting to compensate by increasing the music volume to uncomfortable levels. This may work in Las Vegas but likely would not survive reviews by Cirque fans if taken on the road. Disappointing."
MJ One,"I was a big fan of Michael Jackson growing up and this show Does a great job of honoring his talent.  The lights, dancing, music, no detail is left out.  Who ever put this show together is so creative and amazing.  Best show I have been to in Vegas.  All the seats in the great with a great view of the stage and all the theatrics dropping from the ceiling.   Go and enjoy the blending of music from the 70 to present day."
MJ One,"Another Cirque show that is worth seeing. Its not your typical Cirque show. The music was good the effects were fantastic. It brought back a lot of memories. I enjoyed how they tied the Music and the theme of the Jackson Five. However, I was expecting more acrobatics, which Cirque is famous for, rather than the dance factor. The show is definitely worth seeing."
MJ One,"Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil at Mandalay Bay is such a good show.  I saw it tonight and it was even better than I expected.  This coming from someone who has never really been too interested in Michael Jacksons work.

The show was really amazing from top to bottom.  I dont have any real complaints besides we sat 2nd row from the stage which might have been a bit too close to take it all in. The show lasted 90 minutes but definitely did not drag on. The 90 minutes went by fast.  Great production!"
MJ One,"OHHH I ORIGINALLY POSTED ON THE WRONG LISTING LOL.. OOPS
My man took me here to perfectly end the most perfect birthday weekend ever ;]]]
I will admit we were both a bit tired from the long day that we had but once we got inside of the theatre all tiredness went away.. maybe it was the rockin MJ vibe or maybe it was our extra large crown &amp; diet but we were ready to rock &amp; roll!!! 

Although there were some slow moments in the show there were more good moments than bad... I especially liked the routine with the extremely fit dancer on the pole (side note: why do I always like the stripper pole routines so much? haha) &amp; the stripper pole wasnt even a regular pole it was like some crazy winding pole!!! Also I loved the guy who did the crazy stuff on the rope (probably the most typical Cirque performance of the night) &amp; of course Thriller... how can you not like Thriller??? Our favorite by far though was the Billie Jean performance!!! Those light-up suits are amazing! They should perform that routine at EDC I bet all the kandi kids would love it too ;ppp 
By the final act, my boyfriend and pretty much the whole audience was up on their feet singing and dancing along to Black or White HAHA 

Yes, the show isnt completely filled with OH $HIIIIIT moments but it will have you reminiscing and singing MJ songs for days. Definitely very entertaining &amp; enjoyable and this is coming from someone who was born in the 90s and is not a die-hard MJ fan! Also, I wish they did something with the song PYT :[ 

Question: Is the rocker who kind of looks like Lady Gaga really playing the electric guitar live??? If not I found him/her to be quite distracting during some acts... IDK..

HOT TIP: all the seats are good because the theatre is not that big but I would recommend getting floor seats that are right by the aisles because they utilize the aisles a lot~"
MJ One,"As a Michael Jackson fan I wasnt sure if this would be a bit overwhelming since the artist wouldnt actually be present and wasnt sure if anyone could really pull off doing an entire concert not even being the singer himself however this show was AMAZING. from the beginning to the end you get an amazing feel of MJ and his legacy he left behind. The music is awesome obviously its him singing and the artists dancing are phenomenal. Each song had their own themes and plots and it was beautifully done with lighting and sound. Make sure you watch this show. We were in row HH and saw everything. Tickets cost us 100$ each after a 20% off discount. Must see this even if you are not a fan the theatricals and the acrobatics is amazing. Also, they have an entire michael Jackson bar, the venue is filled with workers dressed in costumes and the whole feel is awesome.  Will definitely go back to watch it again L!"
MJ One,"Combining MJ with CDS was a masterpiece, but your going to pay the price for just relatively good seats. In the end, I felt it was worth it, terrific show and an awesome tribute to the King of Pop."
MJ One,"Trying not to exaggerate here....but frankly, this is the greatest show Ive ever seen.  Cirque, or otherwise.   

Could not get over the production value, dancing, music, and special effects.  The MJ hologram was incredible. The timing of the dancers in response to the hologram and the fact that it lasts for almost the entire song was amazing.  I experienced the 2pac hologram at Coachella a few years ago...and while that was cool, it pales in comparison to what they did at One.  

The Billie Jean dancers were literally (not figuratively) moonwalking on the walls.  The intro screen before that song, where they show a collage of MJ performances was also great.  Sets the tone for the next scene.  

Thriller scen was so dead-on accurate and really brought back that feeling you got when you first saw the video.  We sat front row and the dancers/zombies were literally all over us.  

I can go on and on....but in essence, the beauty of One comes from its ability to capture all that was MJs art. The skill, the precision, and the surreal nature of his music and performances are all here.  They are capped off with subtle messages that remind us of what MJ contributed to the art world and the scope of his talents.  

Full disclosure, I love MJs music and was a huge MJ fan growing up.  However, even if I wasnt, I believe Id come away with the same feeling.  

MJ would certainly be proud if he were able to see it.  Congratulations on an amazing production.

MJ One,"You cant believe everything you see. This may be especially true in vegas. 

But believe what youre seeing in this show - even when its absolutely blowing your mind!

I went into this a mediocre MJ fan. Thought the tickets were somewhat overpriced, and purchased furthest back row-corner seats. Got to the theater right at 9:30 (Mandalay Bay is quite a ways down the strip, if youre not familiar) and missed the opening things people mention on here, and were held back from being seated until the first act was over. During this, a kind doorman upgraded our seats to 10th row back from stage - what a kind and completely selfless act from him, just so that we could enjoy this show in its entirety, and that we did! 

Standing waiting to be seated, I fell in love immediately with the first act and became more entranced with each one after that. Acrobatics are extremely impressive and tied in flawlessly with dancing. Music is crisp, clear and loud! Tons of very talented actors involved.

 If youre going to see a cirque type show in Vegas and this even mildly interests you...GO SEE IT! If youre at all a MJ fan...GO SEE IT! If youre reading this review for any reason...GO SEE IT! Im telling you, youre missing out if you dont. 

Also, if you get pumped up enough for some dancing during the show, go on a night for LIGHTS (the MB nightclub) afterwards - we got comped in with free drinks for the lady and had an absolute blast the whole night! YOU CANNOT MISS THIS EXPERIENCE!!! 

I will be back."
MJ One,"If you love Michael Jackson and Cirque du Soleil, just buy tickets online right away, and come see the show. Best ever interpretation of MJ s music and essence. The surround sound system is phenomenal is this theatre, as Ive rediscovered his songs!!"
MJ One,"I am a big fan of Cirques musical icon shows.  I have seen the Beetles and the Elvis shows.  I really like the more focused message and themes presented.  Some of the non music shows I find too fragmented.  This show will surprise you with its technical innovation as well as its appropriate focus on Michael Jackson style dancing.  I really enjoyed it.   Its unlike any other Cirque du Soleil show I have ever seen.  If you appreciate Michaels music or dancing,  you will be blown away by this show!  The theater is smaller and the show often encompasses the entire theater.  I dont want to spoil it but the thriller number was one of my favorites.  The costumes are just incredible. You will see many things in this show you havent seen before and might even be surprised more than once.  I highly recommend it!"
MJ One,"First and foremost I am not a Michael Jackson  fan.  Having said that this show was fantastic!

Between the zombies in the aisles to the hologram of MJ signing it was a great show.

Starts with photographers taking your pictures in the lobby.

Price was a little high $180 for me.  But still a great 90 minute show."
MJ One,"Went to this show with my wife, very excited as we are huge MJ fans. Weve seen several other shows in Vegas and love the entertainment aspect of them. One was great as far as music goes or some of the acrobatics but ONE very important thing was missing!!! There was NO Michael Jackson (impersonator) in the show!! We were waiting for the Michael character the entire time. It was disappointing to say the least that he wasnt in it. Dont waste your money on this show."
MJ One,"Let me just say that this show is a little bit different than the other Cirque shows on the strip. There is a little less acrobat and more dancing which makes sense since its a tribute to Michael Jackson. But let me tell ya, the dancing was excellent. Its like watching Jabbawockeez. There was this one guy who had some pretty smooth moves.. almost close to Michael. The whole cast is very enthusiastic and really get the whole audience to participate. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because Im young. I was born during the peak of his career so Im not that big of a fan. However, I knew enough songs to enjoy the show. My favorite would have to be when they did the Thriller Dance. As long as you know some songs from Michael, you will definitely enjoy this show!

Songs they played: Thriller, Billy Jean, Beat it, You are not alone, They dont care about us, Man in the Mirror (those are the ones I recognize)"
MJ One,I can say anything except that you gotta go.  Dont even think about.  A very moving show you get to understand Michael Jackson even more..... Appreciating what he accomplished in life.
MJ One,"Live theater is dear to me since my high school/colleges days in the theater arts department.

I have seen live theater in Sacramento, San Francisco,  NYC, London  and Las Vegas.

The Beatles Love and last nights Michael Jackson show are worth the airfare and hotel costs to LV. Average tickets are about $70. a person compared to NYC average $200. a head price . No major time zone problems and plenty of good places to eat for all income levels.

The MJ show is so good it makes me cry at the thought of our worlds loss of this special artist and the energy he gave us to want to dance and sing like we use a long, long time ago."
MJ One,"Loved it! Sat in the 5th row (Gold Circle) for the show this past Saturday night and it was great.... I didnt pay for the tickets myself so I cant honestly say whether it is worth the ticket price or not and the only other Cirque show I have seen is LOVE so I dont have any comparisons to other shows. With that being said, is my review now useless? O_o

Pros:
- Music (of course).... if you dont like Michael, dont go to the show... simple as that
- Dancing was very good
- Bit of a storyline to it, which I enjoyed
- Acrobatics and other cirquey-ness (yup, I said that).... while not as spectacular as some other shows Im sure, it is enough to keep me entertained and was pretty phenomenal nonetheless
- Hologram... since everyone else spilled the beans already I can say without feeling bad that this was pretty freaking cool

Cons (not necessarily my cons but I can see how they can be for others):
- If you are there for Cirque and not as a MJ fan... youre gonna have a bad time. As mentioned above, not a ton of crazy acrobatics and stuff.
- Really wish the hologram would have been closer to the front of stage but still amazing anyway
- Few points in the show feel like filler with not much going on other than video

All in all, big fan and would love to go see it again in a year to see if anything changes. So who wants to take me?"
MJ One,"Awesome show! I enjoyed the show and I didnt want to miss a thing.  To my surprise I was photographed by ushers as I entered the theater,  and I could never be a celebrity for no one would buy my pictures for the media.  I took a bad surprised photo.  great choreography put together."
MJ One,"Ive seen most of the Circ shows and this one was awesome. I never followed MJ like some but enough to know about hom and his music. There were times during the show it gave me the chills. 
I went off another review in here on seating and they were right about every seat is nice. No need to get a top priced ticket as even in back of Mandalay Bay its a great show....a definite show to see in Vegas!!! Its beyond 5 stars."
MJ One,"Excellent! Great theatre, wonderful show. Highly entertaining and visually stunning. This show is one of the ones I feel is definitely worth seeing."
MJ One,"Simply SPECTACULAR show!!! The word show somehow is so menial to describe this performance by amazingly gifted and talented performers. Thank you to Cirque, Welby, Kevin Antoons and so many more for creating such a brilliant tribute for Michael. Thank you for honoring the MJ fans wishes. My only complaint is that I wanted it to last longer... just never end!! Immersed totally... totally nourished in MJ, his genius, his art, his spirit. An incredibly beautiful, energizing, spellbinding tribute to Michael Jackson. Thank you to Cirque and the Estate of Michael Jackson for producing and creating this incredibe honor to MJs legacy and his genius. God bless you all!! 

I saw this amazing show on the 28th with the MJ fans, again on the 29th for the Premier and then attended the After Party to end all parties. Thank you so much to the Michael Jackson Estate for your generosity and the amazingly fun and rockin after party. Not sure you will ever be topping that one! Thank you! Thank you! A total BLAST!! 

Looking forward to seeing MJ One again soon!! This will definitely be an every year event for MJ fans from around the world. 

Oh and just wanted to say for those asking... the blonde guitar player also represented Jennifer Batten who played guitar in those crazy costumes with the big blonde hair on all of Michaels tours."
MJ One,"This is the best tribute show to the late Michael Jackson! The talent is top notch. Second time seeing it and was just as exciting to show my kids since they love his music too. One dancer stole the show! The hologram was really neat, felt like you were at his concert with the amazing sounds and dancing! Hats off to all of you! Bravo bravo!!"
MJ One,"This is the best Cirque show in Vegas. What makes it the best is they truly channel Michael Jackson. The theater, performance, authenticity...theres been a lot of thought and effort in the choreography. 

Go see this show..."
MJ One,"My gf wanted to see this so I booked it online (will call), easy enough. We got the later show because it had better seat options. We got the lower level and aisle seats. Perfect, at one point the performers were right next to here dancing!! 

They do sell overpriced snacks (popcorn, candies and sodas) and drinks. 

My gf loved the show I thought it was pretty good. If you try to follow the story youll get lost so just enjoy the music and performance. The only other Cirque du Soleil show weve been to was O, and compared to that this shows acrobatics isnt as impressive. But it still is very entertaining."
MJ One,"Just saw One last night and it was an amazing show.  Tickets were pricey, so I bought the 3 corner tickets for $75 each and the view was perfectly fine since the theater isnt too big.

Dont want to spoil any surprises by talking about any specific scenes too much.  Ill just say its a really well thought out production and ode to MJ.  More focused on music and dancing than other Cirques, also more modern techniques and effects than other shows.  Cirque really showed an evolution in their vision and captured the spirit of Michael well.

Only other musical Cirque Ive seen is Beatles Love, which I liked, but like One a lot more.  Highly recommended!"
MJ One,"I hear it is not your typical Circ De Soleil show (less circ, more show), but we totally loved it! It was amazing music, dance, and energy. if you are a fan of Michael, you are very likely to enjoy it. Because the show is all around you and is very dynamic, I would recommend getting seats towards the back for a better overall picture. So if you got your tickets, get ready for 2 hours of awesomeness!"
MJ One,"Love Michael Jackson, this show was amazing. 

This is a fairly new cirque du soleil show at the Mandalay Bay so we wanted to see it while we were in Vegas. Best decision ever :) we had so much fun during the show, we just wanted to stand up and dance the whole time (but we didnt want to look crazy). The show is about 1 1/2 hours, it was so good that we wished it was a little longer. The dancing and stage presence were over the top and amusing to watch. RIP MJ.. and watch this if youre in town!"
MJ One,"Me and my wife saw it last year, and can remember leaving thinking it was pretty awesome, especially the hologram and light up sequences, would highly recommend to any MJ fan... but if your more into acrobatics then you should probably see another cirque show"
MJ One,I love this show. Im so happy going for my birthday everything Michael Jackson birthday wish came true :)
MJ One,"Amazing show!  Id see it again in a heart beat.  Fantastic dancers with an amazing sound system and some great visual effects.  This may beat LOVE for me and Im a huge Beatles fan.

Seat advice:  Definitely get seats in the lower section. This theater is more like a traditional theater and it was really fun seeing the moonwalk from a few rows back.

As Cirque shows go this one actually seems to have a plot line. Four dysfunctional teens  build confidence in themselves and use MJs clothing for the powers of good. Captain EO meets the Breakfast Club."
MJ One,"I LOVE this show. Ive seen four Cirque shows and this is my favorite. 

Im in love with the show so much, I wish I could work there!

I left the show in tears from the overwhelming joy I felt from being a Michael Jackson fan and seeing his work displayed in this manner. Its a true tribute to MJ that we can all be proud of. 

My only advice on a sour note, do not drink their frozen fruit liquor drink slushies.. I had the grape one and the liquor had turned from being spoiled. 

The show quality was outstanding, the dancers and performers were clean and crisp on their moves and acrobatics, and the costuming was fantastic. They literally played every single MJ song that I wanted to hear tonight:)) 

This show was well worth the price. Splurge;)"
MJ One,"In a word, AMAZING.

Ive seen two other Cirque shows, O and Iris...and loved them both.  This one is different for sure...less acrobatics, more dancing.  The lighting and effects are stunning, and the music is awesome, of course!

The show is about 90 minutes and there was not a boring moment whatsoever.  I am reluctant to tell you which parts I liked the best, because I feel like it might ruin some of the wow moments for you.  Ill just say that the show blew me away, and I am already making plans to go see it again.  

The theater is only 32 rows...so all the seats are pretty good.  We got the mid-range tickets, which were $108...and while I was happy with the seats we had, I will probably spring for the $150 tickets next time.

If youre in Vegas, GO.  You will not be disappointed."
MJ One,"Outstanding show!!! One of the best shows in Vegas. It cost more than the other Vegas cirque shows but it was well worth it. Would love to watch it again. 

If you enjoyed the Beatles Love show, youll love this show. 

The show was given a well deserved standing ovation at the end."
MJ One,"This is by far one of my favorite Cirque du Soleil show. Great music, acrobatics and dancing. Reminded me how great of an entertainer and dancer Michael Jackson was. Great mix of his music and videos of his past performances were incorporated well into the show. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the shear loudness of the music especially in the beginning to the point my seat was shaking. My younger 12 year old daughter kept complaining about it. I had to give her ear buds that I just happen to have to help her muffle the noise a bit. It might have been because we were seated towards the front but if you have children who are sensitive to noise volume you might want to bring some ear plugs. The beginning story line was a bit confusing to. But it made me want to go watch it again just to understand it better and and because we enjoyed the show so much. A must see if you are in Vegas and a music lover."
MJ One,Went to see the show for my birthday. I was not disappointed!! There are no words to describe how amazing the show was!! At times there was so much going on I didnt know where to look!! You dont even have to second guess seeing this show!!! I enjoyed the music so much... What a way to tribute such a great artist!!!
MJ One,"I loved this show!!! Im a huuuuuge MJ fan!

The dancers were in sync, the sound system was great, and the visual effects were bright and detailed. You could tell the dancers loved what they were doing! 

My face hurt from smiling the whole time! There wasnt a dull moment---it was pure energy the whole time. I finally teared up when there was a Michael Jackson hologram; I felt he was standing right in front of me. 

At first I didnt get the four characters and how they connected to the story, and I actually still dont get the storyline, but I did enjoy the props and how they connected with Michael Jackson. 

Go see it!!!"
MJ One,"OMJ!!! It was like Michael Jackson was performing and still ALIVE! he IS still ALIVE, thanks to Cirque du Soleil. 

Words cant even describe what one must see and experience in person. If you have to see ONE show in Vegas, make sure it is Michael Jackson ONE at Mandalay Bay!

You will be singing and dancing just like you are at his concert..."
MJ One,"My husband and I were in Vegas recently and when I heard this show had opened, I knew we had to go (Im a huge MJ fan). We went on a Monday evening to the 7 pm show. Ordering tickets online was easy and I was able to get us front seats on the aisle. Aisle seats in the lower section is the best way to see this show! The dancers come into the aisle so you can see the amazing costumes and makeup up close. Since we were in the front row, we got to see everything so clearly and at the end of the show got to high-five most of the performers. 

The show has great dancing, the amazing Cirque tricks everyone goes to these shows to see and awe at, and all the Michael Jackson hits you want to hear. The hologram MJ is awesome, but my favorite part of the show is the finale with Black and White. I was literally dancing on my way out of the theater.

For MJ fans, and even non-fans, I highly recommend this show. It was the highlight of my Vegas trip!"
MJ One,"Such a great show and tribute to an amazing artist and talent! Love you MJ!
My friends and I were so pumped to see this, I actually had no idea there was such a show, and when I heard it was Cirque de Soleil I knew I and to go! It was my dear BFFs birthday and perfect way to celebrate her birthday! 

The total package of this show I will never forget. From the gift shop, (they are selling the glowing glove!) to his rare memorabilia, photos, ambience, the music, dancing, visuals, costumes..everything! All of the ushers, ticket takers and bartenders are all wearing MJ costumes too! The energy was amazing and the songs were just beautiful. Cameras are not allowed, during the show which is totally understandable. But it doesnt matter you will not want to miss this show. A photographer will take your photo with your party before the show which you can view at a table afterwards. The photo was kinda ehhh and very expensive, but that has nothing to do with the show. 

I found myself and everyone in the audience singing along. Theres nothing to say, MJ has been such a great performer all his life this show just paid an awesome tribute to it. The whole production was so phenomenal there were a few times I felt tears of pure appreciation. Great job Cirque, such an awesome show. Im sure MJ is up there smiling at this!"
MJ One,"Absolutely positively the best show that I have ever seen in my life!  Made you feel like Michael Jackson came back from the dead!  My only criticism is that I would have loved to see Remember The Time performed, but seeing Thriller performed live more than made up for it!!!"
MJ One,"This show is amazing!!!!  I grew up with MJ, but even if you didnt, you will appreciate the music and realize there was no one like him, and there never will be another.  And that thought was kinda sad.  But they did an amazing job with this show.  Not as acrobatic as other Cirque shows, but there is enough.  At first I thought the story, with the kids was a little corny, but it brought it together at the end.  Dirty Diana-wow!  Man in the Mirror was emotional, but happy at the same time.  I will go see this show again."
MJ One,Ive seen this show three times now and it never gets old. I love it! First of all I love Michael Jackson &amp; the Jackson 5. I saw other reviews that say LOVE the Beatles CDS is way better well I beg to differ. They both are good but I love the music from MJ way better (more my time). The acrobatics and usual cirque stunts were amazing!!  The dancers were so good too! Theres even a hologram of MJ doing man in the mirror with the other dancers around him dancing with him and its just something Ive never seen before. The pole dancer that dances to dirty Diana is just breathtaking and impressive to say the least!! I was just in awe most of this show!! If u see one show in Vegas make sure this is the one! I will definitely be back to see it again!
MJ One,"I had very high expectations for this show after reading all the great reviews.   There were some great effects, emotional moments, great dancing and of course the MJ music played on a good sound system, but I couldnt help feeling slightly disappointed even though I really enjoyed the show.  I felt disengaged at some points but as this is a new show, maybe it will be tweaked.

 My bf on the other hand absolutely loved this show and rated it higher than Beatles Love, his previous fav Cirque show.  I think I prefer Love, with MJ One a close second."
MJ One,"OMFG. We loved it so much! 

Non stop action, surprises, MUSIC! There was one particular segment that really melts  even the coldest of heart which was one of my favorites. There is really isnt a single part that was more better than the other. Theres just no words. Just go get your ticket and watch this amazing show!"
MJ One,"This show had lots of very talented performers. However, you may not be overly impressed if you are not a fan of Michaels music. Im not the biggest fan, so I was a bit less excited about this show."
MJ One,"A stunning journey of sound, history, and legacy, Michael Jackson ONE certainly lives up to the expectations of diehard MJ fans. The music is authentic, the production is delicate, and the theme is a triumph. This is a must-see from Cirque du Soleil when you hit Vegas. 

The music is impeccable; every single sound comes from MJ and his work. Imagine MJs original voice recording on IMAX quality output. It feels as if you were listening to him live. 

The theme is a triumph: extolling the king, embodiment of the immortal. This is shown by the arrangement: no one can singly represent the King. It is the culmination of the entire cast and audience that renders MJs presence.  We are the same, we are ONE. 

The symbolism of MJs glove, hat, and socks is empowering, because the objects represent the legacy that is visible to the eyes and tangible to the touch. I really love it.  

You will notice the original dance moves are shown last in the choreography of each song. Instead of presenting a blatant imitation, the choreography gracefully conveys the message, We want to dance like the King. Creativity and freshness dance on stage. 

Interestingly, there is also the element of rebuttal against the media. On the injustice of social media, I cannot empathize more with MJ. I was glad the show touches on that aspect of MJs life. 

All I am trying to say is, if you love MJ, you will enjoy the show. 

On the down side, I was only half-impressed by the acrobatics. Some acts hit the plateau rather quickly as the movements become repetitive. Some lack the grace and difficulty. On a few occasions, you could tell the performers were trying too hard to match the beats. Some performances, such as stick fighting, are extraneous, while the over-presence of the popper and guitar player suggests a limited cast. In a nutshell, this is not fully a circus show, a concert, or a dance show. This is MJ. 

You are paying for the beautiful production. The level of details, the authenticity, the nuanced themes, and the empowering message give all the reasons to live through this hour-and-half of immortality with the King."
MJ One,"This show was very good.  I was super excited to attend the show given all of the 5-star reviews.  while it is definitely good and I recommend it, I gave it 4 stars as it is more of a dance type show and less Cirque even more so then Love at Mirage.  I have to say I LOVE Love at Mirage.  We have seen that show 5+ times.  While this show was quite good, I feel like they used several songs that were not part of the mainstream catalog.  That said there were several gems during the show including dirty diana, smooth criminal, billy jean, and several other numbers.  If you like Michael Jacksons catalog as I do and you dont mind that there is a bit less Cirque then I would say 5-stars all the way.  it is very well done.  But if you are expecting a lot of acrobatics or you want more of that I would recommend another Cirque show.  I think Love at Mirage is a better blend of Cirque and music.  

One other thing to note. I grew up in the late 80s and 90s and I have to say looking back on this era through the music and the videos shown I realized I didnt really like that time very much.  Perhaps reliving this is what caused me to feel a bit meh about the show (in all fairness).  Whereas with Love I never lived through that time and it was more interesting.  I felt like I was watching a bit of a retrospective that I didnt really enjoy.

Lastly, if you have sensitive ears bring ear plugs this show is LOUD.  I know it is meant to be but I have sensitive ears and my ears hurt afterward as I forgot ear plugs. Trust me even with ear plugs in you will hear everything quite well.  

Overall a great production, excellent visuals and definitely recommend but just know what you are getting and know that it is less Cirque acrobatics."
MJ One,"Take this review and meager 2 stars with a grain of salt. I sat in a theater FULL of people who loved this show, but if youre like me (and my date) you could be disappointed - so this review might be useful to you.  Were fans of Cirque du Soleil and Michael Jackson so this seemed like a home run.  Bear in mind, we had just seen O the previous evening.  For us, One didnt compare to the kind of Cirque experience we enjoy - especially for the price.  The circus acts were a tad underwhelming - lacking the daring, audacity, and imagination were used to seeing from Cirque.  There are a couple acrobatic highlights like trampolines on an urban set, but nothing groundbreaking. Otherwise, hat jugglers, martial arts-ish displays (complete with cultural appropriation), and a pole dancer made the experience feel more like a street performance than a night at a show. The acts also felt a little forced into a Michael Jackson theme.  The show didnt seem to have a lot of cohesion.  Now for the Michael elements:  The music is great. Hey, its Michael.  Youll find yourself tapping your toe along with the rest of the audience.  That said, you quickly realize these are circus performers, not great dancers - which is common (even charming) in other Cirque shows, but is a problem when it comes to Michael Jackson choreography.  Jackson choreography requires a certain flare, conviction and precision that was lacking in One.  Dont get me wrong, the dancers were good and theyre all talented - but Michael would never have let his backup dancers phone it in like we saw.  The dancing just wasnt sharp - but hey, it reminded me why Michael was so great: Not everyone can do what he did.  Also, sit in the upper level.  We were in the 4th row.  There was so much smoke that we often couldnt even see the acts.  Warning: Theres also fake snow.  If you dont want to get wet, stay out of the front rows.  For me, it was neither a great concert experience, nor a great circus show.  However, if you love MJ, and are looking for a tribute show (like an Elvis tribute), this could be up your alley."
MJ One,"Was a great show powered by great music.  Definitely gets your blood flowing and body moving.  Enjoyed all the choreography, especially the light suits.  Minor annoyances were the strobe and spotlights that shine into the audience, some were really intense in the eyes during parts of the show.  Other would be late arrivers.  Was seated in a row with 2x different groups of folks coming in late.

Other than those minor items, loved the show and we all left with smiles on our faces!"
MJ One,"This was an incredible show.  The music of Michael Jackson presented with a Cirque du Soleil touch.  The energy flowed throughout the show and contained all the amazing features that you come to expect from Cirque du Soleil.  If you were a fan of the King of Pop, youll enjoy the show.  We were able to enjoy the entire show, since our seats were dead center."
MJ One,"I saw the world tour version first and then saw this show.
It is pretty fun and exciting. Best part is the music. Since MJs songs are very touching w/strong messages, this whole show contains very cool flow.
Usually most of Cirque du Soleil shows have a boring moment at some point, but ONE doesnt. Good show for first timers as well. Personally I like the World Tour Immortal more than this.
Most seats are pretty good. I got 101 Row M. This theater is not giant, so you can go with medium priced seats unless you get the back corner."
MJ One,"Big MJ and Jackson fan here, and the show did not disappoint. Few things to mention:

Pro:

The music selection was diverse enough to transition well

The theater was intimate and acoustics good. 

One featured dancer is quite flexible with a pole! 

Con: 

It was way too damn cold!!! To the point of knocking off a star, as I was often too uncomfortable. Pulled me out of the performance. 

Featured dancer used too much, took away from some of his neat tricks to see them again.

The guitar player was also used too much and was annoying. 

Ushers did not hold people from coming nonstop through the aisles during the songs. They need to make them wait for breaks in the show."
MJ One,"You know the songs, you know the moves, now you must see the show! Michael is no longer here and yet his one show is the best show to see in Vegas. I spent about $160.00 per ticket and it was worth every penny. No you dont have to be a fan to love this show, its that good. I will be seeing it again for sure!"
MJ One,The show was incredible tonight. Just came out of the show with a dropped jaw. Especially the dancer with the blue hair. Anyone know her name? I think I found the love of my life. I like sushi and long walks on the beach. Call me
MJ One,"I really wanted to love the show but unfortunately did not. Dont get me wrong, it was very entertaining but it did not make it onto my list of favorite cirque shows. I expected it to have more dancing vs. acrobatics given its a MJ performance but the dancing parts were just meh. Its still a show thats worth seeing once though."
MJ One,"I absolutely loved this new Cirque show...it ranks up there with Love and Mystere as my favorite Cirque show in Vegas!  It was such a great tribute to Michael and my favorites songs were Billy Jean, Man in the Mirror and Thriller - how cool!  This is truly a production and you dont want to miss it while visiting Las Vegas.  I was fortunate enough to go to a private showing and the company that hosted it launched their new brand...pretty cool for their big announcement!"
MJ One,"One word..AMAZING!!! This show was the highlight of my trip to Vegas. Well done Cirque du Soleil! Worth every penny, not a bad seat in the place! I would definitely watch this again!! Dont miss it!!!"
MJ One,"It was good. Not the best Cirque de Solei show. Good music and dancing. Lots of his songs were played. This was the first Cirque music show I have seen. I prefer their traditional shows. Mystere, O, Zarkana etc..."
MJ One,"I, and the three people with whom I saw this show, are mystified as to why there are so many rave reviews of this show.

I am a huge Cirque du Soleil fan. When our group decided at the last minute to see this show, I wondered out loud, How are they going to build a Cirque show around Michael Jacksons music? Answer: they didnt. 

Whats great about Cirque is the acrobatics. The athleticism, the danger, the displays of strength, the grace -- thats what every Cirque show I have seen  has in common. In this hour and a half show, there were only about four acrobatic acts. They were great, but not awe-inspiring as in O. The rest of the show was poorly choreographed dancing and lots of special effects and lasers. The music was loud and the action frenetic. Not that Cirque shows need to be erotic, but this also was completely scrubbed of any sex appeal at all. And at one point, everything came to a stop and a poor-quality early MJ video played, in its entirety, on the scrim. For that I paid $170?

Based on the number of great reviews, and the standing ovation this act received, my opinion is clearly in the minority. But be warned: if you go to this show expecting and hoping for the elements that make a classic Cirque show magical, you too will be sorely disappointed."
MJ One,"This was an awesome show. My whole family loved it. From our 6 year old daughter to our 76 year old mom, they were on the edge of their seats the entire time and loved every minute of it. Only recommend getting tickets in the 200 sections. We bought tickets late &amp; was in the second row from the stage, section 103 B row, and was looking up most of the time &amp; some of the show was happening behind us. But you did get to see up close of how outstanding the performers were right in front of you. Standing ovation all around for all the performers and the entire show."
MJ One,"With all of these 5 star ratings Im wondering if I saw the same show they did.  It was average, at best, and anyone that feels this is show is better than Love is easily amused.  Theater design is horrible, Im 6 2 and still couldnt see over the person in front of me.  First half of show was very boring, only a few highlights in the second half.  Wont go again, although have been to Love at least 3 times."
MJ One,Get tickets and go to this show! Music is choreographed brilliantly with floor to ceiling video projections and world class dancer gymnasts. There is even an amazing hologram of MJ. I dont normally like Vegas shows and go begrudgingly. I actually want to see this again!
MJ One,"I dont think there was a bad seat in the auditorium.  A tad too much lights for me in the beginning, however, the sound and dancing were great throughout.  Didnt really understand the story they were trying to tell and they probably dont even need one (everyone is there for the music, dancing and acrobats).  Acrobatics also amazing.  Best part was the Thriller montage.  Seeing 1 time is enough for me as the price is pretty steep."
MJ One,"We went here for the second time this past spring break.  The first time was for our anniversary.  This time it was a family trip.  Both times we sat front center.  There has been talk about whether the front row provides the best seats....yes it does.  The only issue is the smoke, which there is a lot of.  Its more of a mist than a smoke, but is irritating nonetheless.  In terms of the show.  Its amazing.  This time there was a Thriller performance that was excellent.  I dont think it was I place the first time around.  Overall, a highly recommended show for family or date night."
MJ One,"Very entertaining show!

I would have given the show 5 stars, but I had to remove 1 star away because the show is WAY TOO LOUD. The bass is cranked up to max in this theater. And this is coming from someone who is into edm and attends a fair amount of edm festivals each year.

There is more dancing in this show than most cirque shows. They add a bit of the cirque element to each act, but dont expect to see a Michael Jackson version of Mystere on stage. 

The theater was completely packed when I went to see the show. I would recommend sitting towards the center and as close to the stage as you want to spend. This show is not cheap and there are no discounts available at the moment like many of the other cirque shows playing in Las Vegas."
MJ One,OMG. I cried from beginning to end. this was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen. SO WELL DONE and so worth the price of the tickets. GO SEE THIS SHOW IMMEDIATELY!!
MJ One,"immediate reminder of what this world is missing w/o michael jackson.  show was great, artists were amazing.  Wished it was the kind of show where dancing in your seat is allowed, but this is vegas I guess.  came out with one word...love."
MJ One,"Show was awesome! Enjoyed every minute of it especially when they did MJ hologram. It was well choreographed. The 4 stars and the MJ impersonator made the show. I was entertained from start to finish. If you havent seen it, its a must. If you have a choice between MJ One and MJ Live, go to MJ One, its worth the money!"
MJ One,"I love MJ. His music, performances, dancing, choreography, sets, colors the whole deal. 

I love cirque. I have loved their performances in Vegas and around the country.

One is their worst show. 
Lighting - we were squinting with the lasers flashing in our eyes throughout the show. 
Music - WAY TOo LOUD. I had read people asking to get ear plugs, I thought they were joking! Nope u need it. 
Dancing - 2 acts were great  the way u make me feel and their closing act with 1 guy.  The MJ hologram was more cirque level of quality, the lit up men in the dark was great . But like someone else said most of the time people r just running in n out. 

If MJ is on their screen I just found myself looking at him n not the dancers becoz he was something else. 

I honestly felt like asking for a refund for the 130$ ( discounted ticket) 

Waste of my time n money."
MJ One,Amazing show! We took our two teenaged sons and they really enjoyed it as well. The cirque performers were amazing and the technology used throughout was impressive. Definitely worth the money!
MJ One,We saw this show last night and I loved it!!! It made me sad though because Michael is gone. Must see!! Great tribute to him!
MJ One,INCREDIBLE.... the show was a very very entertaining the way they put Michael in as a hologram was so touching even beyond that the production was awesome
MJ One,"Pros: great music of course, slack line performers, LED &amp; hologram scenes, acrobatics, gift shop, Thriller scene, Stranger in Moscow w/ pole dancing

Cons: story line (what was up with those group of kids?!), repetitive slow parts that felt mashed together w/ pointless performances, the lead guitarists costume (wtf is that about)

Overall we enjoyed the show but we just didnt feel MJs presence like we did during the Michael Jackson Immortal world tour we caught in Chicago. I knew not to expect the same production but was hoping for the same magic. Solid B rating"
MJ One,I cant say enough great things about this show.  We loved it!  It was definitely the highlight of our time in Vegas.  The actors were phenomenal.  It was our first Cirque Du Soleil show and we were very impressed.  We cant wait to see the others!  The special effects were amazing.  I would see it again without hesitation.
MJ One,Not for MJ fans only. Not for Cirque fans only. Bar none the best show on the strip. Awe inspiring and beautiful.
MJ One,"I had been waiting a long long long time to see this show, so I was really psyched to get the chance to see it during a stop over in LV. 
I mean, seriously.... for a dancer like myself I am in LOVE with two of the most talented Jackson siblings and have been since I could bust a move in my diapers. Cirque du Soleil and Michael Jackson music together? I was more than excited.

So..........

Lets just say that the performers are always talented, and that I respect the hard work that they do and although this particular show did NOT have many of the infamous wild acrobatic stunts as other Cirque shows do, they, in my eyes, are always entertaining.  This review is not in any way a reflection upon them. At ALL. After all, they did not choreograph this.... this...show.
That being said... I was very disappointed.
I dont know what I was expecting.  Dancing? Some choreographed awesome numbers with a set design that would blow my head back in awe?
What I was NOT expecting, is that most of this show, was on a SCREEN, just like Madonnas re-invention tour. Bleh.  If I wanted to pay over $200.00 for watching a screen entertain me for a bit, I would have bought a flatscreen TV and stuck my nose right up to it.  Needless to say, I was more impressed with the acrobatics that actually were in the show.
I did not expect to see a hologram of Michael Jackson and that was pretty cool, dont get me wrong... it just felt like... well.. how can I explain this...  I guess once you have seen O, everything else is kind of a let down in comparison. Even LOVE, was not as thrilling and emotionally charging as O to me... maybe its just me... 
although Man in the Mirror made me tear up, and I do love my Michael, seeing him as a hologram just made me sad, and remember how much I admired him and would watch his behind the scenes documentaries on his dancing. 

Its always a good time at a cirque show though.... so please dont let my so-so review stop you from going to see this show.  I just have been spoiled by other cirque shows and Im forever ruined.  ;)"
MJ One,"I found the show extremely disappointing.  First and most importantly,  the dancers could NOT dance.  Maybe this was because it was Monday night,  and the regular dancers had the day off,  but they were not very good at all.  Secondly,  this was not a typical cirque show.  The acrobatics were simplistic,  and not on the level of any cirque show I have seen. There was no one actually playing Michael Jackson.  It was like videos set to Micheal Jacksons music,  without Michael Jackson.  The two ladies next to us left 20 minutes into the show.  After an hour,  we couldnt take anymore,  and we got up and left.  Very expensive,  and a total waste of money."
MJ One,"Loved it rocked out to all the songs and dazzled by the the dancing and movment. My first cds show,, maybe not full acrobatics but the music and movement are awsome. Would see again!"
MJ One,If your a fan of Michael Jackson this is a must see. Im not going to spoil it for anyone but its a must see. It was a visual orgy of colors stunts and music. Truly an amazing show.
MJ One,This show is incredible!!!! I recommend everyone in Vegas to see this!!!!!!! Its just so wonderful. There arent enough words to describe or explain it!!!! Just go see it! The people who put this on and perform are marvelous and genius!!
MJ One,"This is the only CdS show I saw during my trip to Vegas. My hubby is a fan, so we decided to see this one instead of O. Both of us werent impressed. We love the songs, the clarity of the sounds, our seats, but we expected more acts/acrobats. There were a lot of dancing; a little more than I like.   I understand MJ is a great dancer so they want to focus on that. But I paid $200/ticket, so I expected and wanted more from the show."
MJ One,"Wow. Just, wow. This show exceeded all expectations I had going in. Of course it helps if you are an MJ fan, but even if youre not there is so much to love about this Cirque performance. It was a packed theatre, but no bad seats...a definite must see for Vegas visitors."
MJ One,"Oh my goodness this show AMAZED ME! There was amazing lighting, crazy good acrobats, speakers IN THE SEATS, and a really cool story behind Michael Jackson and four kids who protect the magic of Michael Jackson. I highly recommend this show for all ages. I would say that 5 and under should sit with their parents."
MJ One,"Wow! What an amazing show ! Music was incredible , amazing sound system inside the theatre ! Sat in the upper back , but still good seating."
MJ One,I have seen this show about 5 times now and it gets better every time. It seems that they changed the roles of the misfits some and it really has improved the show. I will contine seeing this show two-3 time a year as long as it is in Vegas.
MJ One,Blew me away. Fun cocktails and popcorn before you enter . There is a tram from Excalibur to Mandalay bay. Interactive performance.  Plus if you get there early enough and the show isnt sold out they move you up! We got the cheapest tickets but they generously moved us front and center. By far best show in vegas.
MJ One,Loved this show. Amazing! The lighting effects were outstanding. You dont even have to love Michael Jackson to enjoy this show.
MJ One,Great show it is incredible how they perform. I am not a huge Michael Jackson fan but I do know all of his old music and they played a lot of it. The place was packed. The best performance was Billie Jean probably because that is one of my favorite songs of his. I thought they were just going to play it and move on but wait there is more. If you are short or no more then 53 ish sit back with your head on the seat rests you will hear so much from the seats through the entire performance. It is incredible. Many people probably do not realize this. Good show highly recommend even though it is a bit pricey.
MJ One,My wife and I saw the 9:30 pm show last evening. Unbelievable choreography and athletic dance routines along with Cirque du Solei acrobatics.  Seats were extremely comfortable and the sight lines were good. The lighting and sound were excellent as well. I left the theater sad that we had lost such an incredible talent at such a young age.  We enjoyed this production immensely and recommend it highly.
MJ One,"You dont have to be a MJ fan to love this show!

Saw this show last Saturday night. Sat in Row G so we were pretty close to the stage. Music loud but no problems hearing the songs (each headrest has own speaker so you can hear the background singers). Dancing like watching live MJ videos and the acrobatics fabulous. Like other Cirque shows, the acrobatics are perfectly synced to the music. 

We saw The Beatles Love show last time we were in Las Vegas and this is just as good (the theme, music and decade drives the acrobatic routines). 

Must see for anyone who loves the King Of Pop but even grandparents will love the show!"
MJ One,"My sister and I saw this show in September.  I love MJ.  I dont think the show did him justice but it was still ok.  I would have preferred it a bit more personnel.  It was pretty much the same thing throughout, same dancers, change of set here and there...but not a fabulous show.  But worth one visit if you have nothing better to do and you like MJ."
MJ One,Excellent show. Dont worry if you have seats all the way in the back. There are no obstructed views and the rows slope down.
MJ One,"This was my first cirque show. It had less acrobatics, Ive been told than other cirque shows. But I went with three others and we all loved it. its michael jackson..whats not to love.Cant wait for my next show!"
MJ One,"We have seen most of the shows in Vegas and were excited to to see something different I heard that this show was good from a friend of mine but it exceeded all my expectations. I am not a huge Michael Jackson fan, but who doesnt like him and appreciates his music. We had fairly good seats in the front but the auditorium is large and open as the set up is such that the show can be seen really well from all angles and levels. The show was a Cirque du Soleil show and the acrobatics did not disappoint but what impressed me was the storyline of the show and how the dancing went really well with all the songs and really reminded me of Michael Jacksons talents. It also got emotional when they showed him as a child and played some of his music from the olden days. A lot of people in the auditorium where actually crying at some point. There were a couple of very small mistakes including some lights not showing up but there was so much action going on all the time that the mistakes went by unseen by most. The show is about two hours and is very action filled and incorporates the whole auditorium. Definitely one of the best, if not the best show I have seen in Vegas. A must see for everyone"
MJ One,"Unfortunately this show was NOT cirque at ALL!  If you wanna pay $150 for animation, a hologram of Michael Jackson, and a WHOLE lot dancing, then go for it.  But if you are looking for the amazement of acrobatic performances you wont get it here.  You are better off watching THIS IS IT on a giant big screen TV.  I love Michael but you pay that kind of Money when hes alive to give you the real thing."
MJ One,Meh!  Its good music and dancing but thats pretty much it. It is NOTHING compared to the innovativess and atheletism exhibited by other Cirque shows and ive seen about six between Vegasand New York. O is still the best!
MJ One,"This was not one of Cirques best shows. Cirque is known for its quality. Do not expect much of the top level acrobatics here...which was not my problem with the show. The show was not well organized as it moved from one song to the next. Lots of high and low songs were pieced together. I understand that Cirque was trying to manage everyones mood but the performances could have been scheduled with more thoughtfulness. This show could easily be reduced to 45 minutes, rearranged.. and leave audience wanting a little more. Instead most of us couldnt wait for the performances to end although we loved MJ songs! Its a pity! Watch the Beatles show instead, this show does not live up to MJs image and leaned on the tacky side."
MJ One,"Very disappointing. If you are a Cirque fan you will be very disappointed. We are Cirque fans and go to as many of their shows as possible. This should not be billed as a Cirque show. Im a huge fan of loud music, but the volume level of the sound system was so high that it took away from the experience - sounds like a strange thing to say... To their credit it was an incredible sound system to be able to create that volume with excellent clarity, just so loud that it was painful - I was anxious for it to end. The lighting was poorly produced so that many times you would be blinded by spot lights hitting you square in the eyes. The story line was strange - not in a Cirque type of strange, but in a Im a computer gamer / Tron sort of strange. It was missing the usual artistic creativity you come to expect with the brand. 

Conversely we saw the Beatles Show at the Mirage two days before and it was fantastic and would highly recommend."
MJ One,"We love cirque shows. By far the best one weve been to! Entire experience remarkable. Performers top of the top! Love the singing chanteuse on the moon. The killer guitar player hot badass blonde!! Sexy fabulous dancers and acrobats. Sound system, seat speakers. With such a huge catalog-the creators song choices are phenomenal!!! Thriller given such an incredible interpretation ! Would totally see again. If youre a Michael fan just go, youll feel his spirit and love there. Love the nod to Janet-shes iconic too!!"
MJ One,"Huge disappointment!!  From the start it was way too loud, music was crazy hard driving and the lights were blinding.  Couldnt see the stage unless I leaned over to the side because the person in front of me blocked my view and she was short!.  And then didnt even care to see the stage after seeing a street dancer perform a couple of songs.  Waited through 8 songs hoping it would get better before finally walking out.  Its unbelievable that this show is playing at The Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas."
MJ One,"Its 4.5 stars but well round it up!  I havent been to a Cirque du Soleil show in a while and the last one I went to O, was good but not great.  If youre a fan of MJ you have to come.  Even if youre not a fan you have to come.  I think it goes without saying, they play his songs and do a lot of dancing and incorporate a lot of the acrobatic stuff that Cirque du Soleil usually has.  Some of the stuff they did was really cool particularly when they danced to Beat It on a dark stage with their lighted up costumes.  The costumes would change colors, move from one performer to another.  Im not doing it any good by trying to describe it so the best thing for you to do is to come and check it out.  The theater isnt that big so the seats are all pretty good.  We sat near the front on the side and had a great view.  Anyway if youll do one show in Vegas, do this one."
MJ One,"Wow. This show was awesome. If your an MJ fan, you definitely have to check this one out. Best Cirque show. My friend and I bought our tickets the evening before the show, and paid about $120 each. 
I dont remember where our seats were supposed to be originally but they were far back. Since we got there early, one of the ushers escorted us to new seats that were about 10 rows from the front right in the center! That was nice. Everyone, from the bartenders to the ushers to the photographers were rocking these really cool blazer jackets. I was hoping to purchase one after the show in the gift shop but they were not for sale. They did however have unique hoodies, tees, and tanks for the ladies in their gift shop.
The show played most of MJs major hits. The dancers were on point and very talented. Shoutout to Jenyne performing the Dirty Diana dance. Shes amazing!"
MJ One,This was one of the best shows that I have seen in Las Vegas. It ranks up there with O.
MJ One,Pretty good show but not as polished as some Cirque shows I have seen.  Jugglers are not supposed to drop their hats for example.  Great entertainment overall but needed a little more flow.  I think its a bit overpriced for what you get but worth seeing if you have the chance.
MJ One,the really enjoyed the show. Like any circus show there is so much going on to catch it at all but its definitely worth seeing it again.
MJ One,"where do I start..... I have been a huge fan of Cirque ...... and seen virtually all 30 shows.....
second I think Michael Jackson was a one of a kind talent..... that being said this show was in the bottom third of the Cirque series...Michaels music was butchered to give it a techno sound.... the weird wizard of Oz voiceover added nothing.
When they left his music alone and provided the appropriate act.... thats when it was at its best....
The plot was horrible......... and now for a first for me...... not a single act was a jaw dropping, how do they do that moment......

lastly.... a 35 dollar swing per ticket between the last row and 4 from the last is not worth it....

see this as a last resort.... and do not judge all the Cirque quality by this show....

PS: hologram was cool..."
MJ One,"I have seen over 17 Cirque shows, but the Michael Jackson One show is one of the BEST Cirque Du Solelil shows I have EVER seen (close call with O at Bellagio). This show has everything - amazing acts, great music, non stop action and sensory overload. It makes you dance, cry and will definitely leave you amazed. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is a Cirque or MJ fan. What a tribute! MJ would be proud."
MJ One,"I was so excited watching this show.. I love the interaction of the performers with the audience.. They kept the crowed entertained. The show is full of surprises.. Yes, youll want to dance.. I highly recommend it.. And if you are a fan, you gotta go!"
MJ One,"This is an extraordinary experience from start to end. High energy world class entertainment. Im no MJ fan, but grew up in the 1980s so I appreciate the magnitude of his impact  on music and pop culture. The flow of the show was perfect. No dull moments. No clock watching. As much I love Beatles music and enjoyed  Cirque LOVE, I think this was even better.  Worth the $120, no doubt about it."
MJ One,"This show is fun and it definitely makes you sing a long with it. I love the visuals, sound, and the performers interaction with the audience. The only thing that didnt make it a full 5 stars was...okay, its a Michael Jackson show. I dont care how small or big of a show it is...its Michael Jackson. I had high expectations out of the performers. I expected all of the performers to be perfection. I mean, its Michael, right? But a few of the performers, you could just tell they were not into it, especially in the beginning. You could differentiate which performers put their whole heart and soul into executing their moves and the ones who half-assed it. Them not being in sync did not give the whole wow factor I was expecting. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the show. Bad was one of my favorites, and of course, Thriller. Definitely would recommend it but I hope the performers are all on the same page this time lol!"
MJ One,"i should first say that i am a ginormous fan of mj.
i love love love love love love love (you get the point) michael jackson.
i grew up listening and dancing to his music.
many of his songs resonate through my life and are nostalgic to me.
there are few songs that i dont know but love them as well, nonetheless.
he can do no wrong, as far as im concerned, and i mourn his absence all the time.
i knew going in that i was going to love this show.

i am one of the unfortunate few that never had a chance to see him perform live while he was still with us.
i regret that.
this is probably the closest ill ever get and during the man in the mirror performance, i wept.
the way they projected him onto the stage was magical and really felt like he was there with us.

the dancers, acrobats, clowns and musicians were all fantastic.
i have a deep respect for the cirque du soleil performers and the lifetime of hard work that goes into perfecting their craft.
this show properly represented the artist that was michael jackson extremely well while also showcasing the amazing talent of the cirque performers.
i would see this show again and again."
MJ One,"This show by far is my favorite.  Fsntastic, awesome, well organized.  Worth every penny!!! Never a dull moment!!"
MJ One,"Great show! I just want to add some critiques is all..first the 4 Explorers who ran around the stage made no sense???what was the point of them,,second the female guitar player with the rocker wig on,,again made no sense, sometimes she was out there and she wasnt even really playing the guitar,,third it would have been better if they chronolojically played his music, starting from the early 70s Jackson 5 stuff and ending with his 2003 realease of Butterflies,,the music presented was wall over the map from his hits of 83 to 95 back to 87,,and last I know it cant play ALL of his music, but favorties like Say, say, say, Rock with You, The Girl is Mine, and a few others were  omitted, but otherwise a very good show!"
MJ One,Ive seen many shows in Vegas and this is one of the best.  Cirque de Soliel has done an Awesome job in creating a Beautiful tribute to Michael Jackson.  I would definitely see this again.  They had music from his childhood into his adult life/music career.  Dont leave Vegas without seeing this show.
MJ One,"This is an amazing tribute to an amazing artist! I want to download the MJ music now! An expensive show but definitely worth the money to get prime seats.  Sit in the first row of the second level as its interactive and this way you dont miss a thing! I am not a cirque fan, they didnt even tell me it was cirque based before I came but I didnt fall asleep in this cirque (like i have 3 of the 4 others I have seen) and I was quite entertained. They put on a show like MJ himself would have! 
Thriller and Man in the Mirror were my favorites performed but all of it was fantastic! Audience was entralled and the effects were wonderful! Lots of dancing and special effects compared to acrobatics which was nice!  
My only question is: when did they start serving popcorn and M&amp;Ms during show productions?!?!?!?! 
You can tell the performers enjoyed themselves and the costume design and backstage people did a great job. Great team effort by all! Definitely 5 stars!"
MJ One,"My husband really wanted to see this show, so I said what the heck, lets do it! And OMG, Im so glad we went!  This show was absolutely amazing!  We were seated in the second row from the stage,  so it made the experience even better! It was live the whole time,  and kept us dancing in our seats! This is a must see!"
MJ One,"Very disappointed in this Cirque Du Soleil MJ production, I ve been to other Cirque Du Soleil shows and this one has to be the worse.  Im not sure why this has such a high review on Yelp, not worth watching, we left early, there are certainly other better shows I ve seen by Cirque Du Soleil.  The show just did not come together well at all, nothing special other than some so so acrobatics and of course ur classic MJs songs."
MJ One,"My wife and I visit Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year and this was our 33rd trip there. Needless to say we have seen countless shows and thought this would be a good choice to include in our November visit. Wrong. This was hands down the worst show we have ever seen in Vegas. We paid well over $200 per ticket and had great seats. A total waste of time and money. We almost walked out more than once. The irritation began before the show even started with trenchcoat wearing cast members running through the audience yelling and jumping up to scare people while flashing cameras in our faces. The show itself consisted of a chaotic plot performed to bad versions of Michael Jackson songs. The sound quality was terrible and the music selection consisted of way too many second rate Jackson songs. The glove skating around the stage was cute and amusing at first, but was way overdone and became tiresome by the end. A few songs were sung by a woman sitting on a suspended fake moon so it forced the audience to repeatedly gaze into the ceiling. Several times during the show there were no performers on stage as we were reduced to watching some old MTV music videos of Michael Jackson performances on a giant screen. At one point we were subjected to watching a cartoon for several minutes! We never appreciate being subjected to the social values of performers and this show reeked of social messaging. We always enjoyed Michael Jackson and his music, but the entire mood of the show was dark and angry. One song centered around the sexual harassment of the female lead singer. Almost every scene included a fight of some kind. Background videos included images of Hitler, swastikas and protest demonstrations. Do we really need this on a night out for fun? One video segment included the firing of automatic weapons. Not a good idea to have gunshots ring out in a theater considering the recent shooting incident in this very hotel. Did they forget that the massacred concert goers initially thought the gunshots were a part of the show? Midway through the show the lights came on and an announcement was made that it is necessary at this time to interrupt the show, but please stay in your seats with no further explanation. We didnt know what to think. Is this a good idea considering the recent massacre? Should we duck? Pretty irresponsible way to provide the crew with some time to reset the stage behind a closed curtain.  In summation this was a poorly planned and poorly executed and offensive show that exhibited terrible discretion with a total lack of deference to the recent alarming events that took place in this hotel. In my opinion the producers did almost nothing right.  A shameful spectacle.  The only worthwhile part of the entire show was the hologram of Michael Jackson. I must say that was very impressive.  Do yourself a favor and go see Donny &amp; Marie or the Bronx Wanderers."
MJ One,Awesome!  My favorite part was Billie Jean!  Anyone would be entertained by this show. If you enjoy his music - it is a must see.
MJ One,"By far the best Cirque show Ive seen.  I even saw it twice!  The effects are stunning, the dancing and acrobatics obviously are very impressive.  But it brought back so many happy memories with all the wonderful music.

Even if you dont know much about MJ, you will feel the magic, I promise.

WOW, ultra wow.  Do not miss this. Please notice that Ive seen 4 other Cirques (maybe more), this one made me feel the best."
MJ One,"Save your money.  I grew up with Michael Jacksons music and this show was awful! It was so boring and kiddish we walked out after 20 mins!  And, the seats where not high enough to look over the person in front of you."
MJ One,"I summarize this in short:  Every element of artistry is explored...music, lights, dancing, acrobatics, acrobatic pole dancing, arial stunts, gymnastics, screen dancing, and even light show costumes.  This show had it all.  In an arena of many cirque shows, and Ive seen 8 this is the best all around show I have seen. Everyone was on there feet at the end.  MUST GO!!"
MJ One,"Truly amazing show. The acrobatic parts are absolutely amazing, the song selection are all of MJs best, and the storyline in general is awesome. I would highly recommend this show to everyone, regardless of if they are an MJ fan or not. I even found myself brought to tears at one point, and I will be the first to admit that even though I liked MJ, he was never my favorite artist. Middle section, back half are probably the best seats because youll be able to see everything. Definitely give this show a chance!"
MJ One,"Where do I start? 

Ive seen most of the Cirque shows in Vegas .  What I love about them is the world they create for you. I respect the Cirque brand.   This little bubble that they create for you to escape to for two hours thats just magic before your eyes. The clever narrative  ... The awe inspiring sets , the intricate costumes,  the entrancing  lighting, the music that envelopes you and transports you through that world seamlessly . I swear I draw so much inspiration with these shows that last night was more than disappointing... It was upsetting 

here you have the perfect subject. The KING of POP. 

You have an incredible story to tell from the ABCs to Thriller.  Much like the Beatles show Love you can really tell a narrative and transport this audience through his music and the impact it had in the time and in the world. Instead they hired non dancers to dance his choreography over and over and over. Not only were they out of sync, they werent even trying to be (which is a direct insult to Michael who was probably one  the greatest dancer of all time) great okay its a cirque show not a dance show... One can point out. Perfect! Then have them doing circus stuff they pulled two tricks thats being done in every circus or strip club for that matter and expect you to be impressed w trampoline jumpers and one pole dancer.... I was in shock at how bad it is. Michael would never let that show represent him. He was a perfectionist. And technically cirque you guys are supposed to be too... You really really dropped the ball with this one. Believe and ONE can be considered your flops. Get back on it.


Dont spend your money on this show. 
It was overpriced hot garbage."
MJ One,Absolutely amazing!!  I cried through the whole show.  Worth every penny!
MJ One,"I just came back from Vegas and from seeing this epic show and I must say it was amazing! It started off a bit slow but by the second or third song it got better and better!! They did about ten to twelve of MJS popular hits and the performances were all stunning. The MJ impersonator was also really good and was in-sync with the hologram they had of Michael for a particular song. My favorite act was Smooth Criminal. They danced to that song well.  The event was sooo worth the money! If yall are ever in Vegas, GO SEE THIS SHOW! Its a must! Oh and one word of advice, the drinks inside the event are very expensive as a thermos sized jug of margarita is $18 :("
MJ One,INCREDIBLE SHOW!  We took our 8 year old daughter and she was in awe!  It is hard to choose whether I liked this one or O better - they are both amazing!  I would really recommend going to see this show if you are in Vegas!
MJ One,"If you can do only one thing in Vegas, go and watch this show!!! Its amazing! I loved it so much! Wonderful performance full of energy, timeless music, choreography and paying attention to details. Every song is done with great professionalism and the whole show will leave you breathless and wanting to go home and turn up MJs music! 5 starts plus show! Go! Dont hesitate for a minute!"
MJ One,"This show was, simply put, amazing. If you enjoy the music of Michael Jackson youll love this show. I highly recommend it is extremely entertaining."
MJ One,"I would looove to give this show 10 stars but unfortunately I HAVE to give them 5. Gee Golly Gosh Wow Batman! Probably the most visually stunning, fun, beautiful, emotionally amazing shows Ive ever seen.  My husband and I wanted to dance the whole and super bummed we couldnt (he totes wanted to be in the show). This was the perfect blend of MJ nostalgia, cirque de soleil magic and amazing acrobatics/dance moves. I already got tickets to see it again.  I sat in row M in the balcony and even though it was far away I had a great view of EVERYTHING. A MUST SEEEEEEEE!!!"
MJ One,"Best Cirque du Soleil show ever. Ive seen almost all of the Cirque du Soleil shows so trust me when I say this is amazing!..Move over Ka, this ONE is epic. If you love MJ, youll love this show. If you love dancing, youll love this show. If you love acrobats, youll love this show. If you love any other Cirque due Soleil shows, youll love this show. If you love magic, youll definitely love this show because the whole thing was just MAGICAL. 

As far as seating goes, we sat ALLL the way in the back and couldnt see very well. My suggestion is to get seats in the middle section. That way you can see dancers on top of your head without straining your neck but its close enough to see dancers on stage too. Plus, it wont break your wallet because front rolls are +200/ea. Also, if youre short, ask them for a booster cushion...forget the embarrassment, youll thank me."
MJ One,"Words can not begin to explain just how AMAZING this show is, literally from beginning to end you are captivated. Inspiring, touching, beautiful and OUT OF THIS WORLD! Must must must see!"
MJ One,"A MUST SEE for all Michael Jackson fans. This show is certainly less acrobatic than the typical Cirque show, but the music and dancing are the BEST!  If you are in Vegas, dont gamble,  go see this show!  You will not be disappointed!"
MJ One,"If you love MJs music and you like acrobatics then I doubt you will find something better than this. I have seen several Cirque De Soleil shows and this one definitely takes the prize. The way they have tied his songs into the act are simply phenomenal. Dont be surprised if you want to go back and see a full repeat because of the visual overload at this show. Get the seats in the center in the mezanine since this show has acts all up above, the sides and then on the stage."
MJ One,"Well...this was an expensive night out, but definitely worth the experience.  While it didnt seem as cirque-y as youd expect from Cirque du Soleil, it packs a massive hit of visual overload that will have you captivated with your jaw dropped throughout the entire performance.  Each act incorporates something new and the whole thing weaves together quite nicely.  I can bore you with my favorite highlights, but I would just be repeating everyone elses comments here.  If you can make, I strongly recommend sitting away from the stage a bit as much of the visual experience incorporates a broad view of the entire set and some of the performances stretch out into the audience.  Oh...the music is pretty good too!"
MJ One,"Im not much of a MJ fan (I dont dislike him, Im just sort of ambivalent towards his stuff) but that has little to do with my rating.   Id give it a 1.5 stars if I could...

Ill just echo what many have said already :  if youre hoping to see a Cirque du Soleil show, you probably wont enjoy this.  This had way more dancing, far less acrobatics.  There were a couple of pieces where there was the beginning of an acrobatic act that made me think OK, about time... here we go but they never materialized.  Pretty disappointing.  If it wasnt advertised as a CdS show, I would probably have had a very different opinion of it.   The theater does have a great sound system, lots of good lighting, etc. but this is not what I was hoping to see."
MJ One,This show is amazing one if the best shows on the strip. Only thing bad about this show is the price. But you get what you pay for. Try your best to get center seating.
MJ One,"great show, awesome outfits, overall a great experience. Some drawbacks include the overall presentation which requires some detail. the staff was friendly and the performance was spot on, of course the music was also. Being seated and leaving the theater were the biggest drawbacks."
MJ One,"This is the only Vegas show that I have left early from. The act seemed more Ringling Brothers than Cirque du Soleil. Unless you are a fanatic Michael Jackson fan that idolizes him as a God, avoid this show."
MJ One,"Ok dont hate. I am a huge MJ fan. The music and dancing were great. As far as saying this is a Cirque show, I dont think so. There were a few acrobat acts and they were no big deal. A few guys juggling hats on their heads. I have seen many Cirque shows and this one misses the mark by a long shot. I took friends to see it because I heard it was good. They hadnt been to Vegas in 40 years. I was so disappointed that I chose this one and not o. No comparison. Do not expect true Cirque from this show. Just a lot of dancing."
MJ One,"I completely agree with 1 star review below.  If you are looking for Cirque du Solei show, this is not for you.  There is NOTHING from what youd expect to see from Cirque du Solei. 
The music is great, the dancing is good.
Id say one/two acts are memorable, the rest feels like so you think you can dance show."
MJ One,"Outstanding!!! I felt like I was going back to my childhood and now, I really miss MJ. Everything was dynamic starting from the music videos, dancing, costumes, acting, and the greatest hits from MJ!! I cant believe I waited so long to see this production. MJ would have been proud. A must see!!!! I"
MJ One,"Saw the show on Sept. 23.  It was cheesy.  Dancers were disappointing, didnt get the characters who appeared throughout the show, played a lot of songs that werent that popular and the acrobatics were just ok- nothing mind blowing.  Overpriced and a big waste of time.  I would have rather blown my $155 at the casino."
MJ One,"Wow.  Even the entrance of the show feels really nice to walk through. The large photos of MJ.  The elevators have awesome frog jacket closure details.  However, the staff at the entrance... One had long hair with the circle glasses, hat, and trench coat. Reminded me more of Boy George lol. I am so happy I had the opportunity to watch this show!  I CRIED!  I realize now if I saw Michael actually perform I would have been a lunatic fan sobbing hysterically. I actually seen IMMORTAL and I was highly disappointed. This show turned that feeling around!   The costumes were really great.  The choreography felt Michael Jackson with just the right touch of cirque.  The soundtrack was a great compilation of my favorites. I love the choreography and tricks on the tight ropes. Cant wait to watch this again!"
MJ One,"Having seen all the other Cirque shows in Vegas many of them multiple times. I was excited to go see this show. I purchased one ticket online for $108 and went to pick it at the box office. When i got into the show they moved from the $108 section to the $150 so it was off to a good start. The theater was beautiful the sound of music was coming from all over. Great sound system
Then the show started and it got worse it was like watching one big Jackson music video with hardly any Cirque acts just dancers. The four characters they used to try to tell some of story where not that talented the two girls skills where juggling a hat and the other girl was some kind of kung fu action scene with a stick? not very entertaining at all. And to make matters worse the show broke down for about 15 minutes while they turned on the house lights and told us to stay put... 
To sum it up there was nothing new there. no refreshing acts I dont think Cirque had a lot of control of it and the Jackson family must have some influence.   
I give it 2 starts because the sets the lighting and the sound where great"
MJ One,"Incredibly entertaining show from start to finish and a worthy tribute to one of the best performers to ever grace the stage. This is one of those shows that youll leave fully satisfied and if you were ever a fan of MJ and his ability as an entertainer, its hard not to walk away feeling emotional. Great music, dancing and acrobatics along with the style and creativity that comes with a Cirque show. Easily one of the best shows Ive seen. Like other reviewers have said, I would suggest sitting further back in the center of the theater. We were 4 rows back from the stage and it was hard to catch everything happening around us. Regardless, the show was the highlight of our trip and I would highly recommend it."
MJ One,"So very disappointing!  I love MJ and Cirque however this was just a mess.  The sound was horrible,  the dancers phone it in. Not the kind of dance energy that MJs dancer s would perform. It was odd, too much going on at once and poorly produced. The best part was the Hologram with  MJ dancing. I think if MJ saw this he would be really upset. This was not representative of the quality of music or dance that he always delivered. Way overpriced for what we got. Save your $. Go see O or Mama Mia!"
MJ One,"Loved it. Ive seen most of the Cirque shows and this is up there with Love, the Beatles tribute. The story that weaves its way through the show concerns four young people. Its abstract and hard to follow, but in the end, it doesnt matter. The music and lights and movement and dancers take center stage. The highlight is a life sized hologram of Michael Jackson singing and dancing to Man in the Mirror. It was breathtaking ... and heart breaking. Its as close as anyone will ever get to watching this amazing artist on stage again. This show is worth every penny.  I cant wait to go back and show friends this amazing show."
MJ One,"I had never seen a Cirque du Soleil show before, despite having been to Vegas numerous times over many years. The show was fantastic from start to finish, even though my Mom &amp; I sat in the absolutely last row of the theater. Absolutely fantastic."
MJ One,"If youre a fan of Michael Jackson then this is a must-see if youre in Vegas. As with all Cirque du Soleil shows, youre going to pay a pretty penny for the ticket but its definitely worth it. I dont want to give away highlights of the show (as many reviewers have *side eye*) but it provided many high energy moments as well as some that were more subdued in sensuality or reflection. At one point, I actually teared up thinking about how much more of a career may have been ahead for MJ (Im so sensitive). This was one of the best experiences my BF could have provided for me in Vegas and I absolutely recommend it to others."
MJ One,"The best show Ive ever seen in Las Vegas.  An absolute must see!  The show is not a Michael Jackson concert, and not pure Cirque du Soleil.  Its a very sophisticated production combining music, dance, and acrobatics with subtle and not so subtle statements.  One thinks it starts confusingly slow...but no.  Enjoy... Its fantastic!"
MJ One,This show was an awesome experience. Im so glad we went. Who doesnt love Michael Jackson and the music he made. Loved hearing the songs... And the acts were quite good. You almost feel like MJ was there. Ive seen several of the Cirque shows and this is not the same typical Cirque show that you see. It is definitely worth seeing especially if you are a MJ fan. We sat in section 202 midway up towards the center and it was a perfect view. But I dont think you can get bad seats anywhere in the theater. If you are debating what show to go see in Vegas... This is a must!
MJ One,"The show is not too bad. They use quite a bit of high end stage effects to good use. There were some clever moments that made me say cool, but compared to other Vegas Cirque shows, this one is not at the top of my list. A bit annoying were the 4 kids that linked all the segments together. All they seem to do was run around everywhere taking the attention away from the action. If you attend this show, just ignore them.

Can anybody explain the bar stool floating on the curtain before the show why it was upside down? A big thumbs up to the ushers in our section. They were super helpful with a family member in a wheelchair. They even spotted me covering my ears (rock concert volume) and handed me some ear plugs and they kept people from ruining the show with their cell phones."
MJ One,"WOW!!!  The music and dancing was awesome!!!  The lighting and special effects were off the hook!!!  Although the King Of Pop was not here, the essence of MJ was felt throughout the entire show!!!  Joy, laughter and pain...Michael Jackson will live on in our hearts forever and ever!!!"
MJ One,"One of the best shows i,ve seen in vegas.crew was great and on point.very good show writing.this was expected from a cirque show as the other shows are also awesome.the michael jackson songs are all remixed very nicely.show has great light show cordination.and they dont short you on that money spent,its a full 90 minutes of entertainment."
MJ One,"Incredible waste of a LOT of money!  The show had many technical problems, including an extensive breakdown, which caused a long delay.  Dancers were frequently out of sync and lighting was off. The choice of medleys were disjointed and frustrating.  The introduction of a song would be played, but no chorus. The finale was Black &amp; White, which was a strange way to end the show, but looked ridiculous in the interpretation on stage.   Audience reaction to the performance I saw was poor, so I dont think I was in the minority. I had the misfortune of sitting next to guys who consistently chatted and flailed their arms as though they were in the casino. 

Highlights were Billie Jean, which should have been the finale, and a really great pole gymnast.  The theatre and sound quality were beautiful.  I wish the rest of the performance equaled these attributes, but the Michaels brilliance was trivialized or caricatured for much of the show.  

Yes, I did complain about the guys disruptive behavior, and was refunded $10 of my $100+ ticket.  The entire experience was poor.  It was not worthy of Michael Jacksons talent, or the very high ticket price."
MJ One,"Absolutely a delightful experience!!! But anything MJ-related is going to get 5 stars from me by default.  Still, the venue was gorgeous, the shop after the show had great little gifts, the performers stopped to snap a photo with me, and I will treasure this day with me always.  Thanks, Cirque, for capturing the magic and wonder that is Michael Jackson."
MJ One,"Great show. Worth every penny. Any seat in the venue is good, however I would recommend sitting towards the back as there are cool aerialists that you might miss if youre sitting towards the front."
MJ One,"If you are a Michael Jackson fan and know his music, you will probably like this show. I only recognized Billy Jean and Beat It (which I rate so so). Good visuals and great acrobatics and dancing but the music bored me and gave me a headache. If there was a story line, it was incomprehensible to me."
MJ One,"Wonderful show. Great dancers and acrobats, great lighting and good music. There were also videos of some parts of Michaels performances which were so compelling to watch that I was sometimes conflicted as to whether to watch the live show or the video!  I suppose if you dont like Michael Jackson at all this might not be a good fit for you, but I loved it."
MJ One,"WOOOW I have no words to explain all the experience I had yesterday at MICHAEL JACKSON ONE.  I had the opportunity to see all the Cirque du Soleil shows and I have to say that this show is something out of this world. This is a unique and differente Cirque Du Soleil show. This show is full of surprises, there was no boring moment at all, all is energy explosion, very creative sets and incredible adaptations of the music. The show has some very emotive moments that I will not mention to keep the surprise for you, but this is a MUST to SEE show in Vegas. Im so happy that CDS made and incredible well done job with this show.  You will be impress since the beginning to the end of the show. Jamie King made a incredible job in this show, the dancing and choreography are AMAZING! 

Also, this show is totally different from the Arena show MJ Immortal. 

My suggestion about seating: do not get seats close to the stage nor the first rows... try to get in the middle or first seats in the second sections.  The theater is not that big as Aria s theater so you will have a great view!  Also, get your tickets in advance because this show is gonna be sold out like in their times were O &amp; LOVE! 

I saw the show yesterday and Im still thinking of how much I enjoyed the show! Must go and see it! 

PS. the best part for me is the THRILLER! OHH GOD! and MAN IN THE MIRROR...ger ready! 

PS2. Please do not avoid in attending this show if you are not fan of MJ! Even you are not fan, I promise you will be amazed by this production!"
MJ One,"Without a doubt, the best Las Vegas show I have ever been to.  The set design and special effects are unlike anything youve ever seen before.  I want to go back next Vegas trip!"
MJ One,"Lame storyline, Chinese acrobatics, a hodge-podge of spectacles. Truly sideshow-worthy acts and add the music of MJ. Put all of it together in random order and wait for the finale, then youll see what a messy tribute this turned out to be. LOVE at the Mirage was the only other Cirque show Ive seen and that blew this show away. Like pros v. amateurs. For real."
MJ One,"Ive seen about 10 Cirque shows in town and I must say, this was THE BEST show Ive seen so far. Im also not a huge Jackson fan so for me to rate this show a 4 says a lot. There were a lot of thoughts and creativity put into just this one show. The only thing I did not understand was the guitar lady. She was extremely annoying and out of place. Well done Cirque Du Soleil."
MJ One,"I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH ME M . 

He says this show is awesome until they bring out a pole performer . He said it cheapened the show. And that MJ would never agree to having this element. 
This pole dancer is an artist . There wasnt anything in a sexual nature about the pole performance . And for anyone who didnt know MJ personally who wants to speak what they assume he liked and disliked here you go:

 May 24, 2009
Michael Jackson has recruited a professional pole dancer and is set to sign a world baton twirling champion to perform on stage with him during his 50 sell-out UK gigs.Sexy pole star Danielle Rueda-Watts (31) has already landed a plum role among the dozen dancers who will back-up MJ at Londons 02 Arena.

Source: Mike Parker Los Angeles Correspondent for Irish newspaper Sunday World.

He later quotes that Michael has shown interest in signing Japanese gymnast and sixth time Batton Twirling World Champion Noriko Takahashi (30), who is currently appearing in Las Vegas in the Cirque du Soleil production KA at the MGM"
MJ One,"Best show I have ever seen.  I know they just opened and have some kinks to work out, but it was incredible."
MJ One,This is the best Cirque de Soleil show in town. Hands down. Love MJ? U will love this show...
MJ One,"Loved it! We like Mikes music and that definitely contributes to the five star rating. However, I believe even someone who doesnt know all of Mikes songs would find it very enjoyable. Great sound system and great dancing. Its a very enjoyable show.  No intermission so go to the bathroom beforehand!  Nice clean theater too.  We wish our kids were with us on this trip as they would have loved the show.  We will likely go again next year when we return to Vegas."
MJ One,"I have wanted to see this CDS Show since it came out, and finally got to see it on 10/07/2013! I absolutely loved everything about this show, especially that it was more dance based. It still did have the great acrobatics and everything else that CDS is known for. 
One of my most favorite parts of the show had to be the hologram and I loved the dancer that wears the black sparkly outfit. His moves are so fluid and effortless.
I dont think that there is a bad seat in the theater as we had seats in literally the last row, but got moved up closer and I could see everything fine from both locations.
 I think the only thing that I didnt like is that they have paparazzi take your picture and it shows up on the big screen in tabloids. I really didnt enjoy seeing such a bad picture of myself show up there over and over and over again. If I would have known my picture was going to be taken and put up on a screen, then I probably would have been fine with it. 
It is cool that they have MJs crystal socks on display as well a few other pieces of memorabilia."
MJ One,"I found this show entertaining in a different way from other cirque shows Ive seen before. I enjoy michael jackson so I was singing and dancing to the songs and enjoy the entertainment aspect. There wasnt as much acrobatic stuff as other cirque shows, this one is definitely more plot/story oriented and thats okay. It wasnt bad it was just different. My favorite thing is that this company employs a dancer that is uniped (has only one leg) and uses walking crutches to aid him with dancing. This speaks volumes to me for this company. And to those who complain about shows costing all this money and not being blown away, lets see yall get up there and do half the stuff those performers do.... your expectations are way too high. and... lets be honest... all the shows are expensive, thats show business. if you dont want to pay the money then dont go see the shows. its pretty self explanatory."
MJ One,"Very enjoyable! I dont think I can say anything that hasnt already been said, but we really enjoyed this show. Was it the hands-down, best-show-ever-in-the-whole-wide-world? I dont know. Were the tickets really, really expensive? Definitely. Im glad we saw the show and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves MJ."
MJ One,"As a Vegas local I have seen many strip shows, including all the Cirque more than once. This is by far the BEST SHOW in LV Period. Nothing even comes close. I will go as far as saying it was one of my best life experiences. Left us in a state of total awe.  Tip: Dont sit close to the front...the further back the better. Massive stage."
MJ One,"One of the best Cirque shows to date!!! If you are an MJ fan this show will not disappoint. The hologram sequence was breathtaking. Too bad it happens at the back of the stage. There is a couple of forced lame comedy bits, but hey its Cirque Du Soleil. I would pay full price to see this show again. Very family friendly."
MJ One,"Absolutely the most engaging, mind blowing Cirque show to date. Its full sensory overload - color, sound, choreography, images all in sync from above, the sides and in front of you. All set to Michaels music. Youre rocking in your seat and feasting on the experience for the full 90 minutes. Astounding. 

Ive been more than once and each time theres tears, shouts of excitement, and a standing ovation at the end. 

The sound system is out of this world. You hear sounds surrounding you, swirling and engulfing you. The music is happening, and theres other sounds mixed in. Add to it that every seat has its own speaker, too! Theres speakers on the ceiling, the sides and front of the stage, and in the back of the theatre. All programmed impeccably to give you a unique sound experience. 

The dancing is amazing! And yes, theres the lean in Smooth Criminal. Thriller zombies dancing on stage and in the isles. Billie Jean - well, wont ruin that for you! And Dangerous/Dirty Diana (a brilliant bled of the music) was mesmerizing. 

Go. Just go. You wont regret it."
MJ One,"This is one of my favorite shows in Vegas. The music, tricks, and visual effects are just amazing. I did splurge and get a seat in the middle 10 rows from the stage. It was great seats but maybe a little too close. You dont get to see the stuff on the sides as much. However if you go too far back then you dont get to see the main stage acts as well. My recommendation is just go see it multiple times. Its worth it."
MJ One,"We saw La Reve the night before seeing Michael. La Reve was good, but Micheal was awesome!  Definitely worth the money. The seats are comfortable and the show is one of a kind. I would suggest sitting in the lower level but any seat in the house would do."
MJ One,"Best Cirque show I have seen to date and one of the best shows I have ever seen,  period. This show is more focused on the music than the acrobatics, although the stunts were total eye candy. The sound is incredible, with speakers in the seats.  The lighting was a show in and of itself and the effects were mind blowing, especially when MJ is digitally projected on the stage dancing with the crew.  Money well spent."
MJ One,"Not going to post details about the show, but lets just say I didnt want the show to ever end.  It was THAT good. :)"
MJ One,"I admittedly went in with super lofty expectations as each ticket was $170!  Well,  the show exceeded my expectations.  It was absolutely fantastic!  The seats around virtually the whole theater were really good.  The only complaint I would give is that Cirque Du Soleil really needs to enforce people being on time.  They are making so much money, they really should hold the line and say:  If you are late, no entry.  People are rude for being late.  It is up to Cirque to lock them out and let others enjoy uninterrupted"
MJ One,"AWESOME SHOW!! I was at the edge of my seat for the whole performance. My only regret is not getting better seats this is a show that when I do again I will be splurging for sure. I sat second to last row in the center aisle. While I could still see and hear everything fine I would have like to get a closer look at the hologram that is worth the price of admission alone, its the coolest thing I have ever seen. All the dancer were all insync with MJ. Just Amazing!!!"
MJ One,Best show I have ever seen. A must see for Mike Jackson fans.
MJ One,"Truly the best of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas. The show was awe inspiring not only for the acrobatics, but for the dancers, light show and graphics on various screens. And of course, Michael Jacksons music. At one point, Michael Jackson shows up to dance with the rest of the performers via hologram."
MJ One,"Amazing show!! They did such a fabulous job of capturing the essence that was Michael Jackson. If youre going to see any show on the strip, then definitely see Michael Jackson One."
MJ One,"This show was amazing! I need 10 stars! The holograms and special effects are amazing and so  real! The performers are awesome! The theatre is comfortable and fun. It even snows real snow in the show throughout the theatre. This show is a must see! Its magical, touching, fun, exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. Best show I ever saw! Kudos to all the performers for all their hard work!"
MJ One,"This show is AMAZING!!!! The sound is amazing, and the show is very stimulating to you senses! If youre an MJ fan, this is a MUST SEE! Some amazing things happen in this show! From people moonwalking down the walls, a hologram routine with MJ and they even made it snow in the theater! OMG!  I wanted to just stand up and dance several times!!! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS SHOW!  Soooo worth the money!"
MJ One,"If i werent a huge michael jackson fan, i wouldnt were rate the show as high. anything that has MJ sounds is great in my opinion, though show is good, i wouldnt say great. couldnt been better. stage was a bit smaller than i expected. overall on scale of 1-10, id rate it an overall 7"
MJ One,"Incredible! I was reluctant to attend a Cirque show so late thinking it would make me sleepy, HOWEVER...I couldnt stop dancing in my seat! I have maybe 2 of MJs songs on my iPad and was still singing along. This show opened a month and a half ago so no half price/discounted tickets here...so worth every cent! I cant wait to bring other people to see it. Lots of oohs and aahs from the crowd and the performers were very enthusiastic! Buy your ticket already and GO!"
MJ One,"This was my first CDS show and thought it was great.  My favorite part was the Billie Jean and ill be there, Human Nature section.  The trampoline acrobatics was amazing and the Tarzan guy climbing up and down the rope was crazy.  You will understand what i mean when you go see it.  I was kinda bummed You you are not alone wasnt part of the production.  Well, alot of songs were not part of it.  Too many hits to put it all in.  Wish these shows were less money but its Vegas."
MJ One,"Wow!  90 Minute non-stop action with amazing 3D effects, smoke, fireworks, and a small cast that does not stand still for a moment!  Be careful when picking a seat for this show, a lot of action happens overhead of the lower level, dancers running up and down the aisle - including zombies for the thriller number!  If you do sit down there, be warned that during numbers with actors in the air or aisles you will not be allowed to enter the theater - including the opening number so BE PROMPT and sit your ass down!  A number of small children had to leave pretty quickly, so think twice about your little ones - this is loud and explosive!  It is a good show, no doubt and the man in the mirror hologram will blow you away.  I personally still like the Beatles LOVE show better, Ive seen that four times and want to go again every time I am in Vegas but this is one heck of a show!  Enjoy from the upper seats to get the best view of all the action."
MJ One,"The show delivered. Good performances, good music, whats not to like. It was a last minute plan, so we ended up with not too good seats.. There were ushers handing out cushions for the shorter members in our group, kudos to them!"
MJ One,"We have seen Mystere 19 times, O 10 times, KA 4 times, Beatles 3 times, Elvis, Criss Angel, Zarkana, La Nouba 2 times, and many Cirque shows in various cities.  The MJ ONE show was so bad that we still are talking about it a week later.  It STUNK.  Cirque should be ashamed to have their name on it.  We will never go again and will tell as many people as we can to avoid it.

The music was average, including several songs we had not ever heard of.  The 3 skits in a row about saving the world or whatever they are about were awful.  Only 2 of the skits were close to Cirque quality.

Finally, what was with the one legged guy?  I guess it is nice to include him, but he is not even that good.

Terrible show."
MJ One,"If you like Michael Jackson music, it is a must see.  Outstanding sound system.  LOUD!!"
MJ One,This show is worth the trip to Vegas! Especially if you love Micheal Jackson music. The performances were exciting and energetic. The music gave me chills. A hologram of Micheal Jackson makes it seem like he is there. It was my favorite show in Vegas.
MJ One,"I love all things Cirque du Soleil but this is my absolute favorite! I love Michael Jackson and they did a fantastic job in bringing these two worlds together! I was moved to tears-I actually cried watching this show. Its beautiful, fun, emotional- His music combined with the amazing choreography of dancers, gymnasts, everything - just awesome! I dont want to spoil it but you have to see it! This is a definite must see show!"
MJ One,"If you are expecting to see a full on Cirque Du Soleil show, you wont get that at Michael Jackson: One. Granted there was flying, twirling in the air, jumping around, but this was a DANCE show! And rightfully so.. because THAT was MJ! They went through hits like: Bad, Smooth Criminal, Beat It, and my favorites Thriller and Billie Jean. The costumes and choreography for those to songs were awesome! They cut back to MJ in his Jackson 5 days and played Never Can Say Goodbye.. and i couldnt help get emotional. Oh, and the hologram (Man In The Mirror).. I admit, I cried. Not only because it breaks my heart to know the King is gone after the life he lived, but this would be the closest thing to real life that I would ever be in his presence! (Shoot me.. and i wasnt the only one with tears) Lol This show is for TRUE MJ fans. Fans of his music, fans of his moves, and fans of his legacy. Sure, there could have been a lot of other ways that this show could have been better...(EX: the story line of the show.. I was a bit confused- hence minus 1 star).. but again, for what it was, it was great. I highly suggest it to all MJ fans out there.. the only thing youd be somewhat upset about is the fact that you cant get up and JAM out to the music! (The speakers in the seats were cool too ;) ) Definitely go enjoy this show!"
MJ One,"wow! If you like MJ, you will love this show! What a blast. Best show on the strip and we went to a ton."
MJ One,"Have seen all of the Cirque shows.  This one is absolutely amazing.  It hasnt even had its grand opening yet.  It was tight, technically spectacular and not a dull moment to boot.  The attention to detail is mind boggling.  Get there early to experience the paparazzi.  Well done to all involved. Paid for the tickets &amp; will go back several times because there was too much to take in at once.  This one is one of the best live shows in Las Vegas.  Enjoy."
MJ One,"Sorry to say this show was an abysmal disappointment. It doesnt do justice to Michael Jacksons  legacy or to the Cirque du Soleil tradition. The first half is a hot mess, with songs smashing randomly together, a lot of dancing that was far from his standard, and very little of the excitement we associate with Cirque shows. The second half was better, with some great aerial acts and effects, but it wasnt enough to redeem the show. 
I had been looking forward to this for a long time, and could not have been more disappointed. I was there with a group of 12 Jackson fans, and we all left scratching our heads about how his music and Cirque didnt result in magic together. I dont mean to take away from the bright moments-- and there were some-- but we expected way more. We found ourselves watching the video clips more than the performance, which we can do at home for free. 
Spend your money somewhere else."
MJ One,Absolutely a must when in Vegas. We have seen this show  twice and its worth every single penny! The theatre is AWESOME! The show is beyond AMAZING! Definitely should be on everyones bucket list! This show will leave you completely amazed if your a Michael Jackson fan.
MJ One,This show is unbelievable!! Man in the mirror is amazing! Best $ Ive spent in Vegas so far. If you are a fan its a must see.
MJ One,Best show I have seen in my entire life!!!  Hands down!!!  What a tribute to Michael Jackson and the legacy he left. His talent was an absolute gift to the world and continues to be to this day. Words cant describe how unbelievable this show is. Its a must see
MJ One,"Just GO! This show is Awesome.  You will not be disappointed.  This is a well thought of show and I already want to go back and see it again.  The ticket price to some may be steep, but it is well worth the cost. Just an heads up, the acrobatics arent like other Cirque Du Soleil shows. This show focuses more on Michaels music and dancing, as it should."
MJ One,"I am not a giant Cirque Du Soleil fan or even a die hard MJ lover but went to this show
and it was Awesome! I actually want to go see it again next trip.

I was completely entertained and caught myself saying wow a few times during the show. The mix of music, dance, acrobatics, and technology was perfect. I think the crowd applauded like 4 times out loud during the show and left with a standing ovation. 

Seen a lot of Vegas shows...this is a 5 star one."
MJ One,"This was by far the best show i saw in Las Vegas, worth the price. Before the show starts the perfomers go around and mingle and interact with the crowd. Once the lights go out the story and music get turned up. The dancing the acrobatics the music and the setting was flawlesd imo. A breath taking experence. Fans and people just into shows will like it all the same. I suggest setting in the second best spots as you see everything."
MJ One,"I would have never thought a Veags show would be poignant.  But wow, this show gave me a lump in my throat a couple of times and my spouse teared up.  It was a beautiful tribute to MJ.  It really drove home the message that MJ had hoped for a better world full of love.  In the very opening, I was a bit concerned that it was going to be a bust because the dancing wasnt as good as MJ or his troop would do, but I reminded myself that this is Cirque du Soleil not Dancing with the Stars.  After reframing my point of reference I could really appreciate all the energy and details that went into this production. The acts were nothing short of death defying.  I dont know how they do it.  It seemed like each and every cast member loved and was actively paying tribute to MJ. It was beautiful."
MJ One,"Best cirque show ever! Awesome special effects, music and best dancers on the strip! Would love to see this at least 1000x or more."
MJ One,"This show was amazing. The production value was off the charts. The lighting, lasers, and projection mapping was superb. This was less acrobatic then other Cirque shows, but they fill it in with crazy dance routines.  I took my mother whose almost 70 and she was wiggling in her seat the whole time.  You left feeling full of energy and happy. If youre even the slightest Michael Jackson fan you must see this show. If youre a huge Michael Jackson fan this is a no brainer.  Ive seen probably ten different Cirque shows over the years either in Vegas or when they stop in SF on tour, and this is my favorite to date. Highly recommend, you wont be disappointed."
MJ One,"Saw the show with my wife Nov 2013. It was great. I recommend an aisle seat because the performers will be going up and down the aisles. The whole show from start to finish was entertaining and well done. We had some crazy lady behind us that sang every song and in between talked incessantly, we asked her a couple of times to please be quit and she was oblivious. That is not the theaters fault though. Even with that we enjoyed the show which says a lot in itself."
MJ One,"Awful performance if your looking for outstanding Cirque acts.  This was horrible!   I can listen to MJ musice all day long, wanted quality Cirque Acts which this did not provide.   Hate I spent so much money on a terrible performance."
MJ One,"Could be better.  There are many other MJs epic songs were not perform in the show.  Over all, a decent show; definitely could be better.  Since this is still a new show compare to majority of other popular shows in Vegas, there is alot of room to improve."
MJ One,"The Michael Jackson Immortal World Tour show is now one of my favorite Cirque du Soleil shows (next to O). There were various parts of the show that brought tears to my eyes (Where is My Childhood and Gone Too Soon, while others brought laughter (ABC Jackson 5 bit). It was simply enjoyable! I loved the usual acrobatics, but this show became more of an orgasm of light and sound, and dance. I also loved how they kept him as the main singer and the live band/back up singers just backed him up. In addition, they threw in Michaels voice throughout the performance with famous quotes/philosophies he had in his life. It added such a personal touch to the performance, and made it feel like he was still around. The usual Michael Jackson dance moves and routines from his songs were done with a mix of the usual Cirque elements, but certain things were different from other Cirque shows. They added WAY MORE LIGHTS (especially on the acrobats themselves), explosives on stage, as well as those screens where you touch and things move on it.

This show is definitely worth watching! Hope it plans to settle down in Vegas like the rest of them, so I can watch it all over again! Hope the prices go down on those souvenirs though ($50 on a shirt? ahhaha Got it anyways cuz it was nice... :/. Buy the $25 CD though-Its worth it!). 

Dont miss this show!"
MJ One,"This is one of my favorite shows! Amazing sound, music, performances, decorations! I love love love it :))) Must-have to see in Vegas!"
MJ One,"Im not even that big of a Michael Jackson fan and this show blew me away. I think the production leaders, crew, and actors did a wonderful job; this show is a great blend of cirque charm and MJ style. Im not surprised that this show is practically sold out every single performance."
MJ One,"this was an amazing show full of entertainment. there was a MJ hologram which felt very realistic, especially as the dancers were behind him. it was a breathtaking performance mixed with some parts that were cute and some parts inspiring/realistic."
MJ One,"This is the best Cirque show Ive ever seen, hands down.  The marriage of Cirque and MJ is by far the best thing that is happening in Vegas right now.  It brings Michael back to life, in a way.  The acrobatics are amazing, music is timeless, and its as close as you can get to perfection, without having Michael himself."
MJ One,"This should be the last Cirque du soleil show you should see. KA is of course the best. The problem with this show is that nobody actually sings. Yes a few small songs here and there. Mostly they dance to a reworked mix of MJs song. So unlike ABBA the show and even the movie, where various people actually sang complete songs, this show bastardizes all of MJs songs with horrible remixes which are blared through an overly loud, speaker systems.

It leaves you with a profound sense of dissatisfaction. It attempts to create a wow factor with a heavy doses of base which falls flat, creating more noise than effect. And whats with the blonde playing the guitar. Not sure she was even playing the guitar, maybe pretending to strut the stuff and quite badly at that I think. 

The stage setting is also very simple, especially compared to KA. I think they went on the cheap here to save costs. Not really an issue for me since the lighting effects were very good, but the dance choreography which showed flashes of brilliance about 10% of the time was generally far inferior to the other Cirque shows. Yes it will impress folks from the country who are not used to such shows, but those who have experienced high standards, this is not one of them.

This is a $50 show. I was utterly bored and this was and is a disservice to MJ. You are better off seeing This Is It : the movie. That was far more inspiring and enjoyable."
MJ One,"Ok so the Vegas show was amazing, brilliant, over the moon.... I saw it in Sept 2013.... I was so smitten by the show and the hologram which literally brought me to tears that when I found out it was coming to Tampa I immediately bought the best tickets in the theater.... WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! The Vegas show made this circus act look like Walmart. No disrespect to any of the performers they were great but the show lacked in so many ways I cant even begin to describe... I feel cheated :-( the only good thing about this entire ordeal is that my fiancé will be happy to know  that he might be able to lure me back to Vegas one day. Maybe it was the fact that I saw the Vegas show first  that made this one seem so inadequate... If your first time viewer you are you might have a different perspective because you have nothing to compare it to. So disappointed :-("
MJ One,"Cirque du Soleils Michael Jackson One is a satisfying feat that evokes pure, unadulterated joy through the acrobatic troupes performance accented by the state of the art design of the theatre combined with the  sheer genius of the sound design. The show is the rare incredibly ambitious concept which far surpasses what it sends out to accomplish, taking the audience into a collective lucid dream which transcends the mundane and rockets the viewer into another dimension. Imaginative, ambitious, ethereal, emotive and simply stunning, this show is among the most enjoyable experiences one will have the gift of having, whether in the Oasis of lights which is Las Vegas, or anywhere else."
MJ One,"easy access, lots of staff to accommodate your needs, if you look the slight bit lost someone immediately appears and shows you the way. very interactive and fun, very loud so be prepared if you are sensitive. Seats were great!"
MJ One,"I am not sure why this is a Cirque show. Not much Cirque, but a wonderful show, with great dancing and acrobatics. I cried a few times, missing this great talent, too soon gone. We ended up in the front row, which had some disadvantages. I am not sure how hat happened, as we bought the tickets months ago. Maybe it has to do,with when they are picked up. Being up close was at the same time kind of neat, as we could really see the work the dancers put into their craft. Being that we also saw O,  while in Vegas, I am thinking that the Vegas shows are maybe not as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows we have seen over the years."
MJ One,I expected to see more acrobatics like the rest of the shows.  Although there were some great scenes it doesnt match up to the other cirque productions here in Vegas.  I grew up listening to MJ and watching his videos.  Who is the blond lady that plays such a huge part and if she is so significant why didnt she play such a huge part in his videos like the show??  Great talent as always but the choreography was disappointing.
MJ One,"A group of four us attended the Saturday Night 9:30 Show, May 31. Two of us are big fans of Michael Jackson, two us just familiar with a few songs. The show started with very loud music tracks and garishly bright lighting effects. 

The dancing was good, but not much better than good. The Cirque du Soleil portions of the show were uneven at best and only occasionally rose to the level of excellence that Cirque has become known for.

It was as if the performers were simply going through the motions and trading on their name Cirque du Soleil.

We were seated about midway up in the center section and had to pay more than $175 each for tickets and all of us left the show very disappointed.

My recommendation is skip this show and save a good chunk of change,"
MJ One,"This was really good, I just dont know how I feel about continuing to exploit someone even after they have passed."
MJ One,"I really enjoyed the show, but the part that escaped me was the storyline behind the four main characters in the show.  It lacked something substantive to make it transformative and worth the price of admission (~$175 per person).  Maybe I had high expectations for what could be done with MJs full life history and body of work.  I can say if you genuinely love Michaels music and you add in the amazing tumbling, trampolines, and wire work it is worth seeing MJ One.  I look forward to comparing it to other Cirque shows on our next return to Las Vegas."
MJ One,"I felt Michael!! The guy behind sang along to most songs and the couple in front of me was having out of body experiences. If you love Michael, this is deep. So many high points! Love Cirque!!"
MJ One,"This show is fun and exciting! There is somewhat a story line for those that want a Cirqque du Soleil show with a story line. The visual effects were great, music great (some popular hits and some that just went with the flow of the show), and i would recommend not sitting in the first few rows, your view might be obstructed for some stunts."
MJ One,"I was really disappointed with this show. For starters, I have seen many of the Cirque shows- Mystere, O, Zumanity, Zarkana, Ovo, and La Nouba. I absolutely love the cirque shows, but not ONE. For starters, we sat in the second row. This was a mistake for two reasons: 1) its actually better to sit further back for Cirque shows especially when there is any sort of flying around in the air being done. You have to look straight up or backwards at times. 2)the show had fog during several routines. Well these fog machines were literally right in front of us. It smells bad and I was choking on it throughout the show. Not fun.  The bad seats werent the only reason I was disappointed. I expect amazing acrobatics to be done during these shows, but ONE didnt have much of this. I felt it was more choreographed dancing to Michael Jackson songs. Sure, the costumes and dancing was good,  but not what I expect from a Cirque show. There were moments I was yawning and would catch myself day dreaming. I feel they could have done a better job with this show, and I would recommend skipping it and seeing a different Cirque show that Vegas has to offer.  It was too much dancing around and not enough tricks/acrobatics."
MJ One,"AMAZING!!  I knew this show was going to be great, but it far surpassed my expectations. Definitely a must see. The song selection was perfect and performers were top notch.  Worth every penney.  I would see it again in a minute!!"
MJ One,"I was so excited to see this Cirque du Soleil but was so disappointed. I was expecting to be amazed and blown away by the performance but sadly that was not the case. It had too much going on, you didnt know to look at the stage, the ceiling, or the walls. I kept in mind that it was a Cirque du Soleil and there were going to be acrobats routines but there was a part in the show which they were just jumping the whole entire song!!. I also didnt understand what was the point of the plot. They couldve done way better. If it wasnt because I paid all that money I wouldve walked out. If youre ever in Vegas go somewhere else and see another Cirque de Soleil, dont waste your night seeing this show."
MJ One,"I have enjoyed every Cirque show Ive seen...until last night.  I am dumbfounded at how utterly dull and contrived this show is.  The few acrobatic acts in the show are uninspired and are comprised of skills that a compulsory level gymnast can do.  There are a few acts worthy of applause, notably a shadow performance and two where dancers are illuminated in lights, but the others were dance numbers which reflected no originality.  The song selection is what you might expect although a few were obscure at best and other great songs suspiciously absent.  Whats worse is Dont Stop Til You Get Enough is relegated to a sloppy encore and Ill Be There was sadly abbreviated.  Most unbareable was the forced message created by the juxtaposition of songs and Jackson quotes.  The show seems intent on making MJ a martyred spirit to the four bland characters who have no talent without his penny loafers, glove, sunglasses and hat.  Throw in endless cliched allusions to videos including a badly painted rocket ala Black or White and projected images of Diana Ross and Liz Taylor and you have Michael Jackson One.  All that was missing was a demonized portrayal of Conrad Murray and an act featuring Bubbles.  The only reason I didnt leave at intermission is because there was no intermission.  As I left, all I could muster was to  mutter the word horrible over and over until I could find my way to the bathroom.  Save yourself the agony and the $300 and watch a few videos on YouTube."
MJ One,Awesome show. This is a must watch while in Las Vegas. The show gives a great tribute to Michael Jackson.
MJ One,What an excellent show!!! I enjoyed the dancing and music. Its a great production!
MJ One,"Went last night not expecting too much. Well, the show was AMAZING!!!  I loved every performance! I will go again!"
MJ One,"It was good. Obviously MJ songs are incredible and they did a great job of showcasing the best ones.  The cirque muses were a little too much for this show for me.   I enjoy them in the other cirque shows, but this show was a little more on the serious side and I feel like they took away from the show instead of adding to it.  Not much acrobatics, so if you are looking for a true circus show, you will be disappointed. Some of the dancing left me unimpressed. It started off slow, but for better.  There is not a bad seat in the theater, so dont pay $200 a ticket  like we did, any seat will be fine.  Also, The Beetles tickets start out at $50, so if you havent seen a lot (or any ) Vegas Shows, go with a different one.  We saw ONE, because we have seen everything else the strip has to offer. It was good, but for the ticket price I expected AMAZING.  And I love MJ. I grew up in the 80s listening to it all."
MJ One,One of the better cirque shows. They did most of his big songs. Two things we didnt care for was the volume. This was a very loud show and they seemed to repeat some acts. Overall it was good. One of the better shows. Too bad Elvis cirque isnt around; that one blew ALL other cirque shows away. A cool thing was a hologram used in man in the mirror. It was as if Michael was on stage. The light up suits were also very cool. This is worth seeing.
MJ One,Excellent show! Wonderfully imaginative &amp; creative; precise execution of acrobatics &amp; dancing; excellent music (of course! Its MJs music!). Be sure to get there 15 minutes before the 90-minute show starts; youll get a little pre-show entertainment. Very close to being child friendly  except that one song uses the F word &amp; theres an excellent pole dancing episode. WELL WORTH SEEING!
MJ One,Worst Cirque du Soleil show ever. It was ok as a tribute show but as a cirque show it was awful.
MJ One,"This show is a waste of your hard earned money. The dancers as a whole were awful, just going through the moves. Michael Jackson would have turned over in his grave if he had witnessed this production.The show room is small, the seating,its like packing sardines in a can and the show room is dirty."
MJ One,"i have nothing but good things to say about this amazing show! i am a forever michael jackson fan since I was pretty much a toddler and i feel Michael Jackson ONE was able to capture true MJ essence in such a rhythmic, captivating, lively, and creative way. all portions of the show were full of talented performers/dancers!! never a dull moment for sure! i can even admit that i teared up when Man in the Mirror came on with a full hologram of michael performing the entire song. it looked so real as if he was really on stage with his background dancers. many of the dancers pulled off his signature moves with such ease and all looked so natural being there honoring one of the greats of music history. i HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this show to everyone. i would go back in a heartbeat! i wanted to see it again the minute it ended... it was SOOO good. everyone seated around me highfived each other because the whole experience was just so amazing and you could tell it brought everyone together. i would say it is not like most Cirque du Soleil shows where there are a lot of acrobats because there is definitely more dancing at this show. some may find that a flaw, but i honestly felt like it was such a plus. Ive seen other cirque shows and will say ONE is gonna be a tough one to compete against. gift shop is full of great souvenirs including dvds of michaels concerts and collections of his mini-movie music videos. also the lobby encases many of MJs belongings like his shoes, jackets, records, signed lyrics, etc. really really really cool too. i couldnt get myself to leave the area because i felt so surrounded by the love of michael jackson amongst so many fans who were just as starstruck as i was that night. truly worth coming to see if michael jacksons music still moves you at your core to this day."
MJ One,If you remember and liked the 80s and are a big MJ fan it is like Cirque Du Soleil created a show based on your childhood.  Well put together and very respectful of the original music.  they put their spin on it but the songs werent bastardized.   Ive been twice and look forward to going again!!!
MJ One,"I think my husband and I were the only two in the theater who were bored.  Everyone else seemed to like it.  We expected more acrobatics and tricks.  This was pretty much straight dancing.  The dancers were great, though."
MJ One,"Excellent show, very cool effect with MJ dancing through Man in the Mirror. Recommend you check this out, but try to save some on ticket price if possible. The latest and greatest is also the most expensive."
MJ One,Unbelievable. The Billie Jean with light up costumes and Thriller were fantastic and my favorite.
MJ One,Fantastic show featuring MJs music and choreography inspired by his stage and video performances. The show includes the dramatic acrobatics expected of a CDS performance but the cast also dances and even a few sing along. Ive been to several other CDS performances and this one tops them all. Its a 90-minute acrobatic music video!
MJ One,"Not much better than the Immortal World Tour. Had free tix and still felt like I had been ripped off. Best way to enjoy MJ is to stay home, cue up the songs, and challenge your friends to a dance-off! My girlfriend enjoyed ONE but I was not impressed at all."
MJ One,"I thought the Bellagio O show was the best thing in Vegas before I saw this show.  Granted Im a huge MJ fan, this show was the best thing I ever saw.  Before you enter the theater, there are fake paparazzi taking pictures of you to give you the feeling of being a celebrity.  The show was great and the dancers were unbelievable.  Everybody was on their feet and dancing near the end.  Highly recommended."
MJ One,"Michael Jackson was great, One was OK. I had a multi-generational group, Im in my 50s, my mom and my 20 something kids. Though I grew up w Jackson 5, my mom and I were disappointed that we didnt recognize a third of the songs. We were sitting in the 2nd to the last and the 3rd to the last row. We were a parry of 8 and I spending so much money was a concern. Our seats were ok but spending a little bit more for give rows closer would may have been. worthwhile. But if I paid more than $150 per seat, I would have regretted it. My brother fell asleep and even the Thriller number couldnt keep him awake, and for my mom, Jersey Boys was better than MJ and less than half the price. Best seats are probably in the middle. Like most Cirques, too close to the stage isnt good. This cirque show is tough because MJ was such a great performer. When you hear MJ singing, you want to see his actual music video, the Cirque cast are not as good as MJ himself. During the Thriller number, I turned to my brother and he was sleeping. I also didnt enjoy the political message numbers.  My favorite Cirque show is Love. Ive seen it three times and I would see it again. Love is also better for a multigenerational group."
MJ One,So so so good!! I literally smiled the whole time. Perfect mix of cirque acrobatics and great dancing! Lovely tribute to MJ!
MJ One,"This show was absolutely amazing!!! I nearly cried twice! It reminded me of how much I miss Michael as a entertainer. We were lucky enough to moved from the very last row to the lower level (I think because the show didnt sell out, it being a late Sunday night) but ether way I would say it was worth every penny. I also love that had a little of everything for everyone... acrobats, singing, dancing, even a few magic tricks. I highly  recommend seeing this show."
MJ One,0 stars! Show turned off 5 min in! Worst Vegas show experience ever! So disappointed. May never book another Vegas show again. Thanks for nothing Mandalay Bay
MJ One,THIS is the type of show you want to see when you go to Las Vegas!!  Anyone who grew up in the 70s - 90s and knows MJs music will absolutely LOVE this performance.  I was literally dancing and singing along in my seat.  My entire group had a wonderful time and could not stop talking about what an incredible performance it was.  I still have Michael Jackson songs in my head day later and I would go back to see this show again.
MJ One,"Are you kidding me people??? Kenny Ortega where r you??? This show needs serious help! The story line is weak. I thought I was watching an episode of Scooby Doo! Four characters sneaking around with flashlights peering around to see I dont know what??? Weak! Weak! Weak! Seriously, can the creep factor get any higher? The coffin with the skeleton, the trunk with an animatronic gloved hand, and oh dont forget the 10 second dancing shoe number. We now know that Michael has been dismembered.
Ugh!! The choreography was rag tag and so were the dancers. Why was the gold guitar chick in every number standing in the back ground looking socially awkward? The clips of Michael Jackson performing made the cast look like amateurs.We loved the Michael Jackson hologram, but seriously, he looked about 5 feet tall. Come on!
Even the theater looked run down and dirty. This was no tribute to the King of Pop!
I left the show feeling incredibly sad because I realized that we will never be a talent like MJ again."
MJ One,Phenomenal! This show truly captures the spirit and energy of Michael. It takes you on a ride that you never want to end! I was lucky enough to be at the World Premier and I just could not help but be swept up in the excitement &amp; energy of the audience. I will see this again and again and recommend it to everyone!
MJ One,"Horrible!  Singer was off key. Only one person throughout the entire production could moonwalk. Guitarist should not be out for every number which was distracting. Gymnasts are not dancers. Please hire dancers for this kind of show. Thriller was so boring and pathetic. I was expecting the bigger hits to have some dance element, but the show was boring and dry. This was jusy pathetic. Holograms of MJ dancing himself got the biggest round of applause.  Sad"
MJ One,"Absolutely outstanding!  Weve seen almost every Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas except Zarkana (its so new) and Criss Angels Believe (based on poor reviews). Michael Jackson ONE has all the elements wrapped up into one amazing package. With speakers in each seat, the music sounds and feels like you are at an MJ concert (and Ive been to a few of those myself). The dancing is spectacular -- with all the signature MJ moves and then some new ones added. The acrobatics are on par with all the other Cirque shows weve seen. I dont want to detail too much and spoil the fun and surprises for other people.  Suffice to say that my first words to my husband after the show were . . . Id like to hide in the bathroom until the next show and grab any empty seat to see it again!  MJ was the consummate performer . . . this tribute and legacy show stays true to MJ and provides the stupendous Cirque experience all wrapped into ONE!"
MJ One,"We were there Saturday night  (Aug 31) and this by far is the best show ever. Not only is it musically perfect, but emotional, inspirational, and motivational. I actually cried at one point where it showed Michael singing Ill be there. It was non-stop music and dancing. Our seats were further up, but it was perfect, because we were able to view the whole stage, and see the acrobats coming and going from the stage up top. The hologram was amazing and looked so real. I honestly could not keep still, I was either rocking back and forth in my seat, moving my feet, or nodding my head to the music. My 6 year old daughter loves Michael and she loved it. Entertaining from beginning to end. I cant say enough good things about it. Go see it if you havent."
MJ One,"This should have been titled Michael Jackson in Purgatory. It was dark, sinister and depressing. The masks are evil looking, It is overdone with the same computer beat throughout most of the show. It needed a narrator to tell you what was going on. The political agenda was tiresome. It livened up a little at the end, so I gave it two stars instead of one."
MJ One,Missing the cirque. This show could have been great . The cirque is just not there and they should have left that out of the title. If that was not in the title I would have given more stars.
MJ One,I am a big Micheal Jackson fan but the show was not all that good it was ok but it was definitely not worth the price my friend paid for. Paid $265 for 2  to sit in the back and we had discounted prices. Throughout the show at some parts there was just too much going on at once on the stage.The show consist mostly of people jumping around doing aerobics to MJ music. Just a whole lot of confusion save your money youll be better off just buying all MJ classic albums.
MJ One,"I wanted to LOVE this show, but I didnt.  I love Michael Jacksons music and dancing, but this is not the show for that--how sad is it when the best dance segments are videos of Michael? The whole first half of the show is unimpressive (what the heck is a ninja girl doing in this?) and the pantomime of the person chasing MJs glove is underwhelming.  What can I say...it is French--and they worship Jerry Lewis... The second half picks up and the ending is OK, but get rid of the political statements and Martin Luther King.  Come on--we were there to be entertained NOT proselytized! Billie Jean is good--the 3 black chicks have more sass than the whole rest of the cast combined, too bad they are not featured. Any seat in the room is good, just some better than others, so save your money.  Go see Beatles LOVE for a show that is done right!"
MJ One,"I am not a fan of cirque shows or MJ, but this show really blew me away.  It was exciting, entertaining, amazing, I could go on and on about this show.  Grab a ticket, it is worth every dollar.  This is the only show that I have seen on the Vegas strip where I was truly moved.  I can now say this is the BEST show on the Las Vegas strip."
MJ One,"Greatly disappointed that this was not a typical Cirque Du Soleil show.  Lots of flashing lights and loud music but few of the elegant acrobatics that are so pleasing in O, KA, LOVE, MYSTERE -- all shows I have loved.  The dancers are very talented but that did not offset the harshness of the production.   I would not recommend this Cirque to friends and family as I have the others.  LeReve at the Wynn would be a great substitute for an evenings entertainment."
MJ One,"Amazing!! I grew up listening to MJ and this was just beyond expectations, I loved it! I dont think my goosebumps went away the entire show. This definitely isnt as acrobatic as other Cirque shows, there is more dancing, but I think that is what a person would expect from one based on Michael Jackson. That being said, the dancing, the acrobatics, everything was just great. I smiled ear to ear, danced in my seat, cried, laughed, I cant say enough about this show. The talent that all Cirque performers have is incredible!"
MJ One,"This by far is the best total entertainment show on the strip. It had everything youd want from beginning to end. Its not your typical daredevil style Cirque show; however it was energetic and had its share of fabulous acrobatics, but the reason to see this show is Michael Jackson the entertainer. The true King of Pop! Fan or no fan, this was a fabulous showcase of MJ showmanship and genius. The music was simply outstanding, the performances are world class. Best seats are in the back as there is so much to take in. I highly recommend this show and Ive seen must on the strip. do yourself a favor, GO SEE IT!!!!!"
MJ One,this show is not even close to the o show and the same price!! yes we all love mjs music! that is as far as it goes! lots of dancing and a little acrobatics. not worth the price!! i have seen almost all the cirque shows and this one is just not up to par. sorry!!
MJ One,"If I could give it a 0 stars I would.  What a disappointment . Definitely not worth the money for 2 people. I love Michael Jackson and his music . Definitely my inspiration when it came to buying tickets, however this show did not live up to its Yelp reviews . The views of our seats were ok. Security was annoying everytime I had to check my phone he was flashing his bright LED flashlight in my eyes.  Now the show was ok, Im a fan of MJ and the music is what saves this show.  Way too much just dancing and not enough production behind it.  If you were to compare the o show to this its like a high school production to broadway.  There were short creative scenes but the people at Cirque definately skimpped on the stagging and being more creative.  With all the access vegas has for its shows and cirque being able to put awesome shows I expected more. Hopefully Cirque isnt loosing its touch, hiding behind its name and getting too big for its own good.  Not worth the close to $400 we paid for not even center lower seats"
MJ One,"I want to start this review by stating that I am not a Michael Jackson fan.  I bought two tickets for my husband as a Valentines gift since he really wanted to see this show.  The theatre itself is very beautiful and is MJ to a t- all gold and diamonds everywhere!  I started to realize when I walked in and saw how fancy it was and all the MJ relics that no wonder tickets were so expensive- they truly spared to expense to honor the King of Pop.  The show was equally as lavish with graphics, dancers, performers, a 3-D hologram of MJ, fireworks, snow, mist, and fire.  The things I was most impressed by were the second part of the Thriller act, the Billie Jean glow-in-the-dark dance, the one-legged dancer on crutches (um HELLO how is this person not the star and more famous!!!) and the 3-D hologram.  I dont want to say anything else to ruin the show for you.  If I really wanted to reach for a dislike about this show it would be how extremely loud it was.  I really wished I had brought earplugs with me.  I can understand that they want the show to be loud enough for everyone to hear and to drown out any chatter but this was ridiculously and needlessly deafeningly loud.  Im actually shocked their are no laws against how loud shows can be because it was that crazy.  This definitely was one of the more expensive shows- I paid $250 for two tickets in the middle of the back and near an aisle and had a 30% discount, but it was well worth it.  Even if you are not an MJ fan you will enjoy this tribute and realize why so many fans and people appreciated him."
Mystere,"This has to be the most incredible show I have ever seen. Words can not suffice to say how amazing this experience was !!!!!
I purchased 2nd row seats, however there was not a bad seat in the house. I enjoy being close to the performers, this totally blew my mind. Every performer was shockingly fantastic.
So recommended. This is a must see."
Mystere,"The show was awesome. Kept all the audience on the edge of the seat. Even in between performances, there would be comedy going on and other small acts would keep the audience captured. I felt like some acts were not that well coordinated and also since its going on at the stage, in the air above audience and in so many directions I could not figure out whats the best seating to view everything. We were seated in the centre front and the acts were also happening behind us so it was not that convenient to see. But I really enjoyed the show. 

One tip sit, at the back not at the front."
Mystere,"Always amazed by Cirque du Soleil! After almost 40 years, the original never fails! Not a bad seat in the house. I captured these awesome pics on the iPhone 11 Pro Max!"
Mystere,"I have seen most, if not all, the Las Vegas Cirque shows. My last review was for RUN, which was horrible but this is different. This is what a Cirque show is suppose to be. Excellent in all ways. The performers were great and especially the gymnastics and tumbling. The show is funny and exciting. It may very well be my favorite Cirque show."
Mystere,"Good entertainment. Some of the outfits are a little risqué- I understand it is Vegas but they also tout being family friendly. Men is speedos prancing around - no bueno. Loved the acrobats, pole climbers, high wire acts...etc. TrueType talented folks. The baby is a bit of an oddity to mix with the show - doesnt fit so much. The clown like guy is so- so. Lots of special effects - does get very loud - people next to us got up and out and in - 5 times - so distracting. 
Would see again."
Mystere,What an amazing show. We sat front row and were blown away by the amazing talents of the performers. Truly a must see show in Las Vegas.
Mystere,"Ive never been disappointed by any Cirque du Soleil shows, as theyre my favorite shows to attend when available! I wouldve written a review from the others Ive seen in the past, however since I am now a part of the Yelp trend Im only reviewing events/places Ive stepped foot in/on since a part of Yelp.

This show is a hands down 5 star. I was in Vegas for a few days for New Years Eve until the New Year and wanted to attend a show with my girlfriend, scored two tickets at the Tix4Tonight for $83 a piece ($166 fees/taxes included).

Like any Cirque du Soleil, the show is full of acrobatics and athleticism, which set the show aside from any other show out there. The acting is great and the comedy included with props does not have one dull moment in it. Id say the show was about an hour and a half in total with not a bad view in the house. Check it out if youre in the area!"
Mystere,"This is the original permanent cirque Vegas show. This Show is both cute and creepy. Especially the big fat baby. Nevertheless, it is both interesting and amazing. Even the weirdness of it draws you in. The talent and acrobatics are other worldly.  This accomplishes what every Vegas show should: a total separation from reality and thoroughly entertaining. It makes fantasy come to life. I recommend this for people visiting Vegas who have never seen a Cirque du Soleil show or who are cirque fans so that they can check this mesmerizing show off their list."
Mystere,"Great Show
Dont be late to your seat or you may be part of the show
Wonderful mix of humor and stunning feats of athleticism 
Had front row seats
Audience is part of the show
Very funny- laugh out loud parts
Highly recommended"
Mystere,"Now this is a show. 
Jaw-dropping aerobatics, stunning acrobatics, detailed costumes, huge and elaborate stage props, hauntingly beautiful music...the list goes on.  
Funny, awe-inspiring and just a dazzling show!
We had 3rd row seats and the performers maintained eye contact with you giving me the odd feeling of being inside their show. 
Entertainment at its finest.
Bravo!"
Mystere,"I watched Mystere over ten ago - my first Cirque show - and thought it was super weird and didnt like it. The big baby? Creeeeepy. 

At the time - my 21 year old self didnt realize it wasnt a play I guess. 

Years later, After I saw other Cirque shows I loved, I decided I wanted to see it again.

So, I watched it again two years ago.. Some things they changed, but some stayed the same from all those years ago.  The main change was me - I really, really enjoyed it. So much so, I went again with different people a year later. 

The acrobatics are fantastic. Id recommend it as a first time show for the price and to get a feel for the Cirque shows."
Mystere,This was my first ever cirque show and I saw it several years ago. I really want to see it again and if you havent seen the shows in Vegas yet this is a good intro show to start with to get the feel of the talent in Vegas.
Mystere,Is a mix of acts you see on America Got Talent. Just ok. Lame clown. Money grab on vegas.com excessive fees. Very expensive.
Mystere,"All I can say is WOW! I was mesmerized with the way the performance was done. Those performers can do amazing moves with their bodies. The human body is truly a work of art. Being in Vegas we were able to bring our own booze which was great. We bought snacks at the entrance. 

Seats were at a discount since the stay was at Treasure Island and were reasonable. My bf and I really enjoyed it and cant wait to go again."
Mystere,"I love this show, this amazing atmosphere.  I feel like a kid again.  Someday Ill be back there again."
Mystere,"Fraud. They sold me a gift card and refused to honor it or provide a refund after two separate hour-long phone calls.  Save your patience, time, and money and see a different performance in Vegas 
Most importantly, do not buy tickets directly through their webpage and especially do not buy gift cards - they pick and choose when they will honor them, despite no exclusions being listed in the fine print."
Mystere,Wonderful experience for my first Cirque show. Was impressed with the overall entertainment For people of all ages. Kid friendly but a few risqué moments that will fly right over young kids understanding. The show comes at you in waves with incredible activation while having some playful interactions during pre show and brief breaks from the remarkable feats of balance and strength. Will be seeing many more of these shoes in the future.
Mystere,"This show was fantastic- even better than KA at the MGM! The aerial tricks left me gasping in surprise, and the gymnastics were incredible!
This show is also hilarious, there were so many parts that had us doubled over with laughter!

If you have time to see one show in Vegas, make it this one- just avoid the Awful timeshare presentations and the buffet."
Mystere,"WHAT A SHOW!  Im pretty sure most people have heard of Cique du Soleil by now but maybe have yet to experience any of their shows. I happend to be that person until now. I was fortunate enough to attend Mystere with my family while staying in Vegas. This show was a real spectacle and great pleasure for the senses! I was in Ahhh throughout the performance!

Is it a circus? Yes! Is it anything like youve ever seen in other circus? Heck No! Theyre costumes and makeup were amazing! It was an absolute feast for the eyes! 

No animals were used during the performance and they werent even missed! Even the small skits used during the quick changes were very funny and entertaining.  Some of those short skits involved a man baby with a giant red bouncing ball. At first I thought,  ok, this is weird but he quickly grows on you and becomes very funny! 

Cirque Du Soleil Mystere is a must see. Dont think about it, Just do it!  You wont regret it."
Mystere,"Such a great show!
Jaw-dropping aerobatics, stunning acrobatics, detailed costumes, huge and elaborate stage props, hauntingly beautiful music...the list goes can go on. I was mesmerized with the way the performance was done. Those performers can do amazing moves with their bodies. I cant wait to go back and see thier other shows!"
Mystere,"Cirque du soleil shows are amazing. I went to go watch this on the weekend with my family. It is a 90 minute show without an intermission. 

 The show is interesting to be honest. At first, I was debating whether I should be watching this or other shows in Las Vegas, but I was curious to see what one of the first shows that Cirque du soleil produced was all about. 

 I dont like to spoil anything, but I would have to say that the show was worth the purchase. It is located in Treasure island hotel. It is surrounded by many other smaller shops and the casino. ( Standard for most of the shows). There are no bathrooms inside, you would have to go to one next to the casino. 

 Let me tell you more about the inside. It is moderate to large in size of a theatre. There is a pre-show where a comedian goes around and messes around with guests. He is also one of the hosts along with a puppeteer and a giant baby. These hosts usually perform when the acrobatic performers are getting a drink or dressing up for the next act. 

 The music and visuals are great and if you are into fast paced shows, this one sticks exactly on schedule. The one thing that kind of bothered me was that the seats are too close for comfort. The seats were also a little bit uncomfortable. (Similar to the comfort of movie theater seats). 

 The prices say on the billboards that they are $49.50 and upwards. But, we ended up paying $70 each with a discount card. The person at the ticket booth said that during the weekend, the prices increase. The shows also only show twice and at night. I happened to see this show at 9:30 pm although you can see it at around 7:00pm. On a side note, you may purchase tickets to sit close to the stage. These priced seats are more than $100. I cant tell you the exact price but it is close to $100. You can also get picked on by the hosts if you decide to sit closer. 

 The dress code is casual and children may watch it. The show is mainly a mixture of humor, acrobatics and beautiful music. The visuals and creativity of the show is mind-blowing. Whoever created cirque du soleil is genius."
Mystere,"Such an amazing display of strength and flexibility. Very abstract in the storyline but interesting to follow with costume elements that help the evolution timeline progress. Mystere is a perfect name for this show. As other Cirque venues, there is no bad seat. Enjoy!!"
Mystere,Amazing! You dont want it to be over. Incredibly impressive acrobatics and keeps you engaged the whole time. I found the bits with the giant baby to be very tiresome and completely detract from the show. But the performers are so talented I still have 5 stars
Mystere,"This is hands down one of the best shows in Vegas!! I was saying wow the whole time. 

Theyre super talented, funny, and they put a hell of a show! Everything was perfect from the performances to the music and sound effects to the customes and decorations and visual effects and colors.

If youre in Vegas and looking for a show, THIS IS IT. Do not think twice, go buy your ticket!"
Mystere,Although Ive only been to two CdS.... I loved this one compared to Ka.  Its more light hearted and easy to follow. The acrobatics are amazing and I dont believe theres a bad seat in the house.  We loved the fact that if you wanted you could bring the kiddos and theyd actually enjoy it.  The popcorn and soda atmosphere make it easy to dress down but you could also dress up if you wanted. This is the original for the city and its been there a long time.  Theres a reason for that.  A good first option for CdC.
Mystere,"We are not gamblers, but had a day and a half in Las Vegas and 4 days in ST. George Utah, for a little mini vacation. I have always wanted to see Cirque du Soleil. I asked the ticket agent about the various shows and she told me there were six different shows but all excellent in her opinion. I told her that we had a 6 year old with us and asked which one she would recommend for our gard-daughter to see? She gave us two options, then I asked her to narrow it from there and she suggested Mystere.

The production was spectacular with a perfect blend of comedy as well as extreme talent, that has you sitting back mesmerized.

Trust me, even if you dont have a child with you, this show is top notch and a must see.

Thank you for a phenomenal performance!"
Mystere,"Wow, wow and wow!! There are 2 or 3 Cirque shows I havent seen and every show thus far has just been WOW! O is probably my favorite because of the water and my lack of water talents makes me appreciate it that much more. This show was beautiful and wonderful and yeah.....just go and enjoy yourself!"
Mystere,"Mystere is my least favorite Cirque show, but that does not discount the AMAZING work everybody in the show does every day they perform! Amazing acrobatics and amazingly talented folks work on this show. You will have to check this out for yourself for a true review. I just personally think all the other Cirque shows should be on the top of your list whereas this can be seen when it does.

I personally didnt like this as much as some of the other Cirque shows, simply put. I think part of it was the big baby act -- just wasnt a fan. I dont believe there was a linear storyline, which was something I really enjoyed in KA. I guess my issue was watching KA first and Mystere second, thinking itd be similar to that, so my expectations were not managed well.

Again, not my personal favorite but still great production and set."
Mystere,"Ive had the privilege to attend quite a few Cirque du Soleil performances. In Vegas, they are a permanent fixture and the biggest hotels get to host their very own show. Such is the case with Mystere. 

We came for a food and wine affair, but we had to see a show! We chose Mystere simply because it was the show the hotel we stayed in -Treasure Island- hosts. There is not right or wrong choice when it comes to there shows. They are all amazing in their own right.

This one blew mw away. I never know what the actual story is all about, but the magnificence of the performances take my breath away every time.  
There is always an element of humor as well, and I thought this one -a fat baby getting into mischief- was the funniest and cutest I have seen. 
There was also two uber muscular guys preforming a jaw dropping show of strength. This part of the performance may make some people feel uncomfortable due to the various positions they get in that may look a little suggestive. I just thought it was incredible. Phenomenal show!!"
Mystere,Amazing! Dont be late! I was truly impressed and entertained the entire time. The BIG baby was my favorite part ! This was my first Cirque du Soleil and I will be back!!!
Mystere,"Dazzling from start to finish. The acrobatic choreography is as beautiful as it is impressive. This show had us thrilled with amazement! Comedy bits, musicians, and dancers all fantastic too."
Mystere,4-17-19 we went to this show for our anniversary.  Omg it was so great!! My son is 10 and was laughing or smiling the whole time.  What a great family friendly show.  I dont want it to end. You didnt know which way to look something going on in all directions.  Its nice to find a family show to go and enjoy.  Cant wait to go to the next one.
Mystere,"Great show, affordable (minus the food, $5 bottles of water), interactive, and kid friendly. Like a few other reviewers pointed out, while were all human, a lot of mistakes during the shower. I am sure they were understandable upset, but for the price of admission, seeing people fall down seems silly.

Will see another cirque du soleil in the future"
Mystere,"This is only my second Cirque show (LOVE was the first) so I dont have the frame of reference a lot of other reviewers do. That said, it was an entertaining show for sure - its incredible watching what people can do with such ease!  Even from fairly far back, we had a great view. There are a few weird parts, but overall its an enjoyable show and you can see it for fairly cheap, especially last minute."
Mystere,"Im giving this show 2 stars because its a repeat of one of their last shows.  The big gown old baby needs to go its not funny and does not flow with the show. The old Albert Einstein looking guy is a liability, throwing food and what appeared to be champagne when it hit me in my face and got into my eye and landed me in the E.R. The manager did not care he said it was water, water doesnt burn when it get into your eyes.
Now if you attend this show bring your umbrella the Einstein guy is rude and flips people the bird.
If youve seen cirque before make sure you know whos in them so you dont do repeat shows with name switching! 
I should get a refund"
Mystere,"I am not someone that enjoys coming to Vegas because I dont particularly like drinking nor gambling. Yet, I have to try to appear to enjoy the things people of my generation enjoy, so I went to Vegas again. This time, I made it about me and made sure to do things I enjoy. One of which is seeing shows and experiencing art. 

This is the best show I have seen in my life and I was thoroughly entertained and impressed. I wont get into too many details, but I was in the second row and was blow away by the beauty and skill demonstrated in this show. I was even sprayed with some of the interactive aspects of the show with some water. I absolutely loved it. There are some truly strong and skilled people out there. It kind of inspired me to get my diet and exercise regime going!"
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil experience, and it definitely did not disappoint! We somehow landed front row tickets online for a surprisingly cheap price, and seeing the dancers and performers up front made for an amazing experience (though the theater is small enough that you can get a great view from anywhere, really). 

The show itself was just so spectacular - the vibrant colors, the variety of breathtaking acts, the music, and the focus on the pure talent and strength in the performers. I loved the duo of incredibly strong guys who balanced each others entire body weights in unreal ways, as well as the trapeze acts. Everything really was so mesmerizing. 

There were also lots of juvenile bits that involved audience interaction (I very much avoided eye contact) - a regular reminder that despite the adult-like finesse and grace, this was indeed a circus show. And for the most part it wasnt too ridiculously immature. (Except that ongoing adult baby bit. Ughhhhh fuck that baby. I feel bad for the adult performer who has to play that baby.) 

Doing a bit of research I learned that other Cirque du Soleil shows do have more storyline driven shows, whereas this one definitely is loose and maintains focus on the acrobatics rather than anything else, with the exception of the fucking weird baby subplot. I would definitely get tickets to another show and see more of what Cirque du Soleil has to offer. A great first time watching Cirque du Soleil in Vegas :)"
Mystere,"Ive seen quite a few other cirque shows in Vegas and I absolutely loved this show! We sat in the second section of seats in the front row, in the center, and we had a perfect view of the entire stage. I was hesitant when I heard about the large guy dressed as a baby, but I thought he too was hilarious. I think the show would be appropriate for guests of all ages. Im taking my friends to see it again in a few weeks. The acrobats were incredibly talented."
Mystere,"We had a grand ol time at Cirque du Soleil Mystère. I think Mystère is one of the more original/older shows, but it has everything youre looking for in a typical Cirque show.

The number of seats is pretty good. Its not too big, so pretty much all the seats have a good view. We kinda splurged and got lower level/center seats but I would have been perfectly happy in the back rows. If you have choice, then stay centered.

Theres a bit of audience interaction so good luck.

The popcorn was super salty. 

Parking is free.

Very happy with our experience. I can see why its such a long running show. The performers were very professional and hard-working."
Mystere,"Cirque du Soleil, what can you not like?! Theres a lot of crazy acrobatics moves! Good looking and in shape people performing. Get a few drinks in before the show for the enhancement! They do have a bar and popcorn station, so there ya have it! I think it was over an hour long, like watching a movie, but even better, not a dull moment! Got me on my toes, sitting at the edge of the seat, jaw dropping type of performance. Doooo it!"
Mystere,"Took my mother to this as a surprise Christmas present and we were both blown away! Looking at other reviews, it looks like this show has come a long way. We were both absolutely amazed at the energy and everything this production has to offer. It has mind blowing acrobatics, amazingly, talented performers, and is packed with action, humor, a variety of stunts and everything you would want. It feels like a show you would need to see multiple times because so much is constantly going on. The performers make every moment count. We were both hoping it wouldnt end. The voices, the music, the costumes, the lighting, everything was great. Definitely recommend seeing this amazing production."
Mystere,"There are so many different Cirque du Soleils to choose from in Vegas that it can be completely overwhelming. Having never been to a single one, we opted for the one with the cheapest tickets and left thoroughly impressed and wondering how much better the other ones could have been. 

The performance is visually overwhelming, and I mean that in a completely positive way. Your eye literally has no idea where to look because there are constantly five amazing things happening. Between the acrobatics, singing, humor and props, it was an absolutely amazing show. I wish there was some sort of grand finale, since I feel like they ended on a low note, but thats a small critique. 

Per the trend in Vegas, no seat is a bad seat. The incline between rows is great and all seats surround the whole stage perfectly. When Im in Vegas next, I would gladly pick their show again!"
Mystere,"Ill admit this is my first Cirque du Soleil show but it is not my first Las Vegas show. I spent a long time reading articles and reviews on which Cirque show would be the best for my first time and Mystère kept coming up as the best place to start. The website was easy to use and finding just the right seats with just the right view was a breeze. They even allow pictures during the show. I loved the music, the acrobats, and the comedy injected into the show makes it family friendly (I know it can be hard to find things for little ones in Vegas) I would recommend to anyone interested in seeing an amazing show."
Mystere,"Always an amazing show!  Went to the 930 show, 700 booked except for single seats on a saturday.  Book early"
Mystere,"WOW.....WOW....WOW.....this was my very FIRST Cirque show......and I am a fan for life. We received 50 buck show tickets from our timeshare property valued at 206.00 bucks retail. We had awesome seats (sec 105.....row 3.....seats 1-2) right near all of the action. You can reference the Pictures I posted and see that my Favorite acts were the STRONG MEN display as I call it....LOL!!!!! My other Favorite act was members of the cast climbing polls and performing some sick acrobatics on them. There was plenty of Comedy skits in between acts....and there was no intermission which I really appreciated. The show lasts 90 minutes.....the cast really interacts with the audience especially if your sitting in the lower areas near the stage like we were and it is just a really fun experience.

I am already planning to go to all of the Las Vegas Cirque shows over the next few years.....next up will hopefully be O next year at the Bellagio.....I will keep you all posted. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
Mystere,"Having done several cirque shows before, I can say with a certainty that this is one of the best. There are several different acts and amazing acrobatics.

Despite what the reviews say, although it is a small theater and the majority of seats are good, I recommend sitting first few rows of tier 2 to get the best experience."
Mystere,"This was an awesome experience.  The show was fun and enjoyable with the audience interaction.  I was laughing and left staring in awe of how they were able to do the things they do.  The best part of the show for me was when two of the artists went slowly through their act showing grace and strength, which was absolutely beautiful."
Mystere,This was my first circus du Soleil show.  And it was AMAZING. We cant wait to see another show.  I would HIGHLY recommend this show a thousand times.
Mystere,"Incredible show! My first Cirque de Soleil and it lived up to the hype. It is mesmerizing. Funniest parts were the big baby and his papa- beware if you are in the front rows, you may be included in the action. The 2 bald guys doing the hand to hand stuff was by far the most impressive and probably my favorite part. We arrived at 630pm for the 7pm show- plenty of time to get to seats, snacks etc. valet parking is free, btw! Just tip what youd like. The show is about an hour and a half. The concession stand within the theater has beer, wine, soda and water. All over priced so be prepared. $5 for water and soda. The wine comes in the single serving white glass thats just open and drink. Felt like a shot of wine really. Others brought in snacks and drinks which didnt seem to be a problem. Wish we had done that too! 
There are no bad seats in the theater. Our seats were 3rd row on the side and we had an incredible view. Would have liked a little further back so I didnt have to crane my neck all the way back to see the action literally right above our seats. 
Some of the visuals are the stuff of nightmares- face masks with elongated faces worn on the back of the heads and the long armed and legged characters all felt like something Tim Burton would dream up in color."
Mystere,"Mystère was the first of the Cirque du Soleils in Vegas, and appropriately the first Vegas show I ever saw. First time was late 90s, and it was one of those magical nights back when Vegas still held magic for me. Im old and jaded now. The performance was spectacular, but what really piqued my chi was the music. Hauntingly eloquent, and quite mystèrious!! Felt compelled to buy the CD after the curtains went down. Still listen to this very day. 
Years later took my wife to see it. Somehow we scored 6th row seats. Not bad. The storyline is a bit vague, if there is one. But the acrobatics are just amazing. The big baby keeps things light-hearted and draws the audience into the show. Some of the other Cirque shows have shown the maturation of the franchise, and some, depending on personal taste of course, would be considered more elaborate, more beautiful, or just better. Still, Mystère will always hold a place in my memories, as well as a spot in Vegas history, bringing in a new era of entertainment. Always a crowd pleaser, and unless youre culturally inept, you should have an enjoyable experience. Mystère: no boobies, but still a damn good show!!"
Mystere,"This was my first cirque de soleil show, and I was impressed. Came to the 7 oclock show on Christmas with my family. There was a line at the door at 6:30, but it went by really quick. They allow food inside, so I bought ice cream in to eat. Before the show and in between some acts, there was a clown who was suppose to be funny and went around in the audience throwing popcorn. The show was great but I was confused about the storyline. The baby was funny in between scene changes. I enjoyed watching the performers flying around, singing, and dancing. 

Overall I would recommend this because every part of it was enjoyable."
Mystere,"We had no idea what to expect being our first show.  So the expectations were pretty low.  I knew I wanted to check out at least one show but for the duration of our Vegas trip the Ka had been sold out for weeks ahead.  I figured since we wouldnt know if shows were our thing Id just chose any one and Mystere popped up.  All the reviews were great so I thought, cant go wrong.  Everyone I spoke with said all the cirque du soleil shows are amazing.  Reviews could not be more spot on.  Worth every minute and every cent.  They blew us away with the performance.  The acrobatics, the live song and dance, the theatrics before, during and after was all just mind blowing.  Ill admit that the reviews about things here and there not making sense, I can agree.  The big adult baby, the goof making trouble, the large creepy snail... alrighty!  But all that aside, I guess for entertainment and filling purposes, I can live with it.  So many times during the show my jaw dropped, I felt the hairs on my neck stand, chicken skin appeared.  Our first experience just sparked a love for cirque du soleil shows and we cant wait to see them all!  Highly recommended over and over again to any and everyone!"
Mystere,"There really isnt that much to say about this show that hasnt been said.

Its in the back of Treasure Island. Because there is no lobby like Ka and One, you end up with a HUGE line that stretches almost the length of the casino before the show. It really doesnt make sense to have that kind of a line considering that all seats are reserved, but whatever.

I really enjoyed the show, the colors, and the clown before the show. They even encouraged you to post on social media during the show. This is the only Cirque I have been to that encourages this.

If you have never seen a Cirque and dont want to give up $100+ per ticket, then I would definitely recommend this one! I would see it again if I can get tickets at a reasonable price."
Mystere,"Without a doubt, five stars for the incredible acrobatic performances. The strength, flexibility and grace of all the performers was absolutely amazing and I found myself gasping at their astonishing tricks over and over again. That said, the show did lose me a bit at the extremely strange story line featuring the overgrown baby, who managed to occasionally be funny but most of the time was more annoying than anything. 

I hadnt done any research on the show before I went so I had no idea what to expect as far as the story. The man baby opening the show by playing with his red bouncy ball wasnt what I was expecting and I was very confused about how it would all fit together. Even after discussing it with my friends after the show and coming to the conclusion that the fantastical creatures must have been a part of the babys imagination, I still dont really see the need for the character. 

Honestly, I would have been perfectly content to just watch the acrobats in their amazing costumes do their thing. I didnt need the attempted comedic relief to break up the show. As someone who would be very uncomfortable being the center of attention, I also wasnt a big fan of the audience participation. It seemed awkward and unnecessary. 

But the jaw dropping tricks saved the show for me. How could you not be fascinated by the things these talented people could do? I cant even do a push up and theyre flying through the air and balancing on top of people and poles! 

The theater is intimate and theres a good seat from practically anywhere. We got the tier 3 tickets, which are the back few rows throughout the theater, and we still felt plenty close to the action. In fact, I thought our seats might even provide a better view for some of the stunts that featured performers flying through the air. 

If youre staying at T.I., talk to the ticket booth about getting a discount on show tickets. We were able to get buy one, get one, which came to about $65 each."
Mystere,"The family enjoyed the show quite a bit.  This was our first Cirque du Soleil show that we have watched, so we dont have much to compare it to, but we all had a good time.  Little interactive portions, with funny bits to keep the mood light, as well as amazing acrobatics.  Make sure to give yourself a LOT of time to get here as traffic along the strip is heavy, and may make you late."
Mystere,"An absolute must see!! This show had everything I expected in from Cirque Du Soleil. The story and acrobatics were amazing! The acrobats do the unthinkable and theyre amazing! Our seats were second row and I highly suggest getting seats higher up. The stage moves up and down, therefore seating further back from the stage youll be able to absorb the entire show.

Loved the show- highly recommend it!"
Mystere,"This is such a great Cirque du Soleil show! It is the oldest and most traditional on the strip I would say. The acrobats, trapeze, silks, dancers, everything was amazing.

The theatre isnt too large, and being further away is a plus because so much is going on in front of you, on the sides of you, and above you its nice to be able to take everything in. The performers were very talented and each act was executed perfectly. The show was very colorful, lively, and high energy.

I was in awe at the strength, agility, flexibility, and pure passion these performers had! I can barely do 10 girl push ups and these performers made everything look so gracious and flawless and easy even though its very difficult.

My favorite performance was the trapeze at the very end. I was sitting at the edge of my seat for this performance so nervous that someone would be dropped. 

Overall, if you have never seen a Cirque du Soleil I would highly recommend starting with this one. The pricing is decent, typically $70-$120 per ticket. During slow times of the year they have even better pricing available as well so make sure to look around."
Mystere,"October 10 2017, 930 Show time. 

Man what a disappointment. We have book our tickets originally for 7pm but our tickets were cancelled and they moved us to the 930 show. Over booking? Probably... we got our tickets 4 months ago.... 

Anyway as any other tourist in Vegas We have booked a couple for shows for our 3 night stay and Mystere was one of them. We line up at 845pm since people are already lining up. 9pm doors open. Upon getting in the set was good , but it stops there..... 

We were in our seats u til 940pm and was informed that they were having some issues and will play soon. 

The crowd started clapping and chanting, since everyone is getting excited to watch the show. Lets goo!!

10pm came and an announcement was made that the show just got cancelled. What the F.  We waited for so long for nothing and we cant even watch another show since we were there for a good hour! I know issues happens but there wasnt any formal apologies made, and who ever was talking wasnt professional at all. Just a refund and sorry. We wasted a night of on our stay, and we werent even supposed to be on that time slot! 

Cirque is such a big company and sought after, but whatever happened that night, i hope that it doesnt happened again. The tourist gets affected alot at this point and ruins the vacation."
Mystere,"Ive seen a little bit of Cirque in my life, not tons but Id say at least a dozen plus shows but have never seen Mystère. We were in town for a quick little getaway and Id planned on possibly seeing Zumanity as I havent seen it before and was looking for something sexy and a bit more edgy than the others.

My boyfriend had mentioned he once purchased seats to see this show but ended up selling them because his friends didnt want to see it. I then thought it would be more fun for him to have a chance to finally see this show. We can see the other some other time.

We walked up to the box office 30 minutes prior to the show time and were able to get seats. The theatre was not full at all and they had plenty of seats. There cant possible be a bad seat in the house.

The show was good, and kept me engaged throughout. I dont know that Id say its my favorite ever but its definitely worth being thrown into the option pool when in town and looking for Cirque. I love O and Le Reve but some of the acts here were just as good. Seriously made me re think my once a week Pop Pilates class. These people are so talented and so strong! Its incredible to see.

The only bad part about seeing this show is enduring the hotel and snack bar. Absolutely terrible! Its located in Treasure Island and the place just made my skin crawl from the second we walked through the door. Felt more like Laughlin! Once getting into the theatre I had high hopes of ordering a nice glass of wine and forgetting we were at Treasure Island, unfortunately the beverage selection adult and soda was horrifying. I ended up with a box of Junior Mints and my boyfriend had popcorn, which wasnt terrible. I shared a little bit of it with him.

Once the lights go down and the show starts you forget where you are and can enjoy the entertainment, once its over we literally ran like hell (yes, even in 5 inch heels) to get the heck out of this dump! Its scary old, and feels super grimy. 

Mystère would be even better if it were presented in a better hotel, but as one of the very first cirque shows its surely worth seeing!"
Mystere,"You cant go wrong seeing any of the Cirque du Soliel shows. But this one I especially liked because it kept me interested and the performers were outstanding.
Get there early to avoid the long lines or wait until the line has gone down. We arrived at 9:05 and line line went way way back. But the line does move fast."
Mystere,"This is the second Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas, the other was Love. I stayed at Harrahs and came to Treasure Island for the first time. I got an okay ticket about $78 buck at the very top Section. So I was far away, The music was awesome. Very foreign, mysterious and seductive. I noticed that there were a lot of Aerial acrobatics of the show. And one of the guy from the show keep throwing popcorn into the audience, I thought that was annoying. The whole show was great. I like the section with the 2 guys doing the strength test, and other very high aerial stunts up in the air. They are very strict with photography, one of the usher woman was keeping tab on people who taking pics. Anyway, I couldnt really follow the storyline of the show but Mystere has it good and bad moments. But overall, I did enjoy it. This is an okay good show to see if you like Cirque, I still like Love a little bit better. :) 4 stars"
Mystere,"Wow! These people are amazing dare devils! I was entertained and kept me awoke after a buffet! lol 

Pros:
alot of stunts.
very acrobatic.
funny old guy picking on the people in the stand.
amazing performances from every strong individual to the big fat baby to the old guy.

Cons:
about $100/person!
no videos but photos ok.
seats are too 90deg.

Overal very entertaining for about 1 1/2 hours. Worth the price!"
Mystere,Ive never been to a Cirque du Soleil show before so this was a brand new experience for me. I was super impressed by this show. The theatrics were cool and all of the stunts were incredible. There was also a little humor to keep you involved. Id definitely recommend this show!
Mystere,"Located in the Treasure Island theater, this is the longest running Cirque du Soleil show on the Vegas strip. The theater is nice and seats are very comfortable. The performers are quite talented. The physical comedy is very funny. Its worth the ticket price to see this."
Mystere,"There is no clear way to explain Mystere but let me try. 

Every single Cirque du Soleil show has some sort of theme or premise. Mystère is a mystery and combines so many elements that are very confusing. The show starts with two crying babies onstage. Then evolves into these two babies being full grown adult babies. One will scream for his papa the whole time and the other is amazing at backflips. Then out of nowhere you will suddenly see the stage drop 20-30 feet into the ground. Now a giant snail appears. They also had spider looking people climbing on the walls. Some traditional circus acts like the trapeze. It also included a bungee trapeze! Hopefully you wont get locked inside of the box onstage! ;) Overall I still have no clue what the plot line of this show was. 

Even though I didnt understand the story, I would still return! That show was insanely beautiful! The acts were phenomenal and so impressive! 

My seats:
I was in Row C in the section closest to stage right. Now I really loved these seats! The downside to lower seats is the times you will have to look up when viewing the trapeze and anything above. They do utilize the whole arena. So they had moments in the roof, on the stage, in the aisles, in the crowd, above the crowd, etc. Legitimately there is no bad seat(unless youre one of the unfortunate souls they drag onstage). 

This show is very unique and unlike any other Cirque show! I highly recommend this show because it creates a unique environment inside the whole theater. 

When leaving the theater have a lot of patience! There is only one door. So it is a funnel out that door for about 1,200 people. Then you realize that 95% of the people will be heading out to the strip and turning right. Well now youre stuck in the traffic near The Mirage and its volcano. So for a faster exit, pass through The Mirage, then pass through Caesars, and continue that till you reach your destination. 

Go see the show and have a blast!"
Mystere,"If you have never seen a Cirque du Soleil show before like me, then I highly recommend this one.

A beautiful show that will keep making you say Wow"
Mystere,"An AMAZING show! Ive seen it a couple of times already. This past time we had front row seats. This is a great show if you like stunts and acrobatics! It is jam packed with incredible stunts throughout the entire show.

TIP: Portions of the show are interactive with the audience so if you have a parent or someone youd love to see in the show, sit close to the stage in the front row! I was sitting front row, right of center (looking at the stage) and I got pulled into an act. Fun stuff!! Those were the 2 places that they pulled people from so good luck! 

Great experience, great show!"
Mystere,"This was an all-around lovely experience. After watching several Cirque du Soleil trailers, I decided on Mystere. Since Ive never been to a Cirque du Soleil show, I went in with malleable expectations.

Although the story is difficult to follow, I loved the physicality of the performance. My favorite portions involved the swinging acrobatics and gymnastic numbers. It was enthralling.

If I ever find myself back in Las Vegas, Ill definitely go see some other shows--Ka, La Reve, and O seem right my alley."
Mystere,"Cirque du Soleil is a name that is synonymous with high quality entertainment. The shows are large, the costumes are intriguing, and the acts have at least some element of comedy or intimacy. Mystere is no different from that formula although as a show, it is much better as an entry into the world of Cirque du Soleil than one youll want to watch as your fifth or sixth Cirque show. 

Mystere is fantastic in the fact where there really is no bad seat in the house. The seating is only for a couple hundred so even though the seating arrangement might looking daunting, even if you are in the back you are able to see the show well. Because of that, getting tickets to this show are rather easy and inexpensive. You can either purchase ahead of time on their own personal website, in person at the ticket office, or as I would recommend, go to one of those Tix 4 Tonite kiosks and buy some tickets there because they are usually cheaper. We got tickets for Section 2 at $92 a piece and ended up sitting only four seats away from the front of the stage. 

The show has great atmosphere, seating where no bad seats in the house, a mesmerizing set, and affordable prices. This is the Cirque du Soleil show you should check out if you want to see what all the hype is about when it comes to the world of Cirque du Soleil."
Mystere,"So I toyed with the idea of giving this performance 4 stars due to its juvenile tendencies but then I remembered; its a circus. If you enter this performance with that mindset you will enjoy the show. 
It starts with a quirky gentlemen pretending to help patrons to their seats but ends up running them in circles and spraying them and other patrons with water and popcorn. The show officially begins with Baby Huey (showing my age; just google the name) reuniting with his long lost father. Tender and hilarious. Baby Huey continues to re-emerge throughout the show; so does the quirky gentleman. Both characters add a heart warming laugh to the depth defying stunts.
The high flying acrobatics are extremely impressive. From strongman demonstrations to flying trapeze acts, this show really pays tribute to a lot of the traditional circus acts we know and love, minus the bearded lady and elephants. The performers really seem to enjoy what they do and are very skilled at their craft.
It is a great show for the entire family."
Mystere,"This is the best Cirque show Ive seen. The main reason is because I actually genuinely laughed. The show starts before the show starts, if you catch my drift. The theater smells just like buttered popcorn, which for me is a major plus. You can bring in non alcoholic beverages and but the alcohol inside the venue.

The act gives you a chance to truly appreciate the strength and talent of the cast. I left bring confused about the plot, but memorized by everyones acrobatic feats. You will be memorized by watch you watch. You will have the chance to engage with the cast. You will also get to hear live music seeing the tone.

You wont fall asleep, even if you are really tired. Bring your friends and family; its a show all can easily enjoy."
Mystere,This was my 3rd time seeing Mystere and my kids first Cirque show.  It was so fun seeing it through their eyes.  It brought back some of the magic for me.  I think Mystere is a great beginner Cirque show.  It isnt my favorite but honestly we are a little spoiled with 7 Cirque shows on the strip.  I think it is a stretch to call Criss Angel a Cirque show but that is an argument for another review.  Even though it is not my favorite it is still an excellent show.  The performers are amazing.  Every time I see it I notice something I missed before.  If you have never seen a Cirque show and are not into MJ or the Beatles I would recommend seeing Mystere.
Mystere,"GREAT CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW. Very good story line, amazing acrobatics, breathtaking costumes. AKA: pure Cirque. Simply an amazing show, and believe me, I have seen 10 Cirque du Soleil shows!"
Mystere,"Loved it! This show had a little of everything, it was phenomenal from start to finish!!!"
Mystere,"Im really glad this was my first Cirque show! I wasnt sure what to expect and going in with a blank slate was really beneficial in a show like this. It added to the sense of mystery around the story line (not that I know now what the story line is...).

The acts ranged from acrobats to taiko drummers to aerial performers to trapezists. All of the acts were phenomenal and showcased a variety of circus talents in an artistic way. Im biased, but I wish the taiko drumming act was longer! In between the acts, there were a few hosts that engaged with the audience. Im not sure if these are permanent actors or seasonal additions. They were amusing but they dont add to the value of the show.

Purchase tickets ahead of time! I chose the second best seats (theater chooses seating) and the view was great. Dont splurge on this one and youll still have a good time."
Mystere,"I actually saw Mystere for the first time way back in 2008. That was my very first time attending a Cirque show and I was blown away! Since that time I have been able to enjoy Beatles Love, Zumanity, Ka(although enjoy is being generous in this case), and MJ One. I wondered how my opinion of Mystere might change given this new perspective.

I still love this show and it may very well be my favorite Cirque of them all! This just feels like the quintessential Cirque Du Soliel/Las Vegas experience!

Some highlights for me included..

- the act with the two strongmen was beyond impressive! Seriously. Not only the strength...but the balance displayed under pressure was incredibly impressive!
- the comedy relief was very amusing and I loved how they included audience members in the skits as well! ...just as long as it wasnt me! lol
- I loved the wacky costumes and sets. Very reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland in parts. Actually some of these scenes look like they were designed during some kind of hardcore acid trip! This is only underscored when the finale ends with a massive rainbow colored snail overtakes the stage...I liked all of it though!
- this is the Cirque that is the most circus like with plenty of acrobatics and stunts...which is what I want to see when I go to a Cirque show!

other items of note..

- the big baby just kind of freaked me out a little bit. There were still some funny moments during the show with him, but overall I feel like I could have done without it
- during the part of the show with the performers on the see-saws one of the performers was having a rough night and botched a couple of spots and looked visibly agitated. I felt so bad for the guy. These stunts are so crazy tough, Im sure you cant nail them all. 
- this is easily the most affordable Cirque on the strip with tickets starting at $65 and discounts very easy to get. If you have never seen a Cirque before, this would be the perfect one to start with!

Everybody has their own opinion and preference when it comes to these shows, but I thoroughly enjoyed Mystere yet again and wouldnt be surprised if I ended up seeing it again very soon.

5 stars!"
Mystere,"Well. I dont enjoy clubbing and I dont enjoy drinking so what else could I do that is sedentary and I dont have to do much work?

Watch a show, of course.

My first every Vegas show and oh my gosh. This was the highlight of my Vegas trip. 
Amazing, amazing, fantastically amazing performance by highly skilled performers. Mystère was great. I still dont understand the plot but regardless, I was astounded by the level of skills and talents of the performers. There were a few mistakes I saw but it doesnt deter from the greatness of the show. 

Any seat is a good seat because the theatre is small and they really use the entire stage. We bought tickets a month ago? As we were waiting in line, we overheard people paying $151 per ticket. Wow. 

Great for all ages and you can even bring outside food and drinks in! Theres also a bar in the theatre for drinks and snacks. 

No flash photography for the safety of the performers. Security comes around and will warn you. 

A lot of people came late and thats just disrespectful since they obscured views and didnt bother making the effort to be on time for such a great show."
Mystere,"All of the Cirque shows are impressive in their own way, but this show wasnt my favorite of the four Ive seen so far. 

Before the show I read that Mystere was the first Cirque show on The Strip. Everything from the theatre to the style of the show indicated that this was true. Not a bad thing! I could just tell that everything has become more grand since the original. The theatre is intimate with less seating than some of the other shows, but it didnt look like there would be a bad seat in the theatre. The stage was as impressive as the other stages with moving parts and changes in the stage during the show.

This show has the most audience participation than the other shows. The entertainment begins before the show even starts. This show is more a variety of Cirque du Soleils impressive acts and comedy. The music never stops with giant drums and two women that sing the entire time. Some of the acts in this show will blow your mind with their talent. 

Overall, its Cirque du Soleil so its still a very impressive show. This show is just more of a blend of comedy and acts than back to back acts like some of the other shows."
Mystere,Loved this! It was my first experience with cirque &amp; made a fan of me for life. So much to see all happening g at once could keep me coming back often. Costumes are magnificent. Theres an innocence about this production that pulls us into the experience with the cast. Its unequaled anywhere Ive been
Mystere,"Because we partner with Cirque du Soleil for a production every year we got free tickets to see this show! I honestly didnt know what to expect because I had been on the stage the week before and was going to hit the stage the following week. 

I was completely blown away. In Cirque-fashion, this show had a variety of acts, but this was on more of a circus side, as opposed to Zumanity (also a fantastic show!). My favorite act was the two gentlemen that pressed each other in very unbelievable ways. The amount of diligence, and strength is unfathomable.

This is definitely an in-your-face show. From stunt after stunt. Quite phenomenal. The clowns are completely hilarious and help break up the show into digestible acts.

I highly recommend this show, if you havent seen it before! 

TIP: You can get a deal if you stay at Treasure Island. 
TIP: theres a nice dinner + show package you can find on the TI website!"
Mystere,"Excellent show, great family theme too.  The acrobatics is amazing to watch and the cast does a great job engaging the crowd.  I sat in the middle section and had a great view.  Section 202 row HH seats 26 and 27 were great. You werent too close but not too far either so for me it was a perfect balance."
Mystere,"Great show. I went with my wife and her parents. I firmly believe that all cirque shows are spectacular. However, after seeing about 5 of them along with some other similar strip shows, Im starting to see a pattern with every single one of them. There appears to be about a dozen concepts the get recycled at every cirque show but they just repackage them with different colors and music. Every show, theres one scene where people twirl around on ropes, or another where two buff dudes balance each other in ways that would burst my spleen, or a guy on a tumbling death wheel. These shows need some more originality in my opinion. More importantly, these shows are predominately loaded with shirtless buff guys, but theres only like two women in these shows. Dont get me wrong, Ive enjoyed every cirque show Ive ever been to, but lets bump it up a notch on the originality aspect."
Mystere,This show was great! I was captivated the entire show. These performers are really something else. Wow so impressive! I would recommend this show to anyone whos in Vegas!
Mystere,"Even though I had seen this years ago watching it again was such a treat.
A huge shout out to the cast they perform twice a day nearly the whole year but they give it their all every performance.
We were sitting in the front row and it was such an exciting experience.
The performers are all very buff and their costumes are immaculate as are the sets.
Many of the cast members are the same from many years ago but time has not dampened their enthusiasm.
We could not stop clapping and up close could see the beautiful smiles and positive exuberance.
The entire performance was just mind blowing and a feast visually.The singers and the orchestra/musicians outstanding.
My wife was enraptured by the entire performance.
The sets were magnificent as was the theatre.
Bravo Bravo Bravo. 
Thank you to the entire cast really made our Vegas vacation memorable.
There is audience participation but generally it is done with consent beforehand."
Mystere,"This was my first time watching a Cirque du Soleil show and I loved it! My boyfriend was able to get us free tickets.

The show was full of entertainment. I enjoyed it immensely. As a former dancer, I caught a few mistakes during the acts but nonetheless I was still in awe. Its amazing to see how all these different acts come together in unity. I was amazed by the performers strength, flexibility, performance and execution. It definitely inspired me to get back into dancing. 

The theater is very intimate so any seat would suffice for good viewing. 
 
I loved everything about this show. I highly recommend it!"
Mystere,"The show was great overall.  Very nice choreographies and very engaging with the audience (some scenes might  have been improv).  The acrobats were also amazing (the 2 older tough guys in the white pants)

There were some scenes that were a bit awkward and a bit uncomfortable for my taste (weird baby scene).  To each its own.

We sat fairly close and there was a lot going on.  To me I would have preferred to sit a bit further to have a full view of everything going on. 

The length of the show was also great, not too short not too long.
 
35% Military discount.  Thanks"
Mystere,"As a lover of live theatre and a local to Las Vegas, I am slowly working my way through all the shows on the strip. This particular one was a treat from a friend who got us fantastic seats House Right just 3 rows from the stage. 

Now, I precede all of this by saying what these performers can repeatedly do with their bodies is incredible, and each individual act was as diverse and impressive as the next. But, on the whole, the show just really felt like I was tripping on something super strong. 

The show begins with two prams and the sound babies crying. Personally, I dont find that sound to be very pleasant, but after a very fat man-baby began his comedy routine I was immediately turned off. This is not to say that the audience member  he chose to interact with wasnt a great team player (he was!) but I just dont find adult baby humor very...humorous. The Clown Usher however, was a blast and his acts were quite funny.

I just couldnt wrap my head around what the story of this show was supposed to be or the intended progression of these two infants (the fat boy/man baby and the little girl.) Every Cirque show has a specific history and theme and this one was absolutely lost on me. Most of the audience didnt even realize the show was over when the acrobats entered for their final bows because the conclusion was so weak. 

However, Mystère was the first resident Cirque show in the history of the company, (93) so it could be that these abstract themes hadnt yet morphed into the more story-driven cirque productions of today.  

I would say this show is best for families with smaller children. Theyll be amazed at the colors and the costumes and big baby and the tickets are less expensive than some of the other Cirque productions. Im glad I saw it, but I wouldnt care to see it again."
Mystere,"Mixed reviews on this one. The theater was small,  some parts are exciting to watch but hard to follow. I cant say Id take another family member or visiting guest to see this."
Mystere,"So, this is my 3rd Cirque show and I was excited because it has rave reviews online. Well, I have no idea how it has such high ratings. The entire thing was really....bizarre and not in a good way. I left after 45 minutes because I was so disappoint. The lady at the door told me it gets good at the end, but I couldnt stand it any longer. 

First of all, the show itself was a lot slower than most Cirque shows. There wasnt nearly as much acrobatics as I would expect from a cirque show. The music was ok, very fitting to the show which means it was slow. 

I guess Im not artistic enough to understand this show, because I had NO idea what the plot was. The characters were incredibly bizarre, and not in a good way. Featuring a grown ass man in a diaper acting like a baby, which I cant really judge peoples fetishes, but I didnt find it funny. There were quite a few pregnant imps dancing around. And one homo erotic portion with a pregnant woman on a rotating platform? I also wasnt nearly as impressed with the acrobatics as the rest of the audience. I also didnt find any part of it funny? 

The theatrics are good, but I would have rather seen a different, less triply show. 

I saved this for the very end, because if you made it this far I feel like you should know. If you have EVER done psychedelics DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOW. It will trigger flashbacks and not in a good way. The ultimate reason I had to leave is this show made me so uncomfortable because of the acid trip style mixed with demonic looking imps dancing around stage and the perfect bad trip music."
Mystere,"Having now seen three Cirque shows, its easy to see why Mystere is so highly rated, its fantastic.

From the hilarious antics of Albert Einstein in the 15 minutes before the show started to the grand finale, it was a spectacular experience. There were several times where I wasnt even sure where to focus my attention, there were so many amazing things going on. Humor, intrigue, and a touch of sensuality combined to make this a phenomenal show. If you can see just one Cirque show, see this one--ticket prices are cheaper than O and its a more intimate theater.

My only issue is that the narrative could be stronger as its not easy to discern what the show is really about--yet that didnt detract from the experience at all!"
Mystere,It is truly a great show. Such an amazing performances. Live music beautifully narrates the story along with breathtaking performances. I had a great time at the show. They greatly interact with the audience with a dash of humor. Try to buy tickets for mid rows but they can cost more.
Mystere,"It never ceases to amaze me what the human body can do. The artists of Mystere are beautiful, lithing, living pieces of art, and the musicians are so composed. 
Mystere is located in a huge venue, with good views all around. We sat front and center, and loved every minute of the show. 
My favorites were the baby, and the trapeze artists who flew the air. I held my breath watching them!
Audience participation will happen, so if youre shy, dont sit in the front. 
Kids would love watching the artists in their beautiful costumes."
Mystere,"Oh wow. Colorful. This was my first Cirque show and pretty much everything I imagined when Cirque du Soleil comes to mind. The acrobatics are incredible! The two bodybuilders balancing on each other were so graceful yet strong. They made my aunt giggle quite a bit. I was delighted the seats our AAA travel agent booked were high enough to enjoy watching the performers descend from the ceiling. The front sections must strain their necks. Lots of death defying acts in the show, including an acrobat moving her way around a metal bar prism above the ground. 

Whimsical. Jest. Color. Adrenaline. 

The giant snail at the end is kind of creepy though. 

Id say opt for this performance if you havent experienced Cirque. Discounted tickets available and theyre as low as $55!"
Mystere,Fun first cirque show. My wife and 8 year old son also really enjoyed it. Quite the mix if happenings no real theme but great displays of athleticism and costume. Its five stars if you havent seen one before. If you have then try one instead.
Mystere,"(This is probably closer to 3.5 stars to me.)  I didnt get the story, which is usual for me for the few Cirque du Soleil shows Ive seen; however, this was a bright, colorful, and lively performance.  At times, there was far too much going on around, over,and below the stage for me to keep track of, which was a bit frustrating while also exciting in the assault on your senses.  The acrobats/gymnasts (especially those on the see-saw and trampolines) and the strong men were particularly amazing, as were the drummers.  It was definitely enjoyable."
Mystere,"I would never have bothered to review this show. Except...  although it was mildly horrific to experience, one of the performers during our particular show experienced a mishap - forcing an interruption and 911 level attention by medical staff...  Medical staff who MUST be standing by during every moment of every show.  This, unfortunately and horrifically, served to demonstrate how absolutely dangerous the acrobatic stunts that the actors in this show perform really are. 
They make it look so easy. But, virtually every activity in this show is literally defying death. 
And, these stunts - almost 2 hours worth - are absolutely amazing to watch!
Go see Mystère!
You will not be disappointed!!"
Mystere,"Oh man, where to start!? This was my first Cirque show, and honestly, everything I expected! The effects, costume, characterizations, just all around talent involved in these shows is amazing, and the acrobatic scenes? Forget about it. I was a bit intoxicated as we watched the 9:30 Pm show but i was convinced that had nothing to do with my confusion. I mean their was story, but i could not figure out the story whatsoever! It def. has to do with my naiveness, I am so young and have experienced so little but this show, oh man spectacular! It will not bet my last Cirque, I am already interested now in the one at Dodger Stadium this year in LA! 

There is no photography during the show, but come on, people are going to do it, as i did; but this guy behind us insisted on smacking my chair every time I pulled out my camera as if he were an employee or the police. Like come on man, that seriously just irritated me as much as he was in the right, people, mind your own business (there was no screen light either it was turned off so he was doing it to make a point (He had to have been staying at the PrimmaDonna) LOL. Sorry Thespians I will take more respect into account when viewing art ;)

Go see this show tho seriously! Not a bad seat in the house as well, actually the front row as EVERYONE has said may not actually be the best seats because their is a lot of round about interaction with the from audience as well as stuff going on near the ceiling so I would honestly say we personally had the beast seats in the house right smack dab in the middle of the theater in the middle row ;) Paying middle money haha.. Now to that, tix were $80 a piece for those mid row seats but this was 2 months before hand. Driving into Vegas and all around their were advertisements for buying one ticket and getting another for only $50 so people def saved money but hey, I got my seats ahead of time and they were excellent so no complaints on my end. Hope my next cirque show is just as freakin awesome! ;D"
Mystere,"WOW WOW WOW !!! We (myself, my husband, and our 9 yr old), were completely blown away by this show!! I could watch it a 100 times and never get tired of it. I couldnt decide which show to see since there are just so many but I was so happy I choose this one! I cant wait to come back to Vegas and see the other productions- they all look amazing. We saw the Blue Man Group while we in town and it did not EVEN compare. Im not kidding it didnt hold a candle to Mystere! Treasure Island is kind of run down, being that it is an older hotel and hasnt been redone recently- but dont let that fool you, this show is pure enjoyment!"
Mystere,"I went there with my family first time in New Years Eve.
It was my first CDS experience and I truly loved their performances . From start to finish I enjoyed every aspect of the show , Yes it is a bit  strange show since there is no much making sense going on there but I guess this is the part of the art and it is very beautiful . I am planning on visiting the rest of the shows and enjoying in full . Definitely recommended !"
Mystere,First time seeing this show last night and it was awesome we had amazing seats second row from the stage. I would come back and watch it again great acrobats.
Mystere,"Another great Cirque show in the books :)

First off, you definitely have to call in to the box office and see what promotions they have going on... if you call in advance, you will definitely save $$$ AND get great seats! 

Now on to the show... like others have mentioned, the storyline does jump around from different scenarios and does get a bit confusing at times, but one thing Mystere does not lack is the amazing acrobatics Cirque de Soleil is well known for!

The nicer thing about Mystere over KA which we watched last year, was that this show definitely made us laugh more... It sounds goofy, I know... but before the show even started, the popcorn guy we shall call him, had (most of) the whole crowd laughing right off the bat. It was a nice start to the show :)

Anyway, these Cirque shows are all well worth the money in my opinion. If its your first time trying to see one of these, definitely try Mystere... youll laugh, be amazed at the acrobatic skill level, and wont be disappointed!"
Mystere,"You see by my receipts my party and I arrived 40 minutes before the show!  The line was so long we decided to get drinks. By the time we returned the line had moved. We had to dump over $80.00 plus tip worth of drinks!  The manger stated, Per our policy we cannot allow drinks from the outside. Outside is two feet outside the curtain in the casino. He tells me I could of drank them. He cut me off without courtesy or an apology and curtly told me,you are done now."
Mystere,We loved the performance. The joker was annoying but funny.We will love to see the show again. It was well worth the money.
Mystere,"I have seen both Ka and Zarkana, both were amazing with their own story line. This show did not have a story line and it seemed like a bunch of acts thrown together. Dont get me wrong, the performer were great at their own acts, but it was incoherent. I would not pay full price for this show."
Mystere,"Amazing!!! This was our very first Cirque du Soleil show and we were mesmerized throughout the whole show. Great music, incredible performances, colorful costumes. A truly incredible feast for the senses. Some of the acts were amazing with incredible human strength and flexibility. A great show for adults and kids alike. Prices are cheaper compared with other Cirque du Soleil shows. A must see when you are in Vegas."
Mystere,"Wow, wow, wow. Insane entertainment, cool tricks and fun environment. This is my second Cirque show and its so hard to compare the two. Mystère had lots of humor, audience interaction and many ohhs and ahhs. Pure entertainment and worth every penny"
Mystere,"This was a wonderful performance with lots of nonstop action. There was always something on the stage to capture your attention and keep you interested. Even when there wasnt acrobats flying around or impressive displays of the human body, the comic relief put on by the mischievous character was highly entertaining."
Mystere,"Simply amazing. Its like a variety show, not a story like some shows. It was amazing, totally awesome just like out of this world. They are world class performers better than Olympic performers. I was in awe the entire time. Loved it. Would Rec, would take visitors from out of town (I live here) and will go again."
Mystere,"For years, weve been wanting to see a Cirque du Soleil performance, and this was our first opportunity to do so.  It was WELL WORTH the wait!!  Both of us just loved our experience with Mystere.  The show is funny and engaging and awe-inspiring, with some of the most incredible aerial acrobatics that weve ever seen.  A+ all the way."
Mystere,"An incredible night!

There are many Cirque de Soleil shows to choose from in Las Vegas, and I chose this one based on it being the original one.

I purchased my ticket on the day, but not from the box office, but a retailer who offered the tickets at a discounted price due to it being day of, so felt I got a great deal. 

The performers were astounding. From start to finish I cannot think of a single moment when j wasnt transfixed by the feats and stunts they performed. 

There are so very many shows to choose from in Vegas, and I guess there is no right or wrong, but - for me - this was an incredible experience, and I would definitely advise you to check it out.

It lasts just under two hours, is not too loud, appropriate for all ages (though maybe not very small children?) and a wonderful treat!"
Mystere,"Theres been a few Cirque shows that I havent really cared for, but I would definitely recommend this one. It had some comedy and some great acts. We got seats that were really close to the stage and they were ok, but I think if you sit a bit further back, youll have a better view of everything going on since theres so much to see. These are such amazing performers and will keep you wanting more. The big baby is pretty hilarious too. Who knows, you may be picked to be the lucky daddy. I think its good for all ages. Lots of talent packed into one show. Cirque shows do get expensive, but if youre here for a special occasion or just want to see something fantastic, its worth the cost."
Mystere,I always wanted to see a cirque show.  I obviously picked the average one.  We were told no phones were allowed but I still managed to take a grainy photo.  The show was so average I passed out.  No drinking just people crammed into a all theater. It was not so great but not so bad when I was asleep.
Mystere,"GO SEE THIS SHOW! Totally worth it.

This was my first ever Cirque du Soleil show and I had no idea what to expect. The beginning was weird and almost creepy, but then the show became spectacular. There are so many things to look at - people are crawling on the wall next to you, people are flying across the stage, people dancing in the background. If youre seated way up in the front, dont be alarmed if youre brought on stage and are part of the show! 

Its incredible what these peoples bodies are capable of and how much flexibility/strength/balance these people have. Its truly unbelievable. Really beautiful show, I definitely want to attend more shows in the future!"
Mystere,"Love this show!!!! Ive seen it many many many times over the years and held number one on my list for ever! Until I saw the Beatles show! 
I just love all the props and the characters in the show! Lots of great acts, lots to see and enjoy! Great for all ages!!!!! Especially the little ones! Go and see it!"
Mystere,"What a magical and surprising spectacle! The medley of different artistic performances keep things fresh. 
I had a great seat."
Mystere,I cant say more than what many of the five star reviews have already said. This is just a truly entertaining show. The performers were top notch. I either had a smile on my face or was gasping in awe.  Highly recommend this show.
Mystere,"I didnt expect this to be as great as the other Cirque shows, since its the original. I figured theyd get better over the years and the set wouldnt blow my mind as much or something, but I couldnt have been more wrong. Mystere has aged amazingly well and Im sure they update it like they do all other Cirque shows, but the theatre and the sets are still phenomenal. I highly recommend this show!"
Mystere,This is my 2nd time visiting Mystere show.  Ticket vouchers were purchased at discounted price from tickets4tonight booth for $71 per person.   Then we went to Mystere box office to exchange our vouchers for actual ticketd. Surprised we got pretty good seats too.  The performance and music were good.  I just felt that they had reduce the number of acts and performers compared to the past.  Show started at 9:30pm and ended before 11:15pm.
Mystere,"Literally nothing to not like about this show. Have seen cirque shows before but this one blows them all away, even the clowns were funny borderline hilarious(dont ever like the clown part of the show normally). So well rounded the acrobatics were astounding and jaw dropping at times, the audience participation was well thought out, and the music was perfectly crafted to fit the movements. Laughed out loud, was awed, especially by the two men balancing upon one another and holding each other up with hamstrings and sheer strength of will. To go from stomach to back while balancing a human body with your legs is mind numbing. From beginning to end was wholly entertained, this is the best true to roots cirque show on the strip, I promise you will not be disappointed one iota by Mystère, one of the premiere shows on the strip for anyone. And for the great price, it cant be beat."
Mystere,"GREAT SHOW!!!

The acrobatics were AMAZING!!!

Sometimes....a bit too much going on and hard to follow the story line, but the costumes and acrobatics make up for it

MUST SEE!!!"
Mystere,"Dont bother buying tickets for this show, my fiancé was assaulted by a fellow guest in line and the company refused to help us in any way or refund our tickets. I will never go to another cirque performance again and everyone I know will be told about this. Justin the manager was rude and did not care whatsoever, and the ushers and guard did nothing. Screw cirque du Soleil, Im speaking to my lawyer once I get back home tomorrow"
Mystere,"Every person involved in this show was incredibly talented and the rush of excitement within me kept flowing throughout the 90 minute show.

Before the show started, the show starts! You will see performers interact and mess with the audience to keep those waiting, entertained. Definitely a great start to the show and I had my fair share of good laughs.

During the show, there is some kind of magic that flows throughout the whole building and stage. You can see how much effort these people put into this show. Every little detail is noted and it is almost impossible to see everything at once because there is so much going on. Everything happens in every direction and it just gives you a rush of excitement throughout the whole show. The performers were extremely talented in their acrobatics, stunts, and acting. The crowd interaction and improvisation were amazing!

After the show, it will come to a realization that the amount of effort they put into making this wonderful performance is tremendous. You definitely cannot forget about the music! They play live music throughout the show which makes the performance twice as good. I definitely feel that the band should be more appreciated.

If you come here, definitely expect for it to meet your expectations and higher!"
Mystere,Saw Mystere several times over the years.  Went back for the first time in about 12 years and it was just as awesome as I remembered it.  They tweaked some of the acts for the better.  Go back and see it again.
Mystere,"It was my first time to watch a Cirque du Soleil show. I came with my family and was so excited.  The cast did not disappoint!  They were awesome!! Incredible acrobatics! Action packed, never a dull moment, definitely worth every penny for the 90min show.  There was humor, intensity, and spectacular moments.   They also engage with audience. A definite must see for those looking for some entertainment. Great for any age."
Mystere,"This was our first Cirque performance almost 15 years ago and nothing had compared to it since.  We loved it so much we came back for a second time and it is still our favorite.  We have seen O,and KA here in Vegas and other shows that come to Portland for comparison.
For us there is just something magical about Mystere"
Mystere,"We didnt get it, like at all...the storyline (if there was one) was very difficult to follow. It was meant to be metaphorical and symbolic, but it didnt do much for us at all.

The jokes didnt seem funny. The whole baby/papa bit at the beginning was weird and awkward.

The thing that partially redeemed this show for us was the strength and endurance portion done by the trapeze artists and acrobats. It was cool and theres no denying that.

All-in-all I wish we had gone to the Michael Jackson themed CDS show, or really anything else...we just werent happy with this choice of show and wont recommend it to friends who visit Vegas."
Mystere,"The show was good and Id say that if youre a fan of Cirque du Soleil, then its almost mandatory that you watch it. The acrobatics were flashy and a lot of the performers were very attractive. What impressed me was that all the singing and music was played live; nothing was a recording. Another thing thats great about this show is that the theater in Treasure Island is not very big. Even though I was about 15 rows back, I was no farther than 30 yards from the stage so I could see everything clearly. 

The reason why I rated it only 3 stars is because of one very big con. One of the characters in the show is an obese middle-aged man who is supposed to be a baby. He wears an oversized diaper and an undersized t-shirt while sucking on a pacifier. He uses baby talk and prances around as if hes a toddler. There are several times in the show when he is alone on stage as a solo act. While some people in the audience thought he was funny, I thought his antics were super annoying. If they removed him from the show, I wouldve rated it 5 stars."
Mystere,"This was my husbands and my first Cirque show and we loved it! The aerial acrobatics and strength of the performers left us in awe. The story line was different and shall I say, mysterious. It had some humorous parts and overall a great family friendly show. 

I would have loved to give the show 5 stars but there was a few WTF moments. There was too much audience participation that took away from the show. I assume that the performers use this time to change outfits and get ready for the next scene but at times it was a little uncomfortable."
Mystere,"I really liked Mystere for the most part. I thought it was a good value for what we got to see. Some of the other Cirque shows like O are pretty expensive and I think its worth your time seeing Mystere if you havent seen it already or if you want a cheaper alternative. I really liked all the acrobatics, music, theatrics, and artistry of the show. The theater is small and nice and cozy. 

PRO-TIP: I think the seats in the top zone are actually better than the ones near the bottom. A lot of the activity is elevated, so if you are sitting in the top you can pretty much just look straight or tilt your head up a little bit. We opted for the seats near the top for a cheaper price and I had no regrets. We bought the tickets online for about 70 dollars each. I was able to print them out, so that was pretty convenient. 

We saw the show on a Saturday night and it was extremely busy. I RECOMMEND taking a TAXI there. We thought it would be a piece of cake to valet the car at Treasure Island, but they didnt have any more Valet parking to offer when we got there. My fiancé ended up being a bit late to the show because he had to self-park the car and there was TONS of traffic. 

The only cons I have is that I didnt really like the filler parts with the baby in it or comedy/magic with audience parts. I get bored with this type of comedy and sarcasm easily. I guess all shows are going to have filler, but I just really wanted to see the real action and acrobats. 

Overall, I think this show is great first show to see in Vegas and is a good bang for your buck."
Mystere,"First time in Vegas and of course Cirque was a must-do. Mystère was amazing; the acts, the stage, the atmosphere. There is definitely a lot going on, so would probably need to come back to get a different perspective, but definitely would recommend to anyone who enjoys Cirque performances."
Mystere,"Nice show.  Tip: there is a long line for the show.  Come toward the actual show time.  If you arrive early, you will just have to stand in an amazingly long line."
Mystere,"Absolutely amazing. The 90 minute show is a treat to watch. Recherché performance by the troupe, fantastic sound and light effects and a hi-tech stage is a combination that keep the audience immersed into the show.
Jaw-dropping acrobats and stunning performance with mix of funny acts keeps you at the edge for the whole duration.
A definite definite must see while you are in Vegas. A unique experience.

Tip: Very busy show, saw long lines for tickets (and even entry) so should buy tickets well in advance, choose good seats and be there well in time."
Mystere,"Amazing show, this was the first Cirque performance Ive seen and now I want to see all of them. There is a warm-up act with a clown who is actually pretty funny. He also comes out in between some of the acts, which range from Japanese style taiko drumming to trapeze artists. The staging and costumes are all amazing. 

We got discounted tickets at a tix for tonight booth and had to come to the theater to pick out our seats. In all the combined wait was probably close to an hour but the show was worth it. Our tickets were $68 and the ushers were kind enough to reseat us closer when we arrived. If Im back in Vegas I would definitely see this show again!"
Mystere,"When I last left Cirque du Soleil and an early rendition of Mystère it was 1990 in Santa Monica California and only one show existed. I was covering the event and some backstage hijinx for a piece David Sheehan would run on KNBC News. Flip ahead 26 years. I got to sit down and enjoy the show as a spectator while visiting Las Vegas and was thrilled. 
The show starts off with a funny guy in a suit escorting people supposedly to their seats but instead takes them all over the theater to every place besides where they are supposed to be and it builds from there. No more clown in a grey suit and a derby on a bike. This show has an all new theme. The man in the tuxedo weaves his way in and out of acts making things funny and keeping the show cohesive. Think of him as the string that keeps many beautiful beads (the acts) all in line and flowing. But wait, there is more. Beautiful color and music abounds. There are people jumping and flying around almost weightless in beautiful choreographed aerial stunts. The most impressive act was two gents who used brute strength and geometry to work gravity of two human bodies and move themselves in ways that cannot be described here in written word. From a comical perspective, audience participation was great. You will rediscover the word PAPA and find yourself saying it over and over and laughing after the lights come up and leave the venue. 
I thought this show was a hit when I first saw it in 1990. This visit reaffirmed my initial feelings. The bonus was I got to take my wife who is a farm girl from Thailand. To see her face light up and hear her oou and aah is well worth the admission price. This is a MUST SEE!!! Kids will love it too and you will find yourself wanting to see other shows. I give it 2 thumbs Up!!"
Mystere,I wanted to catch a show before I left back to my home town. I had my daughter with me to so I wanted to watch something that Ill enjoy as well as my daughter . So we ended up picking this show. I absolutely loved it I fell in love with the woman singing in the back ground . They had funny parts to like the big baby and the old man I enjoyed that and my baby girl that it was pretty funny as well. It was amazing the different kind of dance and aerobics there was. Colors were beautiful. Swings were coming out the roof and I loved it . When I visit  again Im definitely gonna see other shows like this one
Mystere,"Beautiful show, but you would not expect Cirque du Soleil to have so many fails. At least 3 performers fell during the show. Maybe because it was a Sunday night and they had rookies? Still enjoyed the show, but Cirque du Soleil means perfection....and so do their ticket prices."
Mystere,"Great show! 
I was VERY disappointed in KA, so I wasnt sure what to expect with Mystere. Im not into following the story of the show, but more of being excited and interested the whole 2 hours. Even though I didnt understand the whole story, this show did not have me bored. 

Some filler parts were a bit too long, especially the scenes with the baby, but it didnt ruin the experience for me. Best seats in the house are probably top tier &amp; middle, since there are a lot of acts above the seats."
Mystere,While in Las Vegas we had a chance to catch Cirque du Soleil Mystere! Loved it! Im always excited and impressed how every show of theirs is always spectacular.
Mystere,"Mystere by Cirque Du Soleil is the longest running Cirque show in Vegas (since 1993) and its age shows, it feels tired compared to the others. There isnt a storyline, its more an exploration into the strange and unusual with slap-stick humor and antics to break up the circus acts.

The arial acrobatics are still amazing.  All props to the athleticism and showmanship of the performers, and its the cheapest Cirque ticket, so if youre not sure youll like the Cirque experience, its a more affordable way to check it out."
Mystere,"Funny, interesting, talented entertainment. Amazing acrobats. Great music. Visually well designed. Nice theater with drinks, snacks  and popcorn. 

We all enjoyed the show."
Mystere,Beautiful show...our seats were partially obstructed. Couldnt see stage well.  The seats were cheaper but they should warn you about that.
Mystere,"My 23 year old son and I saw the show last night. We thought it was boring for our age group. Seemed geared toward 7 year olds. On the teeter totter and the trapeze, they kept repeating the same tricks or close to the same. A baby came out throughout the show. The bits were juvenile.  You could barely hear or understand the MC. But his role was boring. There was not a lot of applauding or laughing which I think the performers were waiting for. Wish I knew this before buying tickets"
Mystere,"This was my first show and I must say I was just as amazed and mystified as most other reviewers. The acrobatics and showmanship were A-1 and they put a lot into the performance and stage work. They utilize the whole auditorium for your viewing pleasure and there doesnt seem like there is a bad seat in the house. It felt like the music they were playing was mostly or all live and not recorded , as you can see the band on either side working hard to keep you entertained. 
The acrobats and performers dont just feel like humans putting on a show but like strange yet flamboyant creatures putting on an elaborate performance for you.  Its like being taken into another realm,  its like  taking mushrooms or acid without getting high. As silly as it sounds its true, its just that weird, but in the best way possible. Lots of vibrant colors and elaborate sets, there is a great balance of fast pace and slower intimate moments. 
Only thing I didnt like were the human aspects like the big baby who kept ruining the show or man in the suit who kept popping up every now and again. To me it ruined the vibe and took away from the fantasy aspect and brought u back down to earth. Didnt really make me laugh either. 
I recommend this cirque du sole show if you have an open mind and like to see amazing talent. Its well worth it to get the ticket that comes with the buffet, there was a great selection of food and nothing is better than a delicious meal after a great show."
Mystere,"Ah yes, my first Vegas show.

To start, I made the assumption that people get dressed up for theatre shows. Yeah, no. Many people were bumming it, which was a bummer.

The show starts with the hilarious older man who messes with people as they come into the venue. The jokes he plays throughout the show are hilarious.

All of the acts are very different but they are damn impressive. Some swing around, some do flips. Hell, one girl does this ribbon act that makes you think shes part spider. Dont even get me started with the buff guys.

This show is a must see."
Mystere,"My boyfriend &amp; I paid 185 for this show. We had excellent seats. 202 second level where we wouldnt have to look up at the acrobatics on top of our head. Our show was at 9pm on a Saturday. Treasure island is pretty old as it is, so the theatre was pretty old as well. Honestly Vegas is amazing so we expected the show to be just as amazing but unfortunately this show was TRASH!!! The clowns did not go with the acts &amp; there was no story line!!! So boring seriously the show was just acrobatics with no story line. So there would be pauses in-between acts with random humor from clowns. Just didnt felt connected.. we ended up leaving the show &amp; going for good food to feel better about our wasted money."
Mystere,"It was a good show but i liked Ka better.  Mystere doesnt have a story line to follow.  There are no bad seats here.  Even if you are sitting in a higher up section, the theater is small so those seats have a good view.  Overall, i liked it and would recommend it but its not my favorite Cirque show in Vegas."
Mystere,"Mystère is WOW just WOW! I didnt know what to expect from this show but there are many interesting acts. And each individual performing has major talent. 

There are so many colors and acrobatic moves. There is also comedy here and there and they even get some of the audience involved. It is a very entertaining show and if you have kids they will enjoy it too. No wonder why this show is still going on after so many years. Its a definite success!"
Mystere,"Second time we have gone to see Mystere and it still as astounding as it was the first time.  The acrobats are incredible, the original music and costuming are beautiful.  I would recommend Mystere to anyone who wants to see a Cirque show."
Mystere,"I saw Mystere in 2004 and the show has changed a little, for the better.  To be fair, we probably wouldnt have bought tickets for the show, but they were included in the package we purchased for Treasure Island.  Our seats were in the back.  But Im glad we went. 

The people in the show defy logic with their unbelievable sense of balance and acrobatic feats!  I felt sorry for the people in the front row that were picked on as stage props (i.e., Babys Mama) but it was so funny and I bet they had a blast!

If you havent seen Mystere, its a great show."
Mystere,"I took my parents here on a recent visit to Vegas. I have never done drugs but I imagined this show was like being on an acid trip. It was so bizarre!!!!! Visually, it was stunning at times, and with some of the acrobatics, I was definitely amazed. 

But at many other times, I was thoroughly confused at the plot. Maybe I am not meant to understand, lol. The show was okay....I probably wouldnt see it again."
Mystere,My first show and I was in love. It was such a beautifully weird performance. Haha! The athleticism of the performers was inspiring and I have since turned the dial up on my own training to become stronger.
Mystere,Great show!  A little slow at times but there are some very talented individuals in the cast and overall the show was wonderful. The front seating was a lot more expensive and you will enjoy the this show from the cheaper seats as well. If you are down close some of the actors may include you in the act which may not be as cool as you think.
Mystere,"PROS:
-One of the cheapest Cirque de Solei shows in Las Vegas.  
-The acrobatic shows are good.  I wish they had more of them though.  About 3-4 of the scenes were pretty cool.  The trapeze scene was OK.

CONS
-Some parts of the show (such as the intermission scenes) are pretty boring. Some people in my party fell asleep during the show!  Granted we were drinking the whole day, but even our designated driver fell asleep lol
-Story is non-existent.  Its a bunch of trippy stuff happening"
Mystere,"Amazing show. Just a strange, mysterious fairy tale... and you in the middle.
Top of the line performance, perfectly performed stunts, makes you laugh , makes you cry, makes you want to stay in that amazing world longer and longer.

Totally recommended."
Mystere,This show is definitely a must do when you come to Vegas !!! So worth the money. We had forth row seats and it was amazing I was in awe of the hole thing I didnt get bored like at some other shows that Ive been to the hole time I couldnt take my eyes off of everyone in the show. They are very interactive with the crowd and you can tell they enjoy wat they do. Unfortunately someone did get hurt and they handled it so professionally but as they say the show must go on and so it did. Still I will bring family and friends to the show and recommend it to everyone that is coming to Vegas. They were amazing cant wait to see the rest of there shows !!!
Mystere,Amazing show by extremely talented performers.  The fat man baby was really weird &amp; the old man that does the crowd distracting is annoying as F.
Mystere,"In a large theatre, the performance of Mystere could be seen from any seating location. The show was beautifully costumed and choreographed. This was probably the best Cirque we have ever seen.
Leave your cameras at home and cell phones hidden away. The cell phone police frequently disturbed viewers during the performance as they harassed guests from checking their cell phone when not even taking a picture."
Mystere,"Great show! Lots of stuff going on. The upper body strength of these performers is incredible and inspiring. Great actors.

I have to say there is a lot of stuff going on at the same time so its difficult to see everything that is going on. Hard to follow the story line, wait is there actually a story line?

They made the audience laugh (and gasp!) quite a bit.

I would recommend sitting at one of the higher levels so you can see everything going on. I feel like those sitting below missed out on a lot, like people flying over the audience.

I would absolutely return and recommend."
Mystere,"This show was my first Cirque Du Soleil show about 10 years ago. So this review is way over due.

Since then I have been hooked on watching most Cirque Du Soleil shows.

This past weekend I saw O but this show and KA by far have been my favorite.

I truly never attend a show thinking of the story or plot, I just enjoy great entertainment.

Check this show out if youre in Vegas. Sign up for their fan club to get good offers.

Enjoy."
Mystere,First circ show Ive been to. Only took 8 years of living in Vegas. The intro was kind of random with this giant baby but I guess thats the point with the show. You dont know what to expect. They had some funny parts as well as some crazy acrobats. I especially like the drummers hanging from the ceiling. It was a very awesome performance. You never knew what was going to happen next. I would recommend seeing it
Mystere,My daughter and I went to see this show. We were staying at treasure island and received 40% of an adult ticket and 50% off a childs ticket. Our tickets with the discount were about 150 and we were in the section right below the very top. The theatre was actually not very big so even if your close to the top you can see pretty well. Before the show there was a guy from the show walking around that was pretty funny. Overall we had a great time.
Mystere,"Picking up tickets at will call was a disaster. If they have this show nightly, you would think that this process of picking up tickets would be streamlined. I think this started off the evening to a bad start. There was an extreme long line to pick up the tickets. I would allow ample time to pick up the tickets before the start of the show. My friends wanted to see this show in particular because they have small children under the age of 5. Apparently, according to them, this is the only Cirque du Soleil show that actually allows children under the age of 5. 

It seems as though the theme of the show is lost in translation with the various acts in this story. I read the description of what Mystere is supposed to be, but honestly, by the end of the show, I was not convinced that this was a portrayal of the mystery of life. Of course, I was impressed by the strength elements in this show, but I think that the other Cirque shows that I have seen are better than this one in particular."
Mystere,Wow I really enjoyed this show ! The acrobats were amazing ! But I do wish it had more of a story line. The story line they did have was very hard to follow and I felt like it didnt make much sense . The show was def still worth seeing tho ! Amazing !
Mystere,"It had me sitting at the edge of my seat and laughing out loud. 

There are no bad seats in the house. The theater is fairly small. Try to sit near the back in the middle. Seats are less expensive and it gives you an optimal view of the entire stage and the aerial performances. Plus you wont in the section where they mess with you. 

Call ahead because they usually have promotions. If youre a guest of Treasure Island, you can get half off!

Only gripe is because its an older show and smaller venue,  people tend to dress down. I saw flip flops and cargo shorts. I prefer to get a bit dressed up, being that its an evening show in Vegas, but thats just my opinion."
Mystere,"This is my favorite show in Las Vegas. I love the beginning. My favorite part was when they were stacking on top of each other with all of their gymnastics. 
I love the music, the costumes, the story line, and the humor is great as well. 
A+"
Mystere,"Cirque never disappoints!

We really werent planning on watching any shows on this past trip, but ended up getting last minute tickets from Tix4Tonight. Its a smaller venue than other Cirque sets, but perfect for us since we got tickets all the way at the top!

This show was cute and perfect for kids. That clown throughout the show was very funny and I loved when he pulled an audience member up and called him papa. That snail thing was creepy and cool at the same time!

Some tips (which probably applies to all Vegas shows): if youre not staying at TI, get there early because valet was crazy when we pulled up and luckily we were staying there since valet was closed for non-hotel guests.   Also, the entrance area to the theater is small and gets unbearably crowded before and after the show. Finally, make sure you eat something before the show or else be prepared to wait in long lines at all eateries in the hotel!!"
Mystere,"Some of the acts in the show were enjoyable, but the transitions from act to act were weird.  A lot of performers running on stage and doing nothing.  The trapeze acts were great, but they were up so high I was straining my neck to watch.  The clown acts went on too long and were not that funny.  I have seen O and Love twice.  I consider both of them Cirque masterpieces.  Dont waste your time on Mystere, see another Cirque show."
Mystere,"My daughters favorite show in Vegas. We had a blast, the only thing I would change it to sit back and not up front to see more of the details in the show"
Mystere,"Cool show; fairly reasonably priced, as live shows go. 

Youll get your humor; youll get your live music; youll get your audience participation. And of course, youll get the amazing, how-do-they-do-that, MAN-I-have-to-get-back-to-the-gym acrobatics and dancing. 

This was my first Cirque show, so I cant compare it to others, but I will say that it was very enjoyable, and it did leave me interested in seeing another (perhaps when theyre on tour)."
Mystere,Saw this show on our first night in Vegas and highly recommend it. Its hard to even explain as your really just need to witness their acts in person to really appreciate the strength and skill they possess to perform these acts. You wont be disappointed.
Mystere,"This is great introduction to Cirque if youve never seen one before. However, out of all the ones I have seen, it is my least favorite. 

The storyline and concept is all over the place. I found it hard to get invested in the show since there seemed to be no story to follow. The comedy was really random as well: I didnt get it, and it went on for far too long. 

The live music was great though. You can see the orchestra mounted on the sides of the stage performing the music. This was great to watch. The acrobatics were great as well. Cant complain about that. 

This is a great show to take to kids or to give yourself a cheaper introduction to Cirque du Soleil. Wouldnt go out of my way to see it again though."
Mystere,"I find that its important to see the price differences between different shows before being too constructive in my reviews. According to Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas, these are the prices that I got for 2015 (cheapest - most expensive). I want to compare these 4 shows only because they have similar whimsical approach, family-friendly and kids-friendly. 
NOTE: Keep in mind that there are ALWAYS offers at the box office and their website. You can also purchase tickets at the Half Price Show Tickets booths everywhere on the strip.

* Mystere (Treasure Island): starting at $85 for regular price (Category 3) to $119 for regular price (Category 1).

(Check out my reviews for other three shows if you are interested.)
_____________________________________________

Mystere would be my second favorite show out of all Cirque du Soleil for all ages. Looking at the price list, Mystere offers the cheapest ticket options. Thats why this show can sometimes be more popular than O show. 

Mystere consists of powerful athleticism and high-energy acrobatics, and locates exclusively at Treasure Island. They have the most beautiful and nature-y characters flying everywhere like these people have wings behind their backs. With a combination of humour, awesome music and indescribably talented acrobats, Mystere will bring you through a journey full with mystery. 

Ah one thing - dont forget to buy a drink and/or snacks to enjoy the show. If you enjoy the show, let me know whats your favorite part of it!"
Mystere,"Over the years Ive seen 4 Cirque shows.  The first one was over 15 years ago in LA under a big top tent and it was spectacular.  Then about 10 years ago I saw Zumanity in Vegas which was R rated and great for what it is, last year it was Ka at the MGM that was martial arts based and awesome but I had a hard time keeping my eyes open during the slow parts.  Then last week it was Mystere at Treasure Island - this show is what puts Cirque on the map.

Mystere is a family friendly show in a medium/ small theatre in the Treasure Island Hotel.   We splurged on the best seats and ended up in the 5th row, center.  Perfect positioning to be almost in the show.  The show starts when you sit down and there is a performer teasing people in the audience as they walk in.  He was funny and kept us laughing until the stage show started.  Then we met Big Baby a very big man dressed as a baby and from there the show went on to show some pretty entertaining and talented performers doing amazing acrobatics and stunts.  This show was fast paced, exciting and just about the quintessential Cirque du Soleil experience.  Although it is the longest running show in Vegas dont let that fool you into thinking it is outdated or not worth seeing.  I think it is by far better than Ka was.  We had the choice between seeing this or LOVE and Im so glad we choose Mystere.  I think next time we are back in Vegas we are going to bring our kids instead of seeing a different show.  This one bears repeating."
Mystere,This was an awesome show! Loved it. The performers were athletic and stayed in character the entire time. The music was awesome definitely want to see the other shows that are offered
Mystere,I loved the show. Theater is on the smaller side so every seat is a good seat. The acrobatics were amazing. Very talented people. Everyone exiting the show loved it too. Surprised it does not have 5 stars. I plan to see it again and I usually dont do that.
Mystere,"Our first Cirque show and we enjoyed it! 

Before the show even starts the entertainment begins and the audience is a part of it throughout the evening. They even got my hubby in on the action, which is usually unlike him but was hilarious. 

Theres a lot going on during Mystere. You have to stay alert and keep looking around because at any moment there could be 2-3 different acts performing on stage, something going on behind you and folks climbing the walls lol. It can be overwhelming for some and if you blink you might miss something, but we really enjoyed the show and are glad we chose it as our first. 

We stayed at Treasure Island so were able to get great seats buy one get one free. We also noticed they have deals at Tix4tonight booths."
Mystere,"We were seated towards the center back, but even those felt like very good seats to view the show. The show was very entertaining: funny at moments, exciting during the acrobatic scenes, and included some comedic front row audience interaction. My reason for a minus-one star is that I felt there was too many different things going on throughout the production, whereas I like one coherent storyline, like there is in Ka. While I thoroughly enjoyed each of the different parts, it felt like a random mixture of acrobatics for me. Yes, I did notice the reprise of the baby and the snail throughout the show, but it felt like they came in at random points."
Mystere,"2 very different feelings after the show: 
1. The acrobatics were amazing, stunning visuals,interesting/ psychedelic characters!

2. The old man clown that was in most of the show was terrorizing the theater by throwing popcorn and champagne at random people in the audience.
Made me very upset and uncomfortable. I am not here to get attacked! Who is going to pay for my dry cleaning? Not to mention its entirely disrespectful.
Also, the giant baby character and his poopy humor was also throughout the performance. It was weird and creepy to say the least. I understand you need light humor for the children in the audience, but couldnt we stick to clean, cool magic tricks or literally anything else besides a giant fat man in a pamper running around the audience?  Wouldnt see it again, but cool acrobatics!"
Mystere,"I really enjoyed Mystère. The tickets are pretty pricey no matter where you purchase them through, but we did get great seats (3rd row, close to center), so the view of the stage and performers was fantastic. The music is lovely, and I love that it is all live - instruments and singing. The adult/baby act is kind of strange, and feels like it doesnt fit, but I watched the show thinking this whole thing was from their perspective and that helped me feel less weird. It was cool that they interact with people in the audience, the comedic part of the show is great and entertaining. The acrobatics are phenomenal. I wanted to see O but they werent doing shows the weekend I was in town, and this show got the highest reviews. I really appreciated how quickly they get you in and out, too. When we arrived before the door opened, the line stretched through the whole casino practically, but once they opened the doors, we were in and seated in a breeze."
Mystere,"We got our tickets the day of at a half tix off place on the strip and then we went to the box office to choose our seats &amp; get our tickets. Try to get seats further away instead of very close to the stage. 
The acts were fabulous, and it was amazing to see how much the stage could be manipulated. The show was very interactive with the audience and there were elements of comedy to the show."
Mystere,"My least favorite Cirque show to date. I was really looking forward to seeing one live in Vegas, where the stages are custom built just for their shows, after seeing four in San Francisco and two through Netflix videos.

Honestly, the rigging and design for the traveling shows must be flawless, because I didnt notice any improvement seeing this show in Vegas.

It was mesmerizing like all Cirque shows, for sure, but it was too short and had too much stupid filler with the adult baby that is just embarrassing and not funny.

Also, no German Wheel.

The worst, though, was the ushers, who were super-distracting. Our seats were right on the edge of a section, so right next to an aisle where two ushers stood--and moved around and TALKED (trying to get roving people back to their seats)--the whole time. Very distracting, after spending almost $200 on 2 tickets. They could try to move less, speak more softly, and make themselves less visible/audible."
Mystere,"Student ID card gets you a big discount (35% I think) for up to 4 tickets when u call in to box office.

Id rate it pretty low on the scale of vegas cirque shows.... but it costs a lot less.  So maybe start here?

The other reviews are correct... the acrobatics are amazing, but the comedy is so weird."
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show - definitely not my last! I watched O after this and I want to say that the two were on par and both amazing in different ways. Whereas certain acts in O felt a little scattered and at times there felt like there was too much going on, Mystere really draws you in and focuses your attention. The fact that the acrobatics were done over a solid stage as opposed to a pool heightens the sense of danger and makes it a more exciting show to watch.

For almost the entire duration of the show, I was on the edge of my seat in a good way, in awe of the performers and the surreal atmosphere that is Mystere - the costumes, backgrounds, lighting, music and impressive acrobatics all work well together to immerse the viewer in a different reality. I loved the giant snail and was impressed how they managed to get it onto the stage. I could have done without the clown acts but I understood that theyre a necessary evil to entertain the audience during transitions between acts.

Worth the money! It cost me a little over $100 to sit in one of the first few rows and Id say it was a fair price to pay to be filled with a childlike sense of wonder."
Mystere,"I attended this show last night with my fiancé.  Having been to both good (ka) and bad(believe) cirque du soleil shows before,  I was hoping that this would be a good one.  I was not let down as this one was a very entertaining one featuring a bunch of different acts built into the show like the pole climbers, trapeze artists, strong men and others.  What was unique about this one that i hadnt seen in a cirque du soleil show before was the short comedy skits.  Some of it worked for me like the crazy Albert Einstein dude creating some mischief with the audience while the other but with the baby bird did not.  Oh well, to each their own.  I also thought that the whole thing with the snail was weird (it growing up throughout the show?) but perhaps i missed something.

The bottom line for me is that I would recommend this show for anyone coming to Vegas.  The acts were all great and they really did a good job of using the lighting and theater to enhance it."
Mystere,"This is Cirque du Soleils original act and it was great! There were moments we would just look in wonder in sheer admiration and wonder of some of the performers strength and skill. Some acts of pure strength and skill, and some of beauty and grace. I had never seen Mystere until now and really liked it. Weve seen Ovo, their travelling show and Iris at the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles too which is great.

We cant wait to come back to Las Vegas to see Ka, Zarkana, and possibly Zumanity. 

We did see one guy very very angry after the show for getting showered in popcorn during the pre-performance act. Im not sure why he and his date stayed through the whole thing if they were that pissed off about it from the beginning and instead waited until the end to say something, they should read the reviews before going in knowing what they will be in for haha. Due your own diligence."
Mystere,"I have always loved Cirque De Soleil venues so this performance was no exception.. I am always mesmerized by the stunts that are performed, the elaborate outfits, and the musical selections for each act.  JUST FABULOUS AND WORTH SEEING!!"
Mystere,This show was my favorite!! It is so amazing how they preformed... it had tons of action &amp; comedy! Since they use the whole stage.. there really isnt a bad seat anywhere and it lasted an hr and a half. Well worth the money for tickets. This is a MUST SEE show in Vegas!!
Mystere,"AMAZING! My absolute favorite cirque show! 

As a trapeze artist myself, I loved the trapeze act but all of the acts were incredible. This is my second time seeing the show and I would definitely go again. 

It was nice that there wasnt any filler stuff, like juggling, just one great act after the next!"
Mystere,"I had been wanting to go to a Cirque de Soleil type of entertainment since we were in Las Vegas and we decided to go to Mystere. I know there are other shows but we figured we would take the monorail from the MGM Grand and check this out. It is located in the Treasure Island Hotel, the line to get in was long but it went by fast.  The girlfriend found some online tickets which were less than the $125.00 box office price so we saved some money there.

The performances are floor to ceiling, so expect to look up and down to see the performers act on the floor and  mid-air. The seats were comfortable and they all gave good viewing of the show. I like the visuals on the multi-platform stage with the two surrounding pillars that looked like rock climbing mountain. Each side pillar encased musicians and singers. Musical theme is sorta European techno with a violins, synthesizers and guitars.  The main drummer was all alone with his ensemble of drums, symbols, congos &amp; timabales. 

The acts were mostly of dancing and acrobats. They had trampoline, trapeze, see- saw and floor exercise routines.  All performers had colorful costumes. I told my girlfriend that this is the place where all of the former UCLA gymnasts end up at. My favorite act was the trapezes with multiple performers doing multiple flips and catching each other. On some acts, there were floor drummers playing large drums and dancers performing to the music. Lots of pounding of drums...

I think the show was truly entertaining and definitely worth the money.  Bring the family, fun for all ages."
Mystere,"I seriously cant believe the stuff these guys did. We sat up front and in the middle and by far the best place to sit. Acrobatics were of course mind blowing, but the live music, the vocals, the choreography and even the comedy made this a night to remember. The visuals were like no other. My first CDS experience, def not the last."
Mystere,"My first Circus de Soleil show that Ive watched! I didnt know what to expect except.. it has to be good!

I have to admit.. I was kind of confused at the whole thing but I didnt care because the show was very very entertaining. This lady playing a role of a kid was looking for a papa and she picked a man at the audience - I thought it was pretty funny on how she called him papa in a kiddish voice. Although I didnt understand the whole story concept of the show... I was very mesmerized by the lead singer - she was on top of the stage to the side. I was sooooo impressed by her voice - she could be in the lord of the rings or mythical movie or show there is and be a fairy or some sorceress! She was REALLLLY good! 

The whole experience was fantastic! Im looking forward to watching other Circus de Soleil show in Las Vegas."
Mystere,"Mystere is just classic Cirque in my book. And probably the most family-friendly too. Though, there are certainly some adult moments that will probably go over kids heads. The theatre is small enough that every seat is pretty much a good seat. Theres always so much to look at and see. Its a pretty immersive experience. And theres some audience interaction too. Its probably the most like a circus, but still all Cirque-like. I cant say I could follow the story line, but I did definitely enjoy myself. Lots of funny moments (the clown part is great) and some great theatrics. And good deals on tickets arent too hard to come by. All in all, this is a solid show that is sure to entertain your entire group. Safe and entertaining for kids and parents alike."
Mystere,"I come to Vegas a lot for work and I always wanted to see a Cirque du Soleil.  Well let me take that back, I always wanted to see a good one, since our only other experience was the Chriss Angel one (WASTE).

The first thing that happened when we walk in was an usher upgraded our seats, we thought that was pretty cool.  The clown guy that was in the first part of the show during seating was actually pretty funny, not your American type clown with all the make up this was a classy clown!

The show was amazing, very nice tricks and the music was awesome.  My only beef was the fat baby and some gal in pajamas, I still dont have a clue what that had to do with the show, but maybe I missed something.  

Next time I want to try O, but was not disappointed that I saw this one first."
Mystere,"Incredible, magnificent, and unforgettable!!! My boyfriend and I went to see this show this past Tuesday and we both loved it! They constantly interact with the public and all the performances are breathing taking! I would totally recommend it!!!"
Mystere,"My wife and I loved the show, there were lots of cool precision acrobatic scenes.  It was their last show for a few weeks.  We got a giant yard filled with bacardi 151 and stood in line for 15 minutes to get tickets at Tix4Tonight.  They do not give you a seat number at the booth, once you get to the theater at Treasure Island then they will give you a seat.  The tickets are about 40-45% off of face value.

I do not think there are any bad seats in there.  It is pretty small, we sat on the side and thought the seats were great.  During the show we got up and moved to another seat where we had a whole section practically to ourselves.  

We both would recommend it to someone else."
Mystere,"One of the original Cirque shows in Vegas.. and one of the better ones. You dont need to line up unless you really want to because, cmon, youve got assigned seats. There will be the usual Cirque performer thatll be causing some trouble in the theater so you should probably come in about 10-15 minutes before the show for that. Hes fun!

There are many different acts/scenes as it moves from one stage to the other and theyre all very good. I loved almost all of them and thats usually saying a lot. The baby character is always a nice comedic relief. They do a lot more audience participation in this one and thats always a plus. Love seeing peoples reactions and Im sort of surprised they get away with some stuff, haha.

KA is my favorite but this is definitely my 2nd :). MUST SEE!"
Mystere,"Id seen cirque du soleils advertisements for shows for quite a while before I decided to actually attend one, and I was genuinely entertained the entire time. 

As far as acrobatics go, Id seen more impressive acts in other areas of the globe, but the theatrical quality and costumes were superior. 

Definitely a good experience and worth seeing!"
Mystere,"My least favorite Cirque show out of O and Zumanity.  In fact, I left early.  It starts slow and boring with a French puppet.  The part that really made me hate the show was the big fat baby . . .none of it was funny . . .it was gross.  Like the grown men dressing as babies fetish.  I know this was the original and trust me . . .theyve come so far from this . . ."
Mystere,"My 1st Cirque show and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the show. Time flew. My moment of annoyance was the realization that so many amazing things were happening I might miss something. Some talented,  powerful, captivating people. And you laugh. Worth every penny."
Mystere,"Classic cirque de soleil. Worth viewing at least once if you are new to the series. Great introduction show. If you are looking to watch only one cirque de soleil type of show, skip this show. Instead go watch Le Reve at Wynn. Le Reve costs more to see but worth the added cost."
Mystere,"This was my first Vegas show and it was pretty good. Although, some parts were a bit...creepy. Before the show started and everyone was still finding their seats, on the stage were these two blood-red glowing neon baby carriages that were making really annoying baby sounds. It was like being stuck on an airplane and the baby wont stop making noise and the parents dont even care. After the show started they were removed.

The comedian/magician that looked like the Mad Hatter was entertaining. He periodically messed with the audience and screwed with the people on stage but only when the crew was setting up for the next part of the show. There was also this ventriloquist with a big puppet who did a few acts but he was in the show so the puppet was only used as a distraction like the Mad Hatter guy while the crew set up.

After the show started, this big guy in a baby costume came on stage and did some obnoxious baby imitation. He was bouncing a ball, falling off the stage, and acting like a doofus. He even got this lady sitting in the front row to help him out and through the entire show, when he was on stage he kept calling her mama and requested her assistance with his acts. The woman obviously didnt want to play along but he wouldnt take no for an answer (and neither would most of the audience). 

The show had a lot of different parts and sometimes it was hard to keep track of what was going on because people would be coming in from the sides, the ceiling, the floor, and wherever else they had entrances. At one point, costumed people where standing in the aisles of the theater but they didnt appear to be doing anything before they left. Maybe they were giving signals to the stage performers. There was also a band on one of the upper decks but I dont think they were actually playing the instruments because I saw them stop several times and the music was still playing. 

The Taiko drum session was probably my favorite part. My next favorite was the two guys doing a balancing routine. The rest was ok. High flying acrobats, trampoline performers, see-saw jumping, many flips and twirls from just about everybody, odd costumed characters, a big weird snail float, and a rooster-man who was in practically every part."
Mystere,"This was my first and only Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen in person. Ive always been mesmerized by the videos Ive seen (old shows that no longer run are sold on DVD online). The performers are sensational dancers and athletes. They are fearless, agile, strong, flexible, and have star-quality. It must be insanely difficult to execute those moves especially in unison to a choreographed show. My sister and I researched shows before visiting and this was the one we could agree on. I believe it is the longest running Cirque show in Vegas? Forget the Half Price Ticket Kiosks on the streets; I woke up early and was one of the first in line and they didnt offer me a very good deal. I went back to my hotel room and ordered tickets online for a better deal. We ended up sitting in the 2nd row, but on the side of the stage. The price was good and we might have missed some things...but who wouldnt? Theres so much going on. We were so close to the performers and nothing obstructed our view. Im not sure I understand the theme, its eccentric performance art. I understand the skits between acrobatics is in order to give the performers a chance to rest and change. I appreciated the funny old man, but I was disturbed by the giant baby. Get there early, because the concession stand was one of the slowest Ive experienced. Get their extra early if you have to pick up will-call tickets. The line for Mystere was long and winding through casino, but once the doors opened it moved pretty quickly until concessions. They do have some wine and beer options. Caution, sit up close and you might end up as part of the show."
Mystere,"I think I enjoyed this show particularly because the tickets I got were SO GOOD. We literally sat in the third row or second row from the front and dead center of the stage. Although it is a round stage, the spot we had in the middle was perfect to catch all the action.

Having seen many different Cirque du Soleil shows, I was also not expecting much and figured since I got the tickets on the cheap that it wouldnt be too good anyway. I was totally wrong. The show was extremely entertaining and the story line was actually quite a lot of fun. I highly recommend this, as it is also family friendly unlike some of the other Vegas shows.

I thought this show was very solid and a great spend, especially with such good seats!"
Mystere,"I have seen a lot of cirque shows and this by far has been the worst, there is no storyline. I was literally falling asleep in my seat...when in Vegas you need a show that will keep you awake and entertained. By far best shows I have seen are Ka and O...and my all time favorite Love."
Mystere,"Ive been dying  to see a Cirque du Soleil  since everyones been raving about them from forever ago but I have to say this was a little disappointing tonight. I excepted a little more from them since they were soo hyped up. 

There were a lot of acts in there that I thought were super random and I really didnt get the point of them. Some of acts I felt like were really big wastes of time. I really wanted to see mind blowing acrobatic moves and there were only a handful of those throughout the whole 90min show. 

I thought this was a nice show for kids since there was a pretty large segment with a women pretending to be a baby.  A lot of kids really seemed to enjoy the baby act. 

I felt like a lot of their acts were pretty typical. They LOOKED more amazing than it really was because each act was sprinkled with all these random people in beautiful costumes prancing around distracting you from realizing that the acrobatic act on display really wasnt that amazing. 

I really did enjoy the act with all the poles and people climbing up the poles so effortlessly. That was pretty amazing. But everything else wasnt that mind blowing. In fact, the show that I watched had not ONE but TWO mistakes. One of the mistakes was during the act where people get launched off a seesaw from both ends. The second mistake was during one of my favorite acrobatic acts, where they swing in midair, do flips, and catch each other in midair while completing all their flips and timing everything perfectly. 

I dont know if its because I waited so long to see a cirque du soleil show and therefore I raised my expectations higher than they could ever reach, or maybe it just wasnt their night (since they did mess up TWICE). Whatever it was, I wasnt impressed, since I did have to pay over $100 to watch them. 

I think Im gonna give cirque du soleil one more chance in the future. But if I watch another one of their shows and I still dont enjoy it, I think Im gonna have to just write them off and stop wasting money on them."
Mystere,"Mystere was my first live Cirque Du Soleil show a few years ago.  I had 3rd row seats which was perfect,  

Like most CdS shows, Mystere has several things happening on the stage at once but theres usually one focus item with acrobats, dancers, acts of strength and endurance but in the back you may see characters watching the act themselves or a clown crossing the stage.

CdS shows are worth the money you pay for them.  The prices are high because there are many performers and details that come with the show.  If you cant make Vegas, please try to check out one of the traveling shows.  They are just as good."
Mystere,"Im not a big fan of Las Vegas. I dont like to gamble and the whole Nevada sprawl and crowd thing doesnt inspire my travel exploration desires. However, a Training Class was conveniently scheduled here, and its only a short and inexpensive flight from Oakland. I also like Cirque du Soleil shows and when I was here, Sin City offered the following choices:

- O at the Bellagio
- Zumanity at New York York
- KÀ at MGM Grand
- Love at The Mirage
- Chris Angel Believe at Luxor
- Viva Elvis at Aria
- Mystère at Treasure Island

I chose Mystère because the discounted ticket price was right and the show offered the right combination of theme and show time.  O or Love seem to be the most popular (and expensive), but I was happy to settle into the Theater at Treasure Island and thoroughly enjoy the show. Everything hit the right notes for me, whether it was the Adult Baby or Usher Clowns (including audience participation), the vocals, the dual muscular poses, the high altitude acrobatics, or a bunch of stuff in-between. I have also been to enough Cirque shows that lack of story line coherence is entirely beside the point. Particularly interesting is that Mystère has been here for 18+ years and still feels fresh. 

After the Show, I wandered into the Boutique and overheard one couple mentioning that they liked O better. Maybe Id agree, if I had the time to see more Cirque Shows during my stay (KÀ or Viva Elvis might have been next). But I didnt care. I had a great time, and for the moment, no comparisons were necessary or welcome."
Mystere,"Ive seen O, Ka and Mystere and I would say amongst the 3 of them, Mystere has the most floor acrobatics. Shoutout to the red bird performer who is always so amazing!! The whole cast make it look so easy but really they are crazy difficult acrobatic moves! 

Definitely come early to see the preshow with the clown. Really funny audience interactions and didnt know time flew. 

I love the stage, lights and the live music! I absolutely love the soundtracks of Mystere and O! 

I feel like for any Cirque show dont get the front row seats. Getting in the middle section will give you the whole picture because there will be performers above, center and to the side stages."
Mystere,"Very cool to see! The theater is set so that theres pretty much no bad spots in the place. If you sit in the lower seats, you feel much more involved in the show however. The performers are incredible, and the lights, music, and props are prime. Beware if you sit lower level and are shy, they do pick on members of the audience! Definitely worth the money."
Mystere,"Mystere was my very first Cirque du Soleil show and it remained as one of my all time favorites. It was such an energized performance full of stunning visuals, great music and exciting tricks. 

Even though Mystere is the oldest Cirque du Soleil residence show in Vegas, it is still not shy in comparison to newer productions. There were a lot of tun elements, both classic and modern. The acts were loosely held together by a coherent theme but there wasnt any strong story line. It was like going to a party. You have to live in the moment."
Mystere,"I watching today its show and its really really something amazing in its world...I love circus de soleil..they make delicious show its world,BRAVO...."
Mystere,"Spectacular! The acrobats, dancers, musicians etc are amazing! interesting costumes. If you are in town to see some shows, dont miss this one."
Mystere,"The acrobatic part of the show is incredible. I liked it more than the Beatles and Michael Jackson Cirque. I didnt like the filler nearly as much though. In fact, I disliked it."
Mystere,I enjoyed this show and it was impressive.  I would recommend it to anyone I know.  I was amazed by the flying around.... just amazing to watch.  The theatre is pretty big and the stage is big.
Mystere,"Absolutely amazing show. Colorful, beautiful, mystifying and rhythmic. This is by far one of the best shows in Vegas hands down. The performers were excellent and there was even a little bit of comedy. I would definitely see this show again when I visit."
Mystere,"Simply wonderful! Blew my mind. 

We came with a group of trapeze artists and having swung on the trapeze earlier in the day, it doubly reminded us of how talented these performers are. Amazing.

Its hard to to pinpoint what I liked best. I enjoyed it all! I would love to see it again as there is so much that is missed. Your eyes dart here and there and cant take it all in.

Highly recommend."
Mystere,"The show was Amazing!!!! Very colorful and graceful performance. Barring a few mistakes, the show was flawless. The artists failed to pull off some really really tough stunts, however, the attempt was admirable. We got free upgrades to the front section which had stunning views of the performance. Last but not the least, the show had a great sense of humor embedded between the performances."
Mystere,"Hysterical the scam they pull on you...
Got a coupon buy one get one and they advertise 49.50/ per person available?  One rep says no that is fall rate?  Ok idiot it is fall....November and you have it plastered everywhere....so if you use human math 49.59 .4/2 would be about 100 plus tax.  Well when you use mobster math somehow it comes out to be 386.59?   Am I getting private show? 
No we were told feed and taxes?  WTF?
Rip off and just another way treasure island rips you off.  No way we were going to pay that price.  It should be illegal to do this crap.  I just want to see a show but another fuzzy math incident.  Dont waste $$$$"
Mystere,"This show is great!! I truly love every cirque show. Everything these artist do is amazing and takes discipline. So dont knock it because one person slips here and there. Ive read some negative comments about the show and im sure these people cant do what these artist can with one finger. Its funny exciting mysterious...its art ..youll enjoy it..especially if you have an appreciation for music..dance..acrobatics..etc. I have alot of respect for all these performers and so should you. This was my second time seeing it and I had a better experience this time because i got good seats..last time i was in the corner and didnt have a goid view. My family loved it, this was the first time they had seen anything like this..Plus this show hss been going on for many years..so they must be doing something right.."
Mystere,"this was a great show, Although do NOT watch cirque du soleil wolds apart on netfilx first or you will see 2/3 of the show. I made that mistake so I knew what was going to happen, but to see it in person was a totally different thing. Also front row seats are not the best seats, try to sit 3-4 rows back. I sat in the front row and it was cool to have some of the performers walk right up to you and to see their facial expressions but the view could get obstructed at times and  some aerial things were just hard to see being so close...I was more looking up than forward sometimes. 

Finally nobody explains this but there is a fake usher that roams around and throws popcorn and or water on you. If you get shown to your seat and a bright spotlight is on you, sh*ts about to go down..."
Mystere,"This show is the worst in the Cirque lineup in my opinion. I enjoy the work acrobats do and respect in greatly, and Im always amazed by the concepts and ideas of the shows. Mystere kept me thinking for a while....biggest thought was - what were the creators smoking? ?? Seriously, some moments,  including the ending, had me puzzled as they made no sense, and things looked weird. Its not much cheaper than any other Cirque show, so I recommend watching another one instead."
Mystere,"The show was ok, entertaining. One unfortunate thing was a loud young drunkard right behind me.  Was making loud comments every time something new came up.  A real asshole.  I looked at him until we had eye contact which kind of slowed his antics but he started up again a few minutes later. I complained about him to one of the huskers and he said said ok ill be quiet
but as soon as she left he started up again. It was near the end of the show so we decided to leave and i called him an ass and we left and he just laughed. I would have punched him but he was a pretty large young man and Im in my 50s. He would have killed me. 
so it was not the best of evenings , i really have lost my allure for vegas. I dont remember seeing so many young loud out of control youngsters. I also noticed as crossing the overhead bridges that connected the casino were many scary looking characters just loitering around checking out people that walked by.  I couldnt believe that security was not patrolling that area to keep it safe. 
I use to love vegas, the gambling, the shows , the atmosphere. It has changed so much. Not the vegas i remember."
Mystere,"Prepare to be amazed ! Its all very high energy, cute AND funny! We were in the center third row but I think the grandeur of the show can be felt from any seat! Appropriate for all ages."
Mystere,My second time seeing this show. It was as amazing as I remembered. I could see it 10 times and notice something new each time. The audience participation is always fun. The acrobats are awesome!! Highly recommend!!
Mystere,"I really liked this show. There was a little bit of everything. Good drums, great acrobatics, a pretty good story and some amazing aerial feats. I was very happy with this as my first real Cirque Show (saw Chris Angel, but thats more magician than Cirque, still good though). 

The performers were all over the place,even running through the crowd. I was very glad my girlfriend decided to take me to this show. 

The trapeze artists were the only thing that didnt quite fit, but overall, Id watch this again. For a fun night, give this show a chance."
Mystere,"One of the first Cirque shows I have seen, and it is still a treat even to this day. Since I travel to Vegas on biz a few times a year I try to drop in on a Cirque show when I am there and have seen this one a few times. Since it is a long running show located at Treasure Island casino tickets are usually available, and not as costly as some of the others.

The stage setup is pretty different as it is shaped like the letter U and the seats come right up to the stage, or so it seems. Views from most seats are good. When going to your seats there are clowns that perform throughout the audience before the show so be careful - you might get popcorn or water splashed on you!

This Cirque show features (as always) amazing acrobats, great music, fun clowns, feats of strenth and balance, and moments that will have you on the edge of your seat with your jaw dropping. The two brothers performing feats of strength and balance are awe inspiring. All of the performers are amazing, the stage sets are like a psychedelic forest, and the costumes are super colorful. Just visually stunning.

Definitely a great show to see if its your first Cirque show. Sit down with an open mind, watch out for the clowns, and be a bit freaked out by the giant fat baby!"
Mystere,"My husband and I have never been to a Cirque du Soleil show, I have heard that they are incredible- and it absolutely was. We were literally laughing, smiling and in complete awe all through the show. Such fantastic performances from all involved. Absolutely a must-see!!!"
Mystere,"Ive seen other cirque du soleil shows and this was probably my least favorite. While I still enjoyed it, there were parts that seem weird and confusing. 
Usually the show has theme and storyline to it, but this one was pretty random. Maybe thats what makes it a mystery?? 
The acrobats and individual acts were impressive, but based on the previous shows (kooza and totem) I had higher expectations"
Mystere,"I would highly recommend being drunk after a nice dinner before coming here, as it definitely helps the trippiness of the visuals and the giddiness of the vibe sit better if one doesnt think or try to overanalyze it much. The usher between acts was definitely a highlight of the show, getting people riled up and being a master of physical slapstick. Some of the acrobatic segments were far more predictable, so while it was no less stunning in the performers athleticism, it didnt make for the same kind of comedic trippiness that the rest of the production provides. 

The best segments in my opinion are the ones with lots of props floating around and a lot of visual movement going all around and far above you at once. Sitting in the 3rd row definitely forced me to crank my head up. The set design and use of vertical platforms is nothing short of stellar. Its a little bit of a known quantity as a long-running Cirque-du-Soleil show if youve seen much of their later works, but if you havent been to one in a while or are slightly drunk, then this is a truly delightful way to spend an evening."
Mystere,"I dont really know how to even start but that it is definitely worth seeing.  The show was filled with entertainment, humor, color, art, and just plain breathtaking acts.  I would love to go in detail about everything/show but I find that it would be a spoiler.  

I will just have to say that this show will amaze you as it will prove how brilliant and talented humans are.  I highly recommend this show to you with no reservation.  

BIG WOW!"
Mystere,"From reading other reviews, youll think this is meh if you like more elaborate shows (with plots or water or whatever), but if youre into high-level acrobatics and feats with somewhat lower production values, this show is for you. O may be a bigger spectacle, but where physical stunts are concerned, Mysteres still got it beat. 

Ive seen this show probably around 10 times (in one instance we saw it around Christmas, and after returning home, felt like seeing it again so much that we returned for New Years). You might wonder why I dont get bored then of the clown routine (which is usually the same depending on how easy the audience is to pick on) or any of the acts. 

I simply cant. It might be because its the least theatrical of the Cirques, with the premise being a very broad origins of man kind of theme. And after seeing it so many times, its almost like were in on the joke. Theres still lots to anticipate, like when a super-F.O.B. walks in and you start smirking because you knows hes easy prey. 

But it is absolute perfection of the human form. Its mind-bendingly beautiful. How anyone can get bored with the sheer athleticism onstage is beyond me. I live for the five seconds the baby girl gets on the power track and does back flips in place at warp-speed. Its the most purely-acrobatic of the shows (Zarkana being a throwback to this theme). And the music! Its probably my favorite Cirque soundtrack (the fusion-jazz-rockiest of the lot). You know what else I love? The two new acts they added replaced the two slowest acts they previously had. I love when shows or businesses know what to fix. 

Entertainment in its most concentrated form. I dont understand reviews saying its slow--its quicker paced than O or Love (I mean, O is serenely beautiful but there are some portions with unbearably long buildup with a payoff not worth the wait). Mysteres been around for over two decades now--and I hope it continues for much longer. 

*Updated: in the past few Mysteres Ive seen since the death of the Ka performer, it seems theyve truncated or cut some acts--I wonder if this is a permanent development?"
Mystere,"This is the original one among all the Cirque du Soleils. Very entertaining, colorful and a real Vegas show!!! The theater is very small, only 25 rows and we bought our tickets from half priced tickets boots , great seats :)"
Mystere,"was here on 2/15/14.

i gotta say, all of the Cirque shows are pretty amazing!
this one was NOT THE most amazing though. i couldnt really figure out the theme of the show, which ive always been able to. i dont know, maybe its just me. 
although a lot of the things they do are out of this world, it just seemed a little tired, compared to the other shows that ive seen.
im still giving it 4 stars and if you have the chance to see this, or any Cirque shows, i suggest you do it."
Mystere,"Ok so here is another from my list of top 5 shows in Vegas!

Mystere rocks! Anyone who gives this show less than 4 stars seriously needs to have their head examined in MY opinion. Perfect show for ALL ages, and family. Music is fantastic! This show gives me that euphoric feeling as if wandering through an enchanted forest! Did I mention the music? Yes but I did again. The feeling this show gives me is the feeling of what extasy may feel like. Just saying I would imagine that type of magical colorful feeling. As in a purple haze moment in time. 


Anyhow this show is a must see for all relatives and friends coming to town that you want to treat to a memorable show that they will talk about after returning home from Vegas!

Great seating as well, the venue cradles the stage like a crescent.

I have seen this show twice, once in 2007 and again in 2010 both times fantastic! Seats are comfy too."
Mystere,First experience with Cirque. Not a big fan of the circus but this really was awesome. Now I want to see all of the other shows.
Mystere,"I have seen O, One, Zarkana, Ka, Love, (Le Reve too), and many of the touring cirque shows, and I enjoyed Mystere a lot.!I would rank it just below O and Ka, but way above Zarkana. Mystere is classic Cirque du Soleil with its acrobats.

Seating: Honestly you can sit just about anywhere in the theater. The theater is on the small side, so every seat is good. I sat a few rows from the stage, and while I dont have any complaints, I would tell you to sit a few rows back and save the money. There are acts that come from high up, and at times I was not able to take it all in since I was sitting a bit close. 

Get to the theater a half hour before if you already have you tickets in hand. The line to actually get in the theater is not long. Its the line for will call that is extremely long with the people who bought tickets at the discounted ticket brokers the morning of."
Mystere,"As far as entertainment goes I am very easy to please... For the money I paid, this show  was not worth it by a long shot. It was all over the place and very difficult to follow. Between that and the creepy aspect, more often than not I found myself thinking wtf?! 
Its understandable to need an act in between acts as well for setting up... But really, whats with the annoying baby? And the old man was funny, but completely inappropriate for this type of show. These intermittent acts should relate to everything else to at least some degree. The way they did it continuously took me from somewhat interested to completely disengaged.
The performers were amazing, they get 5 stars no doubt about it. Overall I would say these performers deserve a better opportunity and this particular show should probably be retired."
Mystere,"It was hard to follow story..actually, no story
I really wanted to watch beatles love, but when we were in vegas, no show until we came back home.
Just felt wasting money..not recommended"
Mystere,"I watched the O cirque show last year and thought it was amazing..... Mystere does not pale in comparison.

There is a funny clown that interacts with the audience before the show begins and he is just hilarious. This being one of the oldest cirque show in Vegas, the tickets are totally affordable (we paid approx 70$ for Category 3 seats) we sat in section 204.
There really isnt a bad seat in this theater though because its quite small in comparison to the other Cirque theaters.

My only tip would be not to sit at the bottom bowl or so close to the stage because some of the show is performed up high over that lower bowl section and to see it youd kind of have to crane your neck up to see it.

Our view was perfect we had a visual of the WHOLE stage and could see everything and everyone that was performing throughout the entire show.

There is an aspect of humour in this show and the overall mood is light and happy."
Mystere,"Im a Cirque fan and have watched almost all the permanent shows they have in Vegas. Brought my sister (only watched Zarkana before) to Mystère with me over Christmas week. My 3rd time watching the show and I was not disappointed. 

What I love about Cirque shows is that you can watch them repeatedly without getting bored. Although youll know the general idea of a show if you watched it before, each show does minor changes and updates throughout the years so youll still get to enjoy them. 

The Mystère theatre is on a smaller scale compared to other theatres and there are no bad seats. I always get front center seats for Cirque shows but that is just my personal preference. 

This is the show I would recommend to Cirque beginners. If you are brand new to the Cirque world, this is a nice show to go to without breaking your bank. You can usually find discounted tickets and prices are cheaper compared to other Cirque shows. If you are a student or has someone in your group that has a student ID, you can usually get student discounts on all the shows, excluding holiday season when they raise prices and remove all promotionss. Youll get a nice overview of what Cirque Du Soleil shows are like and will be nicely prepared for others like O. 

I see that some people dislike the clowns and the in-between acts but that is something youll see at all Cirque shows. Clowns are a part of traditional circus and are an important element that Cirque incorporates into all their performances.

And Cirque shows are not suppose to have a clear storyline. but they do (somewhat), like the giant baby for Mystère. Google the back story for Mystère and youll see why they have the baby. Dont pay too much attention to the story or try to figure out everything. You are not suppose to. Its really all about the overall enjoyment of the show. Have some imaginations, dont read too much into the story, and you will have a great time. If you want a nice story, well then you should probably just go see a movie or something."
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show based off my brothers rave review of KA, and unfortunately a let-down. There wasnt even a pretense of a plot, a lot of the acts seemed like filler, and the comic relief wasnt that funny... mostly a lot of random dancing and jumping around. I would give them points for the muscle-men act and the see-saw act (which actually were super impressive). And the music and COSTUMES were really imaginative! 

But sorry 80% of it was confusing and if I wanted to watch people excitedly run around a stage I could get the same effect cheaper elsewhere.

Much harsher on this due to the priciness of the tickets and the exorbitantly high expectations."
Mystere,"This is my MOST FAVORITE Cirque du Soleil ever. Ive seen KA and O and while those were good, it didnt impress me like this one. 

We all come and expect great tricks done by performers because thats what these shows are about. Mystere offers that AND humor. I laughed almost throughout the whole show. I love the crazy guy that tries to help people find their seats, the baby, and the guy with the puppet. 

Every single act was so strong, precise, and powerful. The whole show was of course mysterious so it would help to have a bit of an imagination. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you ever get the chance. :)"
Mystere,"I have seen La Nouba, Love, Mystere, Zumanity, Totem and O. They all get a 5 star review if you ask me but for the record this was my favorite. This particular show is fun and has lots of audience participation especially at the beginning of the show. In the Vegas area I think Zumanity is my favorite and when it comes to the traveling shows I really liked Totem but this is definitely one to put on your list as a must see."
Mystere,Enjoyed the show. Not the best Cirque de Solis show Ive seen but still amazing. Didnt really understand the story and the giant baby portion of the show didnt really fit into the show for me....other than that the performers were top notch and amazing to watch.
Mystere,I decided to watch mystere on my last Vegas trip. I have never been to a cirque du soleis show and I was really excited to finally attend one. Not knowing what to expect this show was AMAZING! I loved every single minute of it. I know mystere is the oldest and original cirque du soleis show &amp; if your planning on watching a cirque show for the first time I recommend Mystere! You wont be disappointed.
Mystere,Amazing show! I love how so much is going on at once. No matter where you turn something is happening. So much talent on one stage from the acrobatics to the live music. There were so many great moments. This is the second Cirque show i have been to. So exciting! I recommend for everyone to see!
Mystere,"This was the second show my family (hubby and 10 and 12 year old) saw during our time in Vegas. My husband, daughter and I love Cirque shows, it was my dins first time seeing one. Loved every single second of this show! It was funny, awe-inspiring, and magical. Loved the trapeze artists, the acrobats, and the pole artists. Insanely talented athletes! Everyone in our family had a fantastic time!"
Mystere,"Very good show.  9 Year old, Wife, and I enjoyed it very much.  Was daughters first Cirque show in Vegas (Seen a couple traveling shows) and she was mesmerized.  My favs were the strong men.  Daughter loved the Albert Einstein looking guy.  Packed house and seats were pretty good.  Think we paid 64 each through TI site. Not better than Ka but definitely a very good show."
Mystere,"Two words... MIND FUKK!!!

Straight up the dopest thing Ive ever seen visually in years! I literally had to keep pinching my fiance to keep his mouth closed cause we were BOTH watching this show in awe! We loved it so much we kept standing up after every cool ass stunt to give the people a standing appluaude (which I guess is a NO NO) so they moved us to even better seat where we can stand and cheer as much as we wanted... and we did!!! This is my first Cirque show and I was NOT let down! 

And was that the baby from Knocked Up?  I am not your BABA!!

Haha.... awesome!"
Mystere,"I bought my ticket at the box office but later I learned that they had tickets at the half-off office next to Ballys. Anyways, got the cheapest section which was at the corner and it was 1/3 full. But seating is all good, we were all facing the stage. Stage goes into the crowd so everyone can see the action. Its a family show, you can enjoy with all ages. Show was very good, impressive acts. I had really good time. If you are in Vegas with family and looking for a Cirque Soleil, this one is a good one. It started with a baby scene, which did not make sense first but later I found it amusing. All other acrobatic acts were very impressive and breathtaking. Drum scene was haunting. Costumes were very well designed and colorful."
Mystere,"Our first Cirque du Soleil experience and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  I do wish the theater seats were a little wider, but its not their fault that were wide people :-)

We got discounted tickets at Tix4less, and that saved us about $20 each ticket.  The seats were good.  It looks like there are very few bad seats in the house.

We loved the show, but neither of us got the story until our hotel bellman explained it--its supposed to be a babys dream (or visions from a babys first impressions or something like that).  Now I get it..."
Mystere,"Relative to Cirques O and Dragones Le Reve this is not a five star show. That being said, this was a very visually beautiful and entertaining show in its own right. Mystere had its residence at the Treasure Island since 1993 and not a shortage of fans throughout the years, despite there being six other Cirque shows on the strip. As most of the other Cirque shows, Mystere combines a mixture of circus skills, dance, opera, music, and comedy. The awe-inspiring performance features a story that attempts to integrate human actors into a seamless whole to capture the complexity that we call life. The story itself is difficult to explain as it intertwines a magical word, exotic creatures and the world as we know it. In short, Mystere is a celebration of life.

I did not like that the theater did not have a restroom and you had to venture into the casino to use the restroom. Also, no outside alcohol allowed, but you are free to buy a cup of wine for $9!

We had amazing seats, and I was not observant enough to recognize the layout of the theater and if there really were any bad seats in the theater."
Mystere,"AH-MAZING!

This show is so fun! We sat on the side and I thought we wouldnt be able to see anything on stage but we could see everything perfectly! The show was amazing . I didnt really understand the concept of it but I think its one of those things where you have to be open minded!

The costumes are great and everyone is brilliant! Must see! :]"
Mystere,"Solid show. If you use your 2x1 discount, even better. Lasted about 1.5 hrs. You cant really have bad seating. Its not wow but you wont be disappointed. A lot of little kids/families. Overall, Youll laugh and enjoy yourself."
Mystere,"Each act meets the expected Cirque du Soleil standard of excellence. The show as a whole, however, is typical of their tent shows, i.e., if youve seen a CdS tent show, Mystere will feel a bit familiar. If youve never seen a CdS resident show in Vegas, see O and Ka first."
Mystere,"I think when I yelped this previously, I was yelping a memory of a really wonderful time in a previous life. Actually I know thats what I did. This is, unfortunately, not my favorite Cirque show. 

I frankly think it gets drawn out and...boring. It has way more comedy than athleticism and story. Athleticism still gets a 5 star rating, but the rest--kind of slow. 

The first thing that irked me is that I couldnt bring a drink in, even though it was already in plastic. We dont allow alcohol inside was what the usher said to me. I took her to mean that it was a family show and there was no alcohol inside at all. So I slammed my Jameson and went in. Ummmm theres a snack bar with booze served up 15 feet away. So they just wanted me to buy their drinks even though the drink I had purchased was from TI. Whatever. 

The next upsetting thing--no bathrooms inside the theater! What? Im sure they could have redesigned within the last 10 years to make some potties without having to leave the theater. Harumph.

Lastly, like I touched on before, its just not as exciting and fast-paced as some of the other shows. Like you dont get the real bang for your buck.

The drumming bit at the end is the coolest part IMO. There are definitely cool elements to the show, its just not my fave.

Id skip in favor of one of the water Cirque (or Cirque-type, winkity wink) shows, Zumanity, or Ka."
Mystere,This is a classic Cirque show. Not as huge as some of the newer productions but still pretty darn good. I prefer O an KA but this is still a  very entertaining show.
Mystere,"I was soooooooo disappointed with Mystere.  I have never been to a Cirque du Soleil show so I was so excited and happy to finally see one.  I got a fairly good deal with my room at TI.  Now please dont get me wrong, the acrobatics are amazing, and I thought that part of the saw was great.  The show part was just terrible.  Maybe the style of humor was just not for me but it was really, really, really bad.  The show was about this fat man dressed as a baby.  He cried and was just completely annoying the entire show.  It was not funny to me in the slightest.  If they got rid of that part of the performance it would be fine but it totally ruins the show."
Mystere,I like that show. Beautiful. Good music. Good price. Funny.  We ordered tickets online with special offer
Mystere,"Okay I really enjoyed this production.  It  is located inside Treasure Island. It was high octane for the most part. Just a word of warning be careful when the baby throws the ball because my friend caught it and became part of the show. While it was a nice experience he did miss some of the show when he was in the backstage being part of the show- lol 

I would definitely recommend this cirque production if you enjoyed La Nouba production performed in Florida! Definitely worth seeing and check for package deals. We had one that included dinner at a Treasure Island restaurant."
Mystere,"This was one of the first Cirque shows I saw after moving to Vegas and recently I returned after hearing its been revised. I remember it being different -- most notably with more props. Its still a good show with impressive performances, particularly from the two strong guys doing hand stands and more on each other; the trampoline stunts; and the trapeze act towards the end of the show. The comedic acts had its moments. It was strongest when they interacted with audience members, regardless if they were actually Cirque  employees or not. There isnt a bad seat in the theater, but it definitely looks more impressive the closer you sit. As with most other Cirque shows, discounted tickets can be had if youre a local. Parking was a nightmare. From the fifth floor of the Treasure Island parking garage it took over an hour to get out after the show."
Mystere,Unbelievable show.  The talent alone was worth the money.  And it was hilarious on top of that.  Would recommend to anyone!
Mystere,The most amazing show ever! You wont be bored with this one. Its a mix between artistic and comedy. They interact and involve the crowd. It was so much fun and so worth it!
Mystere,Best show for price of CDS tickets.  I thought this was a good one for family and younger kids to go. Very entertaining and I would go see this again.
Mystere,"Cirque du Soleil has high standards and does not miss on this show.  If you have seen other Cirque shows you will not be impressed by this one as it is the standard mix of high wire, ropes, balancing etc.  The performers are amazing and entertaining but nothing seperates this Cirque show from the pack"
Mystere,"It took me a hot second to trust Cirque du Soleil again (ref Criss Angel: http://bit.ly/1iR2g7F), but Im glad that Ive found my way back. 

Mystère was being offered at a discounted rate (make sure you ask them about it when youre calling in). We got the same rate as they were offering locals, but when we called and forgot to mention any discount, they didnt offer it to us. I think with taxes and all, it ended up being around $70 for Category C tickets. We bought them a few hours before the show, so when I asked if they were the best available seats, he mentioned they were the ONLY available seats that had 3 together. Fortunately, they were center seats, so we were able to get a pretty good view of what was going on.

As for the storyline, I flat out didnt get it. However, despite it not being very straightforward, I found the show to be comical and entertaining. The athleticism that goes into the talent that work for the show is crazy impressive. During the trapeze act (spoiler alert!), one of the performers fell (into the net below), which goes to show that this show is not something that will be perfect each time, but the performers just get right back up and continue where they left off. The show itself also has live music and singer that you can see on either side of the stage.  

All in all, I would say this is similar to Zarkana in that it just seems like a bunch of acts put together, but was nevertheless pretty impressive."
Mystere,"The show stage was amazing on how everything was changing. The best view is probably the first 2 few rows in the middle section B. If you take seat very close to stage you may end up straining your necks a little to see the full picture. 
This is my third shows after KA and O and I think I had high expectations so was slightly disappointed. I didnt like some baby themed comedy and felt it was bit of drag."
Mystere,"Great show.  Small piece of advice: people start lining up well before :30 before the doors open- the line to get in is ridiculously long.  Once the doors open, it moves pretty fast.  Dont worry when you get there at the time that doors are supposed to open, and you see a seemingly neverending line which goes into the casino.  The line moves in pretty fast.

1. Dont buy popcorn unless you are prepared to have it completely dumped on top of you.

2. Dont pick up any large balls which float your way if youre in the front rows at all.  Unless you want to be a part of the show."
Mystere,"Costumes and music are amazing; the drums sequences are haunting. 

For me, Cirque isnt so much about following a storyline ... its more about a total sensory experience. The shows that are more surreal and non-linear appeal to me the most - and thats hard to top with Mystére. Its the first Cirque show Ive ever seen,  Ive seen it 3 times, and it remains my favorite today. 

After reading some of the Yelp reviews, its a good thing that theres a little something for everyone with the Vegas Cirque offerings. If youre someone who needs a solid storyline to follow, perhaps Mystére wont be for you ... maybe try KA. 

My favorite place to sit for this (and most every Cirque show) is about half way up in the top center section, as lots goes on around the room and thats the best place to take it all in. If Im too close and can see too much of the details of make up and costume, it loses some of the magic for me. 

If you enjoy artistic visuals, cool sounds and off-beat acrobatics that are beautiful and might not make a lot of sense, then youll enjoy Mystére. Think of it as a surreal, artistic romp."
Mystere,"This was my second Cirque du Soleil show.  I had seen Ka the previous night.  It was a completely different experience and one more akin to what I feel Cirque du Soleil should be.  

The show was a great blend of humor with amazing acts of acrobatics and strength.  Prior to the show starting there was a member of the show who came out and pretending to help guests find their seat, only to screw around with them and it made for a good laugh.  The show itself was fantastic.  A lot of acrobatics such as jumping on trampolines and swinging from trapezes.  I enjoyed the humorous parts of the show as well and there was good audience interaction too.

Our seats were pretty good, we were in the upper level, but had a good view of the stage and the acts.  I would go so far as to say almost all of the seats in the house are good except for the ones on the far right or left of the stage."
Mystere,"Ive been to a few Cirque du Soleil shows and at this point, theyre pretty much the same to me and this one was the worst one. I fell asleep for a bit also. I wish I wouldve gone to see something else, but now I know. 

I dont recommend seeing this if youve seen other cirque shows. However, if its your first time, I think youll have a great experience. The theatre is great with great seating all around."
Mystere,I was able to score the dress rehearsal tickets for $35/ea. The show is definitely open to all ages. There were a lot of children in the audience more so than other cirq shows. It was very comical! I would suggest getting seats in the center back so you can enjoy the show for its entirety instead of craning your head to look up when youre too close to the stage.
Mystere,"Wonderful experience.  Great acrobatics, amazing strong man, and very funny clowns.

This is a show that you can easily take your kids to and be enjoyed by all.  You will love all the energy, great music and beautiful costumes.

Definitely a fan, and will attend again next time in Vegas."
Mystere,"Pretty amazing overall. This was only my second Cirque show Ive seen after I loving Beatles LOVE five years back. 

An abstract surreal circus with some of the most amazing, athletic, and acrobatic acts Ive ever seen, Mystere is visually stunning and exciting. The anarchic grandpa with a suit and converse sneakers was funny, but Im not sure how I felt about the giant baby, though. Those trapeze artists are unbelievable and I started to imagine my life if I was had gone down a path as a Cirque trampoline jumper. Perhaps its time for a new career choice?

Mystere is the original Las Vegas Cirque show. Nothing tops the original, really (though I want to see the critically adored Michael Jackson ONE next)."
Mystere,"AMAZING. 

this was my first ever Cirque du Soleil show ever and I was so impressed!! There was a ton of interaction with the crowd which I wasnt expecting and it seems like every seat in the place is a good one! 
There was live music playing the entire time along with the show which set a sweet vibe throughout the night. 
I didnt understand if there was a storyline to go with the show, but either way it was still silly and high action and perfect for the ADHD- Always something to look at!!! 

The stunts were incredible and kept me interested literally the entire time. I cant believe humans can do some of that stuff!!!

Go see it - you wont be disappointed. Worth every penny!"
Mystere,"I was astounded after having watched Mystere.  After the show was done, I was waiting in the lobby and heard one of the spectators say to his friend, Ive seen a lot of Cirque Du Soleil shows, but Mystere was the best one Ive seen!

It is amazing at the athleticism of these professionals!  Approximately fifteen minutes prior to our show starting, there was a Cirque Du Soleil performer greeting and creating a comedic ruckus while guests were arriving.  He definitely grabbed the audiences attention. 

Heres the reasoning as to why I rated it five stars.

Athleticism:  5/5.  It was amazing to actually see the performances live!!  Seeing it on TV was eehh, but actually seeing their dexterity, agility, strength, and muscular endurance in a live performance was jaw dropping!

Entertainment:  5/5.  When I said jaw dropping, I had my mouth open and held my breath for the performers!  Their feats were truly amazing.  The comedic performer set the tone of Mystere--as he begun to slowly engulf you into the show.  Mystere was very actively involved in audience participation.  So be prepared if youre in the front!!   

Storyline:  5/5.  It appeared not too abstract.  The story about a baby entering a world filled with strange creatures.  

Seating:  5/5.    It is theatrical seating so depending on your vision or preference, no matter where you sit, they are all good seats. I believe the stadium is designed so the audience wont miss a beat!    

Originality:  5/5.  The one and only show that started it all!!!!  Mystere emphasizes on the acrobatics to entertain.  If you plan on watching KA, then expect it to not fit in the same category.

Pricing:  5/5.  One thing Ive learned (Thank you George, our SHOWTIME TOURS bus driver) is you dont need to pay for full price for tickets.  Speak to your concierge or wander around the strip to find a vendor that sells the tickets at a lower price.  Regardless of the price, its worth every penny.  Think about it this way, if you play the slots and lose, why not spend it on creating memories of a fabulous show?

Overall, I recommend everyone to watch this show!  I hope you enjoyed my review and hope you take the time from this hectic world to enjoy Mystere as much as I have. 

**When watching it, please be mindful of the performers and abide by theater rules.  Thank you TI and Cirque Du Soleil for a fabulous experience!!"
Mystere,"How can I give Cirque du Soleil anything under 5 stars??Just doesnt happen. Looked forward to this for a while, was super convenient since I was staying at TI. The venue was a lot smaller than I was expecting, and I had great seats. If youre shy, dont sit in the front section lol. Overall, it was really weird- no apparent plot, but great performances and amazing acrobatics in awesome costumes. Great visuals - kind of reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The music could use a little updating - jazzy/80s. This is known to be one of the better Cirque shows and Id recommend it to others."
Mystere,"I truly enjoyed this show. I have been to other CDS shows but I enjoyed this one the most. Locals get discount for this show, so dont forget to take advantage of that local resident pricing. The show is a lot cheaper during the week day compared to weekend. While we were waiting in the queue to get in (on Sat), staff were selling week day tickets for 25% off. Too bad we couldnt take advantage of that discount, but never theless some one else can."
Mystere,"I remember the grand opening.....  At the Mirage, a special tent was built for this production while Treasure Island was being built!!!!  It was a hit from the very first performance. Have enjoyed this production every time Ive seen it, and its awesome how they improve with each one. Great for every age and all nationalities!"
Mystere,"Cirque du Soleil shows never disappoint. They are always the first choice of show/entertainment in Vegas for us, and they will never disappoint you, you always get a good experience.

As good as it gets, I am not sure if there was a defined story line besides its about a dream of a circus of a baby. All the jumping around, music, singing, acting, comedy, acrobatic are almost always expected from cirque du soleil. However, there wasnt really anything that stands out, nothing too spectacular that I would want to go back again and again. thats why the 4 stars instead of 5.

I would recommend this show definitely."
Mystere,"We just saw this show on 6/1 and it was great! My boyfriend and I were apart of the show towards the end which made it even greater of a show (I thought it was odd we were the only people in our row!!).  My boyfriend got taken up on stage and put in a box and one of the main guys came and sat next to me! Even before the show starts they have a guy interact with the audience, taking peoples tickets and making them walk all around the theater to find their seats.  
We got these tickets through a Groupon deal that included a two night stay and Treasure Island and two show tickets.  We sat in the second row and during some of the acrobatic preformances, we were right in the action!  I would 100% recommend this show to anyone!"
Mystere,"Ive seen a few of Cirque du Soleil shows (KA, LOVE, OvO, Kooza), and this show is one of my favorites!!

I dont want to give too much away, but this show was jam packed full of crazy acrobatics, comedic skits, engaging music, and jaw dropping strength.  We sat in Section 203 (Category 3), and it was a great view.  Majority of the show is done in the air, so being in the upper section is like getting a front row seat.  The show was entertaining from beginning to end, and two hours seemed to fly by.  

If I had to rank the Cirque shows Ive seen itll have to be 1) Mystere, 2) KA, 3) LOVE, 4) OvO, and 5) Kooza.

Mystere is one of the few Cirque shows that offers military and student discounts.  50% off for military and 35% off for students with valid ID.  With these discounts, we got 5 tickets for $275!  Thats was an awesome deal for an excellent show!!"
Mystere,"Fourth CdS show weve seen. It was OK, acrobatics were great, we ended up a bit close to the stage but you see the interaction with audience which is focused towards section 103, i only saw one audience interaction outside of that area.

The baby thing was just weird and too often/long. Maybe they need a lot of setup time between acts.

Didnt seem as long as Ka."
Mystere,"this was my first circus show ever and im so glad i had good experience! this show has many segments of difffernt performers doing different things and all of them were pretty AMAZING! its pretty funny too! the place is pretty small so even though youre in the edge seat, you can pretty much see the whole stage without a problem. i would recommend sitting middle section because at some point people were coming down from the ceiling in the middle area! its pretty crazy! so fun to watch with your family and friends! :)"
Mystere,"This is by far the best show I have ever been to. I am from Missouri so I have been to a ton of Branson shows and several in Vegas. I was absolutely amazed throughout the entire show. 

Mystere is the perfect mix of high intensity acrobatics and riveting humor. It is very crowd involved and it will keep you on the edge of your seat and laughing the entire time.  Last time we went to Vegas we made the mistake of trying a different Cirque show. Not that they arent all amazing, because they are, but I will never go to Vegas and not go to this show again. 

It is definitely a must see!"
Mystere,"This was the first Cirque I ever had the good fortune to attend and after this I was hoooked. It is so quirky and unique. It transports you to the another world. There are so many talented performers  with unique abilities in this show and it really set my precendence of what to expect from a Cirque show. I have seen many others, but this still remains one of my favorites."
Mystere,I thoroughly enjoyed the show. This was a great way to end a vacation trip.
Mystere,"This was my first ever Cirque du Soleil show; I was impressed with what I witnessed. 

Theres not much more to add based on the hundreds of reviews already posted. To those who have not gone to see Mystere, I would describe the show as...mysterious (you should have known I would say that). Theres a lot going on, but the main thing is that the performers keep the crowd engaged from beginning to end. Some of the stunts that were being pulled off I was impressed with. 

Im glad that I got my tickets for the show online, weeks ahead. Once the crew got to Treasure Island Casino, the lines were long  and there was some confusion before the staff started letting people in. Nonetheless, pretty much everyone in the crowd left satisfied afterwards.


My plan will be to come back to Vegas in order to experience some of the other shows; particularly O, Totem, KÀ, and Michael Jacksons One."
Mystere,"Ive been to a few Cirque de Soleil shows in my day, and this one did not disappoint!

Mystere doesnt have a theme, like say Love or KA, but it had all of the elements needed for a truly mesmerizing show (and easier on the pocketbook than most other CdS shows in Vegas).

I always suggest that people go on-line to the Treasure Island website (where the show is located) and use the seat view tool.  It is surprisingly accurate.  My husband and I sat in section 203 row FF, and although we werent in the front row it honestly didnt matter because we felt like we were right there!

If you sit on the aisle or the front-most part of any section, expect a little harassment from the actors before the show (when I say harassment, I mean the kind where the actors will make you the butt of the joke, and people will be laughing at you...all in good fun of course).  At our show some guy got a bucket full of popcorn dumped all over him.  Another girl got moved away from her group into a seat all by herself on the front row.  Its always just for fun, and nothing awful...its what they do at Cirque shows.  Just be prepared for this if you dont like being the center of attention.  :)

The show was stunning.  Acrobats will be suspended in mid air, performing all sorts of awe inspiring feats.  You will see seasoned performers doing back-flips, side flips, rolls, and other tumbling phenoms.  There is even a little nonsensical humor to break up the seriousness.  Oh...did I mention this is all happening at the same time?  You wont know where to focus your attention at times because so much is going on!

Eat before you go...the concession prices at Mystere make movie concessions look like clearance items.

Overall, this is what I would consider a basic CdS show.  I have seen the other reviews people have written where they say this show is disappointingly underwhelming, but I completely disagree.  Thats all hogwash.  In my opinion, Mystere encompasses what Cirque de Soleil is all about.

Definitely a must see!"
Mystere,"I love Cirque shows and most of them do not let you down. Mystere is one of those shows. It is creepy with the baby theme. Once past the initial shudder factor, it is jaw dropping. From start to finish, I was left in awe. 

Just like all of the other shows, this stage is custom built for this production. The flow of each act leaves no down time to catch your breath. The show itself is diverse and has something for everyone. 

A word of advice, come early to get in line. Otherwise it stretches well into the casino."
Mystere,Mystere was my first Cirque du Soleil show.  And its the best one Ive ever seen.  The performance is awesome.  The acrobatics and the music was truly amazing.  This show is always the one I recommend friends to see.
Mystere,"An absolute must to see if youre in Vegas. I repeat do not miss this show. It was Great, Stunning, Fabulous, Amazing, Funny, Dramatic, costumes were vibrant to add movement to each act. Loved it, you will become captivated by the whole show."
Mystere,"Mystere is still a great show after seeing it for my second time and remembering how different some of scenes have changed, but others remained the same as before. In the lobby where we purchased our tickets they had advertised that they had added two new aerial routines.

My gf and I decided to see Mystere since we got a discount for staying at TI and it was well worth it. The seats we had were great with them being right in the middle. This is probably the oldest Cirque production in Las Vegas compared to the others, but still a terrific show.

The performances of the acrobats, trapeze and entertainers kept the audience captivated through all the various stage productions. The interchanging of the acts and the various joke spots make interesting aspects of the Cirque shows very unique. I have seen quite a few of the Cirque shows in Las Vegas and they are all very entertaining in different ways."
Mystere,"Fun show with a TON of crowd interaction. If you sit in section 103, right in front of the stage and along the edges, theres at least a 70% chance youll interact with a performer. At least four people from my show went home with epic stories of being in Mystere.

I dont go to Cirque shows expecting a story, and while I know some have them, I couldnt suss out what this one was (if it existed at all). It mostly comes across as circus acts, which is really all you need. Some parts happen right above you, so if youre close to the stage, it can strain your neck. However, if youre close to the stage, you can see down into the inner-workings, which was a really cool and unexpected feature. 

Ive now seen Mystere and Zarkana - if you want to see a Cirque show that makes you laugh and feel a part of it, Id recommend Mystere over Zarkana. If youre looking for the acts that really make you worried for performer safety? Maybe think about a different show."
Mystere,Enjoyable evening. Fun time. Superior performances!!! Thank you!!!
Mystere,"It was strange..... hahah.

The story reminded me of  Alice in Wonderland in which a girl enters a new dimension. The costumes were so beautiful and creative! Hands down to all the talented gymnasts! The best part of the show was the baby character! He was hilarious! 

Although it was a great show, I found myself getting bored during the bungee and trampoline acts. Everything else was very entertaining. I heard from other people that this show is a bit on the slow side, so Im excited to watch O next time which is supposed to be more high-energy."
Mystere,"This was the first show I ever watched in Vegas this past weekend &amp; it was absolutely magical &amp; breathtaking. I was in awe of the performers the entire time. Such a beautifully crafted show and totally worth every dollar. 

I was a little wary before i actually went because a lot of my friends had already watched other cirque du soleil shows and did not think it was all that good. But from the minute the performers started filling the stage, I was on the edge of the seat,it was that beautiful!!

But Mystère is AS GOOD AS IT GETS....at least for me, I think this it has raised the bar for any performance i plan to watch in the future!

It is a must must must watch!!! :) 
My favorite part of the show was the complete aerial act... so beautiful,i was speechless!"
Mystere,"Ive watched this show 4 times now. The first was when i was a wee 2nd grader or so, and the most recent was as a college grad. Ive seen a few other Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas, (Ka, O, Beatles LOVE) and Mystere is probably the most kid-friendly because of the comedic bits with the clowns and the baby character. I could hear several little kids laughter during our performance. 

This is the OG Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas, so its not as flashy and crazy as, say, O (cheapest ticket for that is $100+, come on), but theres a reason why Mystere has been around for so long :) Id say this is a good intro show if youve never seen Cirque du Soleil before.

Arrive 30 min early to catch all of the clowns antics! I always secretly wished he would dump popcorn on me... but alas I was never chosen.

ALSO to the man who played the main Red Bird character... you were so hot and amazing and graceful. Thank you for scaring the shit out of us when you popped up on the railing 5 inches in front of our faces. You made our night."
Mystere,So. Much. Fun. I loved watching this show the entire time and I also love how active they were with the audience. It made me feel like I was apart of the show!
Mystere,"Amazing! I was constantly in awe of the talent of these performers! They put Olympic gymnasts to shame (or perhaps they are former Olympic gymnasts). The costumes were innovative and gorgeous, the stunts breathtaking and the humour... mildly amusing. 
The concierge at our hotel recommended it as a good Cirque show when you cant decide which Cirque show to see. 
I had my small service dog with me so they moved us to the disabled seating section. This had an added benefit of more comfortable seats and no one on either side of us. My dog slept through the entire show.
I loved that the concession stand had popcorn, as Id been randomly smelling popcorn all throughout Vegas and was really craving some. 
I agree with another reviewer who said its a great starter Cirque show."
Mystere,"Super duper duper AWESOME! This was my first live Cirque du Soleil show and I was completely amazed the entire time! We got front row seats thanks to a nice guy at the box office, and were able to see everything up close and personal! The fake usher who appeared in the audience before the show started and then popped out throughout the show was hilarious, as was the giant baby who kept looking for his papa. The music was also outstanding, as were all the incredible feats of athleticism and strength throughout the show. Soooo cool! I would definitely recommend this show to those who want to be amazed and entertained. Worth every penny!"
Mystere,"So fun!  This is the only Cirque show in Vegas that allows very young children.  We bought a family 4 pack which included popcorn and drinks.  The seats that come with the family pack arent the best but the theatre isnt that big so it wasnt an issue for me. But it didnt matter because the super nice usher ladies upgraded our seats! My kids, ages 4 and 1 LOVED the show.  The 4 year old was mesmerized the whole time. It was amazing to watch my kids reactions to the acrobats, dancers, lights, colors and characters.  We almost didnt go because I was afraid they might be too young, but im so glad we did! Great memories."
Mystere,"Amazing. Breathtaking. Beautiful. And funny!

This is a strange, strange world and theres so much to look at, listen to, and just...take in. Its almost over-stimulating, but in a good way! Know that if you come see Mystere, youre entering a world thats curious, enticing, and nonsensical. Literally....nothing makes sense. Or maybe I should say the storyline was too obscure or complicated for me - even so, I loved it!

The stage itself has amazing technical capabilities, and transforms into ways you cannot predict or imagine. The costumes are gorgeous, the choreography is amazing, and the acts themselves are unlike any other Ive seen (duh - its Cirque du Soleil!) Truly impressive stunts. The performers are superhuman! :)

My favorite part of the show is that its interactive. The audience is made to feel like theyre a part of the show. So much fun!

As my first Cirque show, I was beyond impressed and cant wait to see the next one!"
Mystere,"Mystere gets rave reviews from both my mama and I!  I took my mom here as part of her 50th birthday weekend in Vegas and it was her first Cirque show.  What a great first show for her!  It was my 6th Cirque show and I loved it just as much!  Being Cirques first permanent show in Vegas, Mystere is pure acrobatics.  The performers do such a great job at what they do, and they do some amazing things!  I cant imagine being able to contort my body in some of the ways they do.

Mysteres stage is set up in a way that there truly isnt a bad seat in the house.  We got tickets from Tix 4 Tonight (see review of them separately), but honestly I think there are better deals to be had on Cirques website if youre a Cirque Club member (sign up online for free) and purchase tickets in advance.  Unfortunately, I was booking last minute and the discounted tickets were sold out.  Anyhow, we sat three rows back on the side of the stage and still had great view of everything.  There were a couple times I wished we were seated more head-on, but it really wasnt bad at all.

The crowd interaction before the performance was fantastic and entertaining.  The show was incredible and had my mom and I walking out of there saying, WOW!  I highly recommend this show if youre looking for a show in Vegas.  Mystere is definitely in my top three in Vegas, along with O and KA."
Mystere,"After seeing Cirque du Soleil - Iris at the Kodak Theater, we decided to see four Cirque shows as part of our Vegas weekend experience.  This is one of my favorite Cirque shows!  

Big production, great music, talented acrobats, funny performers...I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the show.  Next time I am in Vegas, I would love to see it again!  Of the Cirque shows I have seen,Mystere, Zumanity, and Iris are my favorites.  Each show is unique, but all fabulous in their own right."
Mystere,"This is the second Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen in Vegas. And I must say, its more enjoyable than the first. First off, I must comment on their physique...can we say totally fit?! The cast all look like theyre in top shape and probably have to work out a lot.  The price to pay for a great body, subjectively speaking, of course.  

I was impressed by all the acrobatic moves.  The show was definitely worth the money that I didnt pay as it kept my attention.  One of the most memorable parts of the show was when the performers were climbing up a pole and making it look waaay too easy.  Thats gotta require mad skills and strength.  The other part is when buff guy 1 was using only his hands to carry buff guy 2. And buff guy 2 was holding himself rigid, which probably required a lot of focus. 

So, in summary, if you want to be entertained by watching a bunch of totally fit people performing unbelievable feats, then I recommend that you check this show out. Not to mention, itll hopefully encourage some of us to get off the couch and get in shape. Enjoy!"
Mystere,"I had a blast. From the beginning of the show until the very end, I did not stop smiling. Everything was so captivating and I truly enjoyed it. I even got to be part of the show, now everybody calls me Mama."
Mystere,"***  200th review!!!! ***

And I saved it for the highlight of my Vegas trip this past weekend--Mystere!!

On my previous trip to Vegas, I saw my first Cirque show, Zumanity.  Boy was I let down--it was not at all what I was expecting.  I wanted to be wowed, amazed, astonished.  And above all, I wanted to feel that the steep price tag was worth it.  

Thank goodness I saw Mystere this time around--it turned out to be just the kind of show I wanted to see.  I couldnt stop gasping, laughing and smiling the whole time. The performers were so strong,  precise, and artistic.  It was utterly mind blowing and I loved every second of it.  

Take advantage of their discounted seating--I got tickets for about $75 and it was well worth the price.  Also, the theater is small, and I would imagine any seat--even the ones in the back--are good.  Just make sure you sit toward the center of the theater, not on the edges."
Mystere,"My very first Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas.  And what a way to start off a new love affair.

As usual, I had no idea what to expect entering the theater for Mystere, but thats par for the course.  Each show is so completely different and unique, yet all are completely awe-inspiring.

I was in love with the costumes and makeup and marveled at the awesome mastery, strength and grace of all the performers.  Although the story line was a little hard to follow (especially since no known language is used), the plot line translated pretty well and each act was more awe-inspiring than the last.

I left the theater on Cloud 9 with my jaw on the floor, and a renewed desire to run away and join Cirque du Soleil as a contortionist.  Words cant really do justice to the visual mastery these shows present, and I cannot recommend it strongly enough to anyone to go and see.  

Twice more Ive been back to Vegas since that initial visit, and each time I saw another Cirque show.  And I cant wait to go back again and see another."
Mystere,"Cirque de Soleil shows will always be amazing, no matter what. You enter the show knowing that the selection of actors, acrobats, and performers are extreme professionals at what they do. So of course, there were many moments in this show where we were ooo-ing and ahh-ing.

My favorite part of the show was the grown-up man that was dressed in a baby costume. Its always nice to go to a show that involves humor. I wasnt a fan of the actor dressed up like Einstein though or the host with the puppet but I could see the majority of the audience loved them.

The acrobatic choreography is incredible, IF this is your first Cirque de Soleil show. For me, this was my third (Id already seen Ka and Zumanity) and out of all three, Mystere was the least impressive. I feel that this show was more steered at incorporating the phenomenon of colors and designs, rather than telling a story or highlighting a specific theme. There are some elements that are repeated too, like the woman performing on the long drapes (they did the same segment in Zumanity).

Also, there will be numerous moments throughout the show when youre just raising your eyebrows because you have no idea what is going on. The flow of the different segments performed...has no organization or transition. Occasionally, theyll go back and forth between the baby, Einstein look-alike, and the host with the puppet. But as for the rest of the performances, just understand that its all at random.

The most confusing thing...was the ending. I dont want to ruin it for anyone so I wont state how the ending is. But if youve seen it, you know what I mean. You expect something more amazing or awesome to happen at the end, but my exact reaction was...THATs it?!

Maybe I shouldve just coughed up the extra money and seen O instead."
Mystere,"Loved everything about this show. The acrobatics are phenomenal! The way they press the body to extreme is crazy! I will definately see more of their shows! But, if youre going to go, you have to have the ability to appreciate and get into it. The clown and the baby...hilareous. I just loved everything about it. The contortionists, the acrobatics, the trapeze artists, the dancers. Great show. Worth every penny. I was awed and amazed!"
Mystere,"Amazing!  My palms were sweating, my heart was pounding, and I just couldnt get enough.  My only previous Las Vegas show was Blue Man Group about a decade ago.  At the time I was in high school and a teacher I was with told me that I would love Cirque du Soleil.  He was not wrong!  

Everything from the performers to the music is top notch.  Even the pre-show entertainment reaches a high standard.  I was in awe through the entire performance and was sad to see it end.  Overall, I think this is a great first show for anybody visiting Las Vegas."
Mystere,"Loved it!! 

The acrobatics are incredible.  There were so many moments where I was holding my breath because what they were doing was so crazy cool and seemingly impossible.  No one fell, messed up or missed a step, although there were a few close calls.  These performers must be top notch because they pulled off so many difficult acrobatics.  The only other show Ive seen on the strip was La Reve but I would have to say that I like Mystere much more.  I liked the costumes, the music, and the style of dancing as well. 

My favorite part was the 2 guys doing handstand press ups on each other.  At one point, one of them was doing a handstand on the other guys foot that was suspended in the air.  My other favorite part was the teeter-totter action.  Two guys would trade off launching eachother high in the air...and while in the air, theyd do backflips and twists.  I used to be a gymnast and I know how much muscle, skill and control it needs to do this type of stuff.  Purely incredible!! 

We were in the nose bleed seats because we booked kind of late but it was still great.  I think anywhere you sit will give you a good view so dont worry about buying the most expensive seats."
Mystere,"As a huge Cirque du Soleil fan, I have seen Dralion, O twice, Quidam, Ovo, Zarkana and Zumanity before watching Mystere. I was doubtful going into Mystere that I would be amazed since many Cirque shows tend to repeat themselves in terms of acts. Boy, was I in for a surprise.

Mystere is one of the funniest Cirque shows I have ever seen! I dont want to ruin it for you but the main clowns are hilarious! The acts are also of high difficulty, and I was impressed even after seeing so many Cirque shows. The stage moves as well so if you sit in the front rows, youll get to see just what happens! Im not sure if those in the back can see what happens when a part of the stage descends, but from the front rows, there was definitely a good view.

Overall, it was a fun and impressive show. The costumes were beautifully done too along with the music. Oh, there was a ton of audience interaction as well so be anxious to see what happens!"
Mystere,"BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OK If you have seen the show you dont need my opinion, and if you havent seen the show I wont ruin it for you.  So whats the point of my review?  Besides sharing my insightful words with you in Yelp-land?  Is to tell you what experiences made this show amazing for me,

OK, so first.....  As we were walking in to the stadium (late) there was a Tall HANDSOME italian man eying me.  I gave him the eye and smile and darn near ran in the place to take my seat.  Well, it worked.  After the show was over there he was waiting for me (and my mom).  He said he bought a ticket to see the show just to meet me.  OMG!  Well he took us both to a late dinner and drinks.  And I saw him everyday for the remaining of my trip.  After the trip was over we never spoke again, but he swept me off my feet.  And that accent.... Yum.

Next, and this is the big one.  So like I was saying we were late.... as we were running to our seats i noticed the spotlight was on.  OK, show is starting hurry mom come on. Oh wait, is the spotlight on me?  OMG what do I do what do I do.  Well i put my head down and try and scoot by the people in my way.  Hey, what is everyone laughing at?  Well let me tell you what everyone was laughing at.  The MC followed me the whole time and pulled a fake bra from behind me.  The WHOLE stadium was laughing and I was ready to cry.  Lol, during intermission everyone in the bathroom kept saying You are the girl with the bra.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA It was embarrassing but a once in a lifetime experience.  

So go, and be late lol."
Mystere,"Stunningly beautiful, nothing less than what I had expected from Cirque du Soleil.

Set: The set is stunning, as always! Performers are free to interact with the audience members because doors on either side of the stage open up into the seating area. Arial performers literally drop from the skies and do complex tricks on complex apparatus. Its a very vivid stage, and theres always a lot going on! Thats one of the reasons why I actually prefer to sit in the back, because I get to enjoy the entire performance as a whole and see everything :). The stage can rise and sink, so performers (as well as giant snails) can appear and disappear into the ground. Its not as amazing as the constantly-morphing pool/stage at O, but the stage dynamics are still amazing nonetheless.

Music: A little hypnotic, actually almost sent my boyfriend to sleep even though he was very fascinated by the acts. Im looking forward to watching Iris because the score is composed by none other than Danny Elfman, one of my favorite score composers of all time. The live singers and live orchestra are flawless though.

Clowns: The baby is probably my favorite clown... out of ALL cirque du soleil shows I have watched so far. Hes so cute!~ pa-pa~ haha... the PaPa of our show was a small kid from the audience, and it was really amusing to watch.

Acrobats: All acrobatic acts were phenomenal. PERIOD.

Dancers: The Red Bird was soooo breathtakingly amazing. His dance technique, performance, stage presence... I was practically in love! The character had a hint of mystery, playfulness, and power all at the same time. La Bella and the Black Widow were played by two very amazing female dancers, and my first thought when I saw them was dayummm girl, lookit them abs!!! Haha. I love dancing, so I really loved how so much dancing was incorporated into this show :).
 
I particularly loved how the performers removed their masks at the end of the performance. It reminded me of how human they really are, despite the fact that they took me to a whole other magical world during the show."
Mystere,"After having been to several of the newer Cirque du Soleil shows I must say that Mystere was a let down in comparison. The venue was far smaller and the production was not as impressive. However, having said that, if this is your first experience with Cirque du Soleil, then Id suggest you making it Mystere. For a first timer, Mystere gives you all the wonders of Cirque and introduces you to what it is all about.

There were moments where it was seriously slow and I could tell lil guy was bored. We took him to see KA last time and it was very fast paced so he was completely on the edge of his seat the entire time. With Mystere, he was fidgety and I caught him yawning a few times as well. But, there were bits in there which was extremely cute and with audience participation, it kept the slow bits moving along just when you feel like dozing off.

A great first time Cirque du Soleil experience, but cant be compared to the extravaganza of the newer productions."
Mystere,"Cirque du Soleil has yet to fail me. I wasnt expecting much with Mystere because everyone and their mama raves about all the other spectacular shows in Vegas. They all say to start off with Mystere and work your way up. With that notion, I think Mystere is underated.

If you ordered your tickets online, youll most likely need to show up a bit before your show time and pick up your tickets at will call. The process is simple, show the printed confirmation and your legit ID (of the CC holder) and they will hand you your tickets. I saw a huge line of people, anxiously waiting for the doors to open. Wait a minute, theyre assigned seats, whats the hurry? We didnt bother waiting, so we hit up the craps table. When most of the people were already in the theatre, we then casually strolled in.

I got the category 3 seats which was located right next to the middle control booth. They were perfect! Not only close to exits but right smacked in the middle. Those seats were not too far back and not too close to the front where you would walk out of there with a neck cramp because you have to keep looking up at the acts above your head.

What I really was amazed with was the stage. The elevating stages were uncalled for and very effective. When I first got into the theatre, I didnt know what to expect. Once I saw the floors moving like crazy, I was impressed.

The acts... well go decide that for yourself but I thought it was pretty cool and entertaining overall.

I would definitely recommend this show to others. Good for everyone of all ages for the most part."
Mystere,"I would echo most of what fellow Yelpers said. Ive been to a couple Cirque shows, and this one certainly does not disappoint. 

I would definitely say this one comes close to the Beatles Love show. The acrobatics are awesome, and the two guys doing the balancing acts were unbelievable! That part alone was worth 4.5 stars. 

They also kept the show moving at a rather brisk pace at most points (which doesnt let each act become boring). However, I would say some of the parts were really cheezy (including the baby and the popcorn guy in the beginning of the show. I found a comment from a little girl behind us perfect. She shouted isnt he doing the same thing over and over again? How is that funny?). Other than these parts, I thought the special effects, moveable stage, and actors were awesome. 

If you have to see one Cirque show, go for Love. Otherwise, I would say Mystére is not far behind (it is also the original Cirque show in Vegas)."
Mystere,Very disappointed.  The baby act did not fit the performance.  We saw a traveling show in Washington DC years ago and had better entertainment for the money.  Felt like a circus act rather than professional show.  We thought we would see something spectacular in Vegas.  So very disappointed in the show.
Mystere,"Attended this show with family members including kids aged 12-15. Previously, Ive seen a few other Cirque shows in LA and Vegas with the most recent being Love. The kids were newbies so we bought some last minute tickets to the Treasure Island venue and off we went. 

We all loved this show! Its the oldest running Cirque show in Vegas and it was fabulous.
It had all the elements on which Cirque du Soleil has built their empire--acrobats and aerialists, strong men, humorous characters, gorgeous costumes, drama and thrills. Go see it."
Mystere,"I am reviewing this show even though I didnt see it.  I received a Cirque Gift card and wanted to see a Cirque show using the gift card to purchase tickets.  I inquired about the locals discount, since I live in Henderson, and was told I couldnt combine the 2.  Either had to use the gift  card or the locals deal.  Super bummed, cause I will never be able to use the gift card because I cant afford it."
Mystere,"An A-OK show to catch in Vegas, especially when the tickets go for $55 a pop. Granted its not the closet seat, but the stage is small anyway. 

Its a very acrobatic show with lots of twists, turns, flips, and more. And its also very funny! They have a few characters on the show that are just there for extra comedy, so its not all serious stunts. 

Definitely entertaining and worthwhile... but only if the tickets are on sale."
Mystere,Mystere is a Real No Nonsense Cirque du Soleil show at its best.  I found out reading another review that it has been going strong for over 20 years! Which i can understand no gimmicks or themes just a real good show with a incredible amount of performers and acrobatic acts. I sat on the side towards the back and had a great view. I dont think there is a bad seat in the house. really enjoyed the show. Would recommend and keep a look out for the local special. It saved me a ton of money.
Mystere,Pretty entertaining. Kept my attention the entire time. I had never been to a Cirque du Soeil show. I was very pleased. I think we are going to check out Zumanity next time. I would also like to see Ka.
Mystere,"This was my first cirque du soleil show ever so I have nothing to compare it to but wow, it was amazing. I chose this show over the other cirque du soleil shows because there was an online 30+% off deal so the ticket was like ~$43ish for middle seating. Our seats were towards the center of the auditorium so we got a really good view of the stage but the orientation of the room gives any seat a good view since a lot of the acts were in the air anyways. 

My friends and I were scared wed be late so we RAN into the auditorium and were escorted to the aisle... only to find out that one of the actors of the show pulled my friend to be chosen as a participant to kill some time before the show starts. All of a sudden we hear wedding music and people cheering. The actor asked my friend to kiss him on the cheek and when she was about to, he kissed her on the lips instead. The most action I got in Vegas was from an OLD MAN! 

It was my bfs first show ever so he was really amazed. WOW, WHOA, OMG were all people could hear if they sat near him. 

I would definitely suggest this show for the price and quality of the acts. You wont regret it!"
Mystere,"We are locals that often have friends visiting from out of state. This most recent batch asked to see a Cirque show.  I told them that Mystere might be a good start - none of us have seen one of your shows. They booked rooms at TI and we purchased tickets for tonights show, Tuesday, October 10, 2017 at 9:30pm in the front row 105, seats 1,2&amp;3.  We stood in line to get tickets, stood in line 35 minutes to get into the theater, stood in line to give the snack bar $20 for 2 bottles of water and a coke, and then sat in our, excellent, seats for another 30 minutes eagerly anticipating the show but was told, 35 minutes after showtime, to exit our seats and proceed to the exits where those of us who bought tickets could get our money back.  As if ticket price should cover our investment?  Because you couldnt pull your sh** together enough to go on, you SQUANDERED OUR CASH (ticket price doesnt reflect wasted, over-priced concessions), WASTED OUR TIME, and most heinous of all you EXPLOITED OUR EXCITEMENT.   For you it might have been just another Tuesday night; for us it was special.  Never again, Cirque."
Mystere,I Have seen several Cirque shows and this is one of my favorites.  The costumes and stage are beautiful.  The acrobatics are amazing and the show is funny and interactive too.  Would see it again!
Mystere,"My first CDS show, early-mid 90s, it was a blast.  Im honestly more of an old school strip guy.  I love Flamingo, Caesars, and many of the places that have been gutted, imploded, rebuilt, or died.  But Im a fan of the new Vegas too.  This was sort of a turning point for me.  Ive recommended this show to hundreds of friends visiting.  Well OK there, Hotshot, dozens.  A dozen!  Ish.  Fuckoff with your judgement, I have a bunch of friends on Facebook and some of them have been to Nevada.  My POINT is that everyone who saw this or O has thanked me for the emphatic recommendation.  So, dont take my word for it.  This time I have references."
Mystere,"I have seen Mystere about 3 times and I liked all of the times I went.  The acrobats are amazing and so is the sound.  The venue is quite intimate.  This is a good show, especially since the prices have dropped so low."
Mystere,"This was one of my first Cirque shows in Vegas.  Ive since seen them all, however Mystere is definitely one of my favorite of ALL the Cirque shows Ive seen, and believe me when I tell you Ive seen my fair share over the years.  Not just in Vegas but also the ones that tour in LA, Santa Monica, and Orange County.  I heart this particular program.  The arena its shown in at Treasure Island is perfect.  There is not a bad seat in the house.  I sat in the premiere seating because Im a seat snob like that, but I remember thinking that it was not really necessary.  Shhhhh.  Dont tell HIM is said that!  

I love the music, the giant snail, the funny comic skits, the amazing male acrobats (think they are brothers).  Its worth it to see the show just to see their piece in this production.  The strength and balance they demonstrate is pure power.  These guys were featured on Oprah a few seasons ago too.      

Yes, O at the Bellagio is the Cirque du Soleil show everyone talks about, and it is incredible, but trust me Mystere is amazing!  

My very favorite Cirque show in Vegas is The Beatles LOVE!   But I do adore the Beatles and that show totally rocks!!   Least favorite Cirque show in Vegas:  I sort of hated Zumanity.  It was a little tacky for my taste, but to be fair, it just was not my type of humor!  My sister LOVED it!

If you are trying to pick between shows, Mystere is a winner! xo"
Mystere,"This show was absolutely amazing! It was the first time I had seen Mystere, but I was told that this show has been running for 20 years. The acrobatics are breath-taking. The acts made me so nervous that they would fall or something, but their routines were flawless. I didnt completely understand the storyline of the show though. All the characters seemed completely random. But nonetheless, the makeup and costumes looked great!"
Mystere,"This would be my 3rd Cirque du Soleil show that Ive see, others being Ka and Kooza. Its pretty good, but in a sense I kind of expected more. This is a good show for people who are new to the scene. There are some great acts such as the cube and pole acrobatic scenes. What I do love are the moving platforms and crazy backgrounds that are native to Cirque du Soleil.

If you are looking for something mindblowing, I would recommend something like O."
Mystere,"This is my 6th Cirque du Soleil show. I absolutely love their productions. However, this one is my least favorite so far. I still enjoyed the show very much, it is interactive and funny. The music and stage is great as always. But the artists in this show dont seem to be on the same level as the others. On the performance I went to, there were a lot of small mistakes on very basic (basic by Cirque du Soleil standard) moves. I have seen much better acrobatic skills in their other shows. 

Overall, it is still a good show. But I would recommend to go see KA, O, Zummanity, OVO, and IRIS first :)"
Mystere,"What? Just? Happened?

Seriously.. what happened.  Its been a long time since Ive felt pretty much every single emotion there was and is to feel in an hour and a half.

Throughout the years, I never cared to pay attention to what this idea was behind the whole Cirque du Soleil extravaganza.. I never realized what it actually was and wasnt interested in knowing but holy man cannoli moly.. I have been changed.

So I suppose I should tell you what happened? Yes.  The group I went with to Vegas decided to check out one of the shows, this Mystere was the one with available tickets so we got them online pre-trip.  Fine.  FYI there is a check-in offer.. two tickets for $100; we saw that when we checked-in.  Now, granted you must forgo the pre-ordering tickets and chance that there will be some there (and there were.. but we didnt know).  The tickets came out to be about $70 each for us with fees, since the ring-leader of the group brought up the fact of the Yelp check in, we ended up with a big up-grade on our seats. Score.

So we sat pretty much dead center.. OH let me tell you about walking in. Okay, so you go in they scan the ticket and you walk up the find the seat.  I did not venture to the restrooms but there was a snack stand in the lobby.  The theater itself is not that large which I at first thought was strange for such a widely in demand show, however it later proved to me that it made perfect sense.  It may have held 300 people? Not sure..

So we grabbed our seats, smack in the middle almost.. nice! We had original tickets for the right side of the stage towards the top, we ended up 5-6 rows from the stage. Incredible.  As we were seated, others were coming in and they had a guy walking around involving the audience.. he would pretend to be an usher (he had a spot light on him) and the people would almost have no choice but to follow him and hed take them all up and around and kick people out of their seats for them and so forth.  It was pretty funny to watch, he threw pop-corn at people and acted as if he spilled it, I mean, Im just smiling thinking about this insanity that happened during the entirety of me being in that theater. 

ANYWAYS I really dont want to give it away.. it started and honestly the emotions I felt were so powerful.. shock and awe, happiness, sadness, anxiousness, regretful that I hadnt given a thought to the performance in the past.. my body hurt watching what these people do.

The babies, involving the audience, the two guys holding one another.. the people with the face on them, pole-craziness.. bars and trapeze like, whoa I dont even know what to say..

They are true artists and it is completely unbelievable what I witnessed during this performance.  I want to tell them thank you, for doing what they do.  None of them will read this and there are practically 500 reviews, but seriously.. you all did such an outstanding job and to do it over and over for the audience that watches you.. THANK YOU.  

To the masterminds behind creating this.. wow.  Incredible concept.. stage design.. lighting.. props.. musical talent.. fantastic job everybody. Im so honored to have been able to see what I saw."
Mystere,"Excellent show! I came in not expecting much since there are so many variations of Cirque Du Soleil and this one has been around way too long, but I was still very impressed.

You can also get a great deal for tickets if you are staying at Mirage or Treasure Island. Tickets are buy one get one free if you are a guest.

Not going to give away much but just two words, GREAT SHOW!"
Mystere,"This is tough to review. Before Mystere Id seen Ka, O, LOVE, &amp; Zumanity. All newer and flashier.
If you go in having seen those and not an open mind, youll be disappointed. If you remember this was Cirque du Soleils first resident show in Vegas (or anywhere, I think) it helps.
If you have only seen the traveling shows or never been to Cirque... Dive right in!
Taken at face value: it fun, exciting, and has proper Cirque Wow! moments. Definitely worth seeing. 

The Good: Of all the Vegas Cirque shows, this one probably has the most audience participation (maybe Zumanity is close). If you like that kind of thing its pretty funny. 
The Bad: Its showing its age a bit, but like I said, if you dont let its big, expensive siblings color your judgement, its still exciting and worth the $$.
The Creepy: Sorry, I know theyre supposed to be funny, but that baby is disturbing."
Mystere,"Amazing. Jaw dropping. Incredible. Magnificent. This show was equal parts all these things and more. 

This was my very first Cirque du Soleil show and Im hooked. Everything from the music, to the talent, to the visual effects was superb and inspiring.   Its incredible to see people bend and move in ways that seem near impossible. No lie, I definitely threw out a whole lotta holy Fs and omfgs. 

The show has a humorous side to it too with a fat baby crying around and a random old guy in a suit who goes around throwing popcorn at the audience. 

All in all, the show was breathtaking and visually stunning and the giant snail at the end is brilliant! Go watch it people, I promise you itll be worth the mulah!"
Mystere,"Im confused, but amazed at the same time. I loved it, and hated it at the same time too. I am conflicted. 

The people were amazing. I cant believe they did some of the things they did. True athletes. 

The problem: I was lost like I didnt know if I should be getting something or if I was missing it. To many buff men getting to friendly with other buffed men scared me a bit. Some of the costumes were also hard to look at. 

In all seriousness. It was awesome and am very glad I got to see a Cirque show in Vegas. Next time, the Beatles.  This overall was a dissapointment and waste of money (see the confliction) ..... thus, one star and I cant recommend it to anyone and would never go to it again myself."
Mystere,Amazing show!!! This is my second cirque de soile show and it wont be my last!! Amazing acts my husband and I really enjoyed it!! I just wish they had more drink selections.
Mystere,"I am reviewing all the Cirque Vegas shows, so I will add this paragraph comparing each one. I have seen each one twice (and saw LOVE 3 times), so I feel confident in my ranking. My ranking would be 1) Ka 2) Love 3) O 4) Mystere 5) Zumanity 6) Viva Elvis. Ka is the most technically complete, with a storyline, amazing stunts, creative images, stages rotating on axes, etc.  LOVE is the most fun and a very close second place.  O is the most beautiful. Mystere has the best stunts and is most traditional. Zumanity is the sexiest, but stunts are just okay. And Viva Elvis could be sooo much better.  You can read my other reviews for more info...

Like I said, Mystere has the best stunts. It is what you might expect. There are more creative Cirque shows in Vegas, but this one is a good starting point. 

I cant stand that stupid man-baby, though, that they bring in for comic relief. 
Ma-ma... I still have nightmares about that man-baby. However, most of the audience seemed to be laughing. So NOT my brand of humor, but I guess they need to have time to set up for the next act.   Anyway, if the man-baby lights your fire, then perhaps youd love the show. But I have a love hate relationship with this show."
Mystere,"Amazing show! You never go wrong with Cirque du Soleil they keep impressing you with the cool stunts, make up, costumes and themes. Its fun for any ages. Was so happy woth my experience I just loved it!"
Mystere,"CLASSIC. I remember watching this as a kid, and now I just rewatched it 12 years later. I still remember bits and pieces of it and it hasnt strayed much since then. Being way too young to appreciate the freaky costumes I remember begging my mom and dad to let me go back to the rooms. The fat baby used to give me nightmares as well as those guys with fat bellies that would balance on top of the giant balls. 

The adult me can now appreciate it, and I have. The fat baby is no longer creepy, just gross, and the guys that can balance on balls are still ugly. But now I have a deeper appreciation for what they do. It must be incredibly difficult to perform day in and day out without messing up. So I commend them. The show in itself started the whole Cirque craze in vegas and really, high flying acrobatics will always take my breath away. Compared to the other extravagant shows like O and Ka, those who watch Mystere might bad talk, but remember.. this is the one that started it all."
Mystere,"I loved this one!  The tricks they did were phenomenol, it seriously blew my mind.  This was the first Cirque Du Soleil show I ever saw and its still my favorite to date.  The order goes like this: Mystere, Ka, then Zumanity.

The production and everything was just stunning!  I really want to see O because I heard its the best one."
Mystere,"Ditto Chip Ks Review. 

I have seen La Reve, Mystere and Zumanity.  Mystere was by far the WORST of them all.  I would not pay to see Mystere again.  The only reason the BF and I went was because we got an awesome package deal at TI.

Agreed -  The male performer dressed in a baby suit rolling the gigantic orange ball off the stage was awful.  The continuous crying by this character became extremely annoying and seemed out of place.

Overall, I would not recommend this show...unless you get in for free."
Mystere,This was a great show!  The Brazilian brothers were AMAZING!!!  The strength of the base brother is ridiculous.  I would recommend this show for sure.  Although the Chubby Baby in a diaper was funny and a little disturbing   It really was good!!
Mystere,"very nice show. Worth watching! the theater is not insanely huge, thus also the last seats have a decent view. Show is about 1.45 hours and scans through various performances with same theme. Amazing the effects created by scenario and light.
Only lack to get to 5* is the price, pretty expensive compared to same show in other parts of the world.
Nevertheless, I suggest seeing it!!! :)"
Mystere,This was my first cirque show so I didnt really know what to expect but I was a bit disappointed. The performance skill was great but for me the story was a bit odd. I wouldnt recommend for my family and friends to see it unless they were offering a great deal on the tickets.
Mystere,"YAAAWNNNNN......EEEEEEK!!! Zzzzzzz.........

My least favorite Cirque du Soleil show e-v-e-r.

I cant even begin to tell you what a yawn fest it was.....Was it visually stunning? Sure. But, that was where my interest faded. And what was up with the creepy baby character? For petes sake if I wanted to see a creepy man in a diaper, Im sure I couldve gone down to Fremont Street and found that for free."
Mystere,"By far the BEST Cirque show on The Strip. Music, performers, storyline are outstanding. Sit further back fro stage at basically all Cirque shows for best experience."
Mystere,"Thanks to Cirque du Soleil-Mystere, I am no longer a Cirque du Soleil virgin! My husband and I saw Mystere with 4 of our friends (he didnt want to go, but got outvoted). My skeptical husband ended up loving the show, and now wants to see more Cirque du Soleil shows! Our whole group, including myself, absolutely loved the show. At times we were holding our breath or just had our jaws dropped in pure awe of their strength, flexibility and athleticism.

We got our tickets from the Tix4Tonight booth (Showcase Mall Booth location) and the wait wasnt too bad around 11am. Everywhere else was selling last minute Mystere tickets for $100+, we got ours for $69, plus tax, etc. Good enough for us!

Venue/Seating: The theatre is a decent size, and we got seats dead centre near the very back and Id have to say...it looks like there really is no bad seat in the house! Even from the very back, youre not that far away. The seats are arranged like a horseshoe, so I dont know what the view is like from the end of the horseshoe. So Id actually recommend NOT wasting your money on sitting in the front rows, so you dont have to strain your neck looking up all the time (been there, done that before).

TIP: Get to your seats EARLY (like 10-15 minutes before curtain call)....I cant tell you why because itll ruin the fun. But once youre in your seats early, pay attention to the crowd finding their seats and youll thank me :)

Overall: I loved the show - great for all ages! I gave it only 4 stars out of 5 because I didnt really care for the storyline...I just liked seeing all the acts! But Im definitely a Cirque du Soleil fan for life now..seeing Totem next!"
Mystere,"Really wanted to run out screaming several times.  I thought it was just me, but my husband and the couple we were with also thought is was like someones acid trip.  Really, no story line, nothing bringing the acts together, just randomness and really weird costumes.  Thankfully, our tickets were only $50 plus fees came to $65 each.
I will say, there were several great acts, such as the two brothers doing the strength/balancing.  AMAZING!!! Truly.  The music was phenomenal, including the special sound effects.  Still, that was background for a lot of very strange things.  A grown man pretending to be a baby and talking baby talk?  Ick.  Hairy legs and all.  I dont want to take away from the performers, since they did their jobs very well, but the presentation is horrible, unless you just smoked some crack."
Mystere,"My first Cirques show and definitely wasnt my last show.

I think this one of the must see show in Vegas. Its funny, witty, colorful, with amazing stunts. Seats were comfortable and you can pretty much see the show from any angle of your seats. 

I just wished people in front of us werent such loud obnoxious drunk couple. They giggled and made comments during the show. I think they will need to add a policy of no drunktards will be allow during the show."
Mystere,"My third Cirque show and I rate it last out of the three.  I enjoyed Love and Zumanity much more.  This show felt dated, the 80s music didnt help.  There were awkward pauses with random clapping every few seconds by different sections of the audience not knowing when to clap and when to wait.  Frankly, about 80% of the show consisted of 20 performers just running back and forth on the stage to give the appearance of a lot going on when really, theres not.  Watch for it.  This show badly needs an update.  Meantime, good for families with kids and maybe as your first Cirque show if you get free or discounted tickets."
Mystere,Amazing show. I have been to others before but this one is funny throughout and has a great story line. Make sure you dont blink because the stunts are amazing as well. It is great for the whole family to see and it is definitely a show that you will remember.
Mystere,"I was very impressed with my first experience at a Cirque du Soleil show. This show is a flawlessly performed act of trapeze, strongmen, climbing, trampolines, balancing and comedy. 
Before we entered the show, I ordered a double Crown and 7, which was reasonably priced and was told that the bar closes as soon as the show starts, so drink up early people. 
We were greeted and luckily not picked on, by the shows primary comedian as we walked to our seats. As he singled out different couples around the crowd to have a little fun with, the whole place was able to have a good laugh before the show started. The music, visuals, and physical talent were all very impressive and have prompted an interest to see more of Vegas Cirque attractions. We got our tickets at a TIx 4 Tonight kiosk for $66 ea. See my review for more on that."
Mystere,"This is a good show overall but much better in that it allows you to bring kids in. We had our 6 month old with us and she was entertained with the music and the colors.  I think between this and the Beatles Cirque, this is not quite as good.  Beatles is a great one to watch and be sure to get their alcohol filled lemonade smoothie :P"
Mystere,"you probably have already been told by someone to go cirque de soleil, so do it already! Its worth it, its like circus for the modern age. You will prob never see anything ELSE like these cirque de soleil shows. Its like a mix of ballet, trapeze, gymnastics, and just crazy physical feats with spot-on choreography-the ppl in the show are amazing. This particular show is like it suggests a mystery with a mix of comedy-as me and my fiance are still trying to figure out what this show was really about. I think it just was a general theme of human mystery and discovery. Its a more modern type of show with audience interaction and no holds bar on creativity and using the whole theatre as the stage. Some of the costumes were really cool, but some where just weird-same thing with some of the stage props. One of the highlights was *SPOILER ALERT* the guy who comes out in the beginning who u dont know is part of the show at first and is a comedian doing pranks on people-so funny and different."
Mystere,Five star show for an amazing price. Every act was UNBELIEVABLE! Our favorite was the pair (brothers?) who did amazing stunts. Great acts + lots of comedy which was awesome! Every seat in the house is a good one. This was my first cirque show and I left wanting to see ten more! Highly highly recommend!!
Mystere,"Ive seen a number of Cirque shows, this was my first in 1998, and so far this one is the best by far. I think it was the pinnacle of their creation because they had finally matured and perfected their ideas from earlier shows and their roots integrating them into a magical spectacle of performance, costuming, lighting, color and sound (spectacular soundtrack - buy the CD!)! I think many of the shows but not all created after this were to meet a marketing demand and may have the look but not always the heart. 

I prefer to sit anywhere in the front rows of the second tier of seats otherwise you are too close. The musicians and singers are set high up to the right and left of the stage. If you bring a small set of binoculars you can watch the singers in detail to the left and the musicians to the right. I listen to the soundtrack and am still in awe. Aside from seeing O, if you are in Vegas, it can only be a good thing to see this show more than once! 

Circque created an Imax film called Journey of Man also available on DVD which mirrors many of the acts performed in Mystere. In fact it was filmed with much of the cast and in the Nevada desert outside Vegas."
Mystere,"True to the Cirque du Soleil brand, Mystère delivers solid entertainment with plenty of wow factor. The talent of the entertainers is fantastic. Ive seen two other Cirque shows, OVO and Alegría. Mystère ranks just behind OVO for acrobatic talent and humor, and third for costumes and storyline. Dont let third place ranking scare you off - this is a great show in great company. Other reviewers can help you rank it in comparison with current shows in Las Vegas."
Mystere,"My first Cirque show, not my last. We got the buy one get one free with the t.v.deal. We sat right in the middle, which was perfect because so much goes on up above. You dont have to spend a lot to sit up close because mid-theater seats are worthwhile. The employee at the ticket office actually gave me the advice to sit mid-theater for any Cirque show.

Yes, the diaper guy was creepy. And of course, the snail was weird, but the whole show was MYSTERIOUS.  I have a vivid imagination, so I really enjoyed the show."
Mystere,"There hasnt been a Cirque show I havent liked.  We got a great deal on tickets and had wonderful seats.  Entertaining show, always fantastic scenery &amp; costumes.  A great show to catch while in Vegas"
Mystere,"3.5 but since one of the character waved at me and gave me a feather... 4 stars for you, Mystere. 

Maybe the ticket person hyped it up for me, but I had HIGH expectations for this show. He watched over 50 shows, and MYSTERE was #1 on his list. REALLYYYY!??!? 

Perhaps Ive seen a  few Chinese Acrobatic shows before, but the level of difficulty for this Cirque du Soleil was not very high, IMO. However, the story line was funny and cute. A bit slow for me, but overall performance was still above PAR.

Note: You can get discounted tickets at the Flamingo Hotel. I got $80 tickets and sat 4th row."
Mystere,"My first Cirque du Soleil show!

I was quite impressed.  Amazing acrobatics, very entertaining.

I dont think there is a bad seat in the house, though I would recommend against getting seats too close.  Only a minor annoyance, but we were fourth row from the stage and kept having to tilt our head back.  

I did not understand the storyline much, however, it does not take away from the show.  My favorite part was the two brothers, what an incredible display of strength.  

I will back in Vegas and hope to catch another Cirque show, so I probably wont see this show again.  But I would recommend it those who have no seen it.  It is a must-see, cant miss!"
Mystere,The last time I saw this show was about 12 years ago.  I loved it then and I still do!!  It has changed a bit since then.  I think the music was better back then and I loved that an actual person sang throughout the entire show.  A few different acts and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense but the acrobatics are AMAZING!!
Mystere,"We saw the Mystere show and ummmm...maybe Im just not artsy...but we left kind of feeling like, what just happened here? Were we inside of the babys mind? What was up with the old man...the snail? We just didnt get it. It was very beautiful and maybe it wasnt meant to have a plot or story line just meant to be an entertaining visually pleasing show."
Mystere,"I have seen all the Cirque shows in Vegas, and i have seen this one three times since its inception.  It is very good, no question about it.  So if you have not seen any Cirque show, this is a good start."
Mystere,"First at all. This review is regarding their costumer service. That said. If I could Id give negative stars.

My boyfriend and I took a trip to the Grand Canyon + Vegas to celebrate his Birthday, so I bought him his first cirque du Soleil show as his Bday present and we booked a night in the Treasure Island to see the show and enjoy Vegas.
We got in the hotel and rushed to change clothes and go see the show, but when we got there to pick up the tickets and go in I discovered that I bought the tickets for the wrong day, I bought Friday instead of Monday, or something like this. And they wouldnt have a show on the next day.
Their system was having troubles when I got the tickets and I tried several times before actually purchasing it, what I believe helped on my mistake.
I was feeling terrible for mess up with my boyfriend present, and the girl on the reception called her manager to see if she could help us. She could see that i was really surprised about the mistake on the dates.
So we ask the manager what she could do for us and her answer was: The show was not full, she had plenty of space if we wanted to go in, but we would need to pay TWICE the price I paid for.
I bought the tickets for $70 each and she tried to sell me new ones for $150 each (discount price).
We tried to talk to her and explain that was his Bday, ask for a discount since the show was empty, but she didnt even tried to give us a good deal, nor offered us cash back.

Now, I understand that I did a mistake and that was my fault to change the dates. But we paid for the tickets and we travel there mostly to see this show. Since she had an empty show during a week day I honestly believe she could let us see the show or at the very least give us a real discount. Do something for make us feel better. That was F... Vegas after all.
I got super terrible, started crying and feeling like crap for the whole situation. Luckily my bf is super sweet and cheer me up. We went for Señor Frogs, and drink up the situation.
I had a lot of fun but not thanks to Mystere and their terrible costumer service.
On the next day we went on the Bellagio to check the prices of O. When I mention to the seller what happened on Mystere he got me a great deal offering his best seats for $90.
He gave us all the possible discounts he could and made us feel a little better.
He also explained to us that Mystere no longer belonged to cirque du Soleil, and thats probably why the costumer service over there was so bad.
He told me that if was on his show and they had extra tickets they would for sure let us in. We drove back home at midnight after the show, but was worth it. O is impressive!
I took me a long time to write this review, because I hate even think about it. This happened on the end of March.
I am a huge cirque fan and I can tell for this experience that I really wanted to watch this show. I researched a lot and this one looked super cool, but after this experience I got so disappointed that I dont even put Mystere among my choices again. Made me feel bad about Cirque du Soileil in general.
They rather have empty spaces in their show than provide a good service.
I hope that whoever try to see it only will see the show and dont need to treat with their manager."
Mystere,"Amazing!

The theater was wonderful, the concessions reasonably priced, and the show was incredible.

The show had great comedy (both before and during the show), beautiful choreography (even though there is a focal point to every scene, in all directions, something is going on), and incredible physicality (the muscle men who balanced each other was unreal).  The scenes themselves had great artistic design and everything was set to a unique score.

I have nothing less than great things to say.  See it!  Youll enjoy it!"
Mystere,"Cirque Polynesian at the Hyatt in Maui blew this show away. The things they did in that show was amazing. The acts in this show was just plain boring and unimpressive. Majority of the time there were people in weird costumes just prancing around the stage.  It was just bizzaire and I fell asleep after I was done playing words with friends. One of the actor at some point of the show, interacted with the audience and as I looked up I saw him looking down on my phone and shook his head since I was obviously not paying attention. Ha Ha the people around just me laughed.  I guess that happens when you sit in the second row. I would like to add the snail at the end was just weird. It felt their attempt at being abstract just made me lose interest by the second. 

$275 for 2 tickets. Im regretting it now."
Mystere,"To me, Mystère seems to be your classic old school Cirque du Soleil show.  Of the Cirque shows Ive seen so far, this one resembles a circus the most.  The costume and stage design are a little dated, but this in no way takes anything away from the spectacle.  Mystère is simply a lot of fun.  The stunts are breathtaking and the comedic interludes are hilarious.

A note on seating: We were in section 101 row E, which is on the left side when facing the stage.  While it is true that you have to look up for many of the performances, we thoroughly enjoyed our seats.  The segment with the performers on bungee cords was especially thrilling because it seemed like the guy was headed straight for us!  Also, one of the bird-like performers walked through our row."
Mystere,"I LOVE Cirque du Soleil and have seen MANY.... so I definitely feel that I can compare them.  This is one of my favorites!  Thats saying a lot.  Its a down to basics type of Cirque. It doesnt have the crazy moving platform (Ka) or a huge pool (O), but its so magnificent in the individual acts. My favorite part of this show is when the two strong guys get on the small rounded rotating platform.  Its completely amazing how strong, flexible, and basically superhuman they are!  

I have seen this show twice, most recently in April 09.  We had great seats (back of the first section).  I would recommend not sitting too close.  I think the American mindset is closer is better but if you get too close, you spend a lot of time looking straight up and in some instances you are looking behind you.  Sit at the back of the first section from the stage, its perfect.  

In addition... Please please please dont bring your small children to this.  We had a kid (about 2 years old) in front of us and behind us.  One was ok and the other was scared to DEATH and screamed and had to leave numerous times.  I feel like Cirque should have a minimum age, but hey its money.  

I would HIGHLY recommend this show if you are in Las Vegas.  IF you are deciding between this show and another, I would suggest this one.  Its got the core of what Cirque is and because it is an older show you can usually get good seats."
Mystere,"This was not my first Cirque show, nor was it my favorite.  The athleticism of some of the performers were amazing, dont get me wrong.  Some things were unique to other cirque shows and other things were similar and gave you the seen one, seen em all feeling.  What I didnt enjoy was the comedy in the show.  There was some slapstick comedy thrown in, that just wasnt funny.  The most annoying thing was the baby, and the guy throwing popcorn at everyone.  In a way, there is some audience interaction if you are chosen.  

I probably wouldnt see this again and I wouldnt recommend it to a friend.  The theatre is also a lot smaller that I thought it was going to be.  So much so that it really does not matter where you sit.  Every seat in the house is a good seat so dont worry about getting the most expensive of best seats."
Mystere,"I wasnt looking forward to seeing this show at all! Figured it to be some type of chick thing. It was part of If we go here, then we are going here deals. Turned about to be a really great show, I would definitely see it again."
Mystere,"SPECTAULAR!!!!! This show is beyond spectacular! The talent that all of the performers have is BEYOND AMAZING! From the pre-show with Albert Einstein through the entire show, I was intrigued the whole time! There are so many things going on at once in the show! The show is a great length of time, about one hour and fourty minutes. Everything was amazing in this show, I can not even name my favorite five things because it was all just so great! Our seats were fantastic, we sat in the center, third row from the stage!! Mystere is not even expensive and worth every penny your pay for it! Photographers come around before the show and offer to take pictures which you can then purchase after the show. The pictures are pricey but the show was so amazing I spend $105.00 on them! Plus the souvenir shop is so cool! I could watch this show multiple times!!"
Mystere,"After previewing Cirque du Soleils Mystere in one of the greatest Hollywood ad placements of all time (in Knocked Up), I decided that this show is possibly just weird enough for me to enjoy. And it was. Not just weird, but French, too. Nobody does weird quite like the French. 

The story behind the Mystere show is loosely-based on an infants dream about a circus. This premise binds the show together with loose threads of implied narrative, but allows it the freedom to be completely abstract, non-linear, and non-literal. Theres no real dialogue, but theres is a healthy amount of artistry in the costumes, lighting, music, and choreography (although there was sometimes too much happening on stage at once to be visually coherent.) However, the show was above all else, about the movement and athleticism of the performers.

And the athleticism was impressive. We had front-row seats, so we got to see muscles trembling and butt-cheeks clenching in amazing detail. Its like Mary Lou Retton meets Pink Floyds The Wall. Ive never seen anything quite like it.

In a city full of dubious entertainment opportunities, this is something actually worth the money and the time. (I have less kind words for Cirques Zumanity...a juvenile, potty-mouthed cabaret....review forthcoming.)"
Mystere,"I went to Las Vegas last week, and I figured what better way to fill in the after dinner 9PM - 11PM time slot than with a show. Ive already seen pretty much all the big named production shows in Vegas, some shows even multiple times even (Cirque Du Soleils O, Ka, Mystere, Jubilee, Le Reve, Penn &amp; Teller etc). I havent seen Mystere since the late 90s, so I figured Id see it again, reminiscing old times. If I remembered correctly, Mystere had a lot going on everywhere, so in order to get the best view, sitting a little farther back from the stage was better. I bought 2 tickets in section 202 center for about $80 a ticket. Not bad for the seats, and price as the view was excellent, especially since it was right in the center! 

Mystere was made back in 1993 by producer Franco Dragone, with music composed by Benoit Jutras. The same two also teamed up to make O at the Bellagio, and also teamed up to make Le Reve (non-Cirque du Soleil) at the Wynn. 

Having seen O recently, and Mystere almost 10 years ago, I could see Franco Dragones creative touches and influences in Mystere that shows up in a larger scale in O. Mystere is like Franco Dragones baby, and O is like the upgraded version of Mystere with water. Franco Dragone must love large stage lifts, as they are seen in Mystere, and also in O and Le Reve but with the additional water component. (Side Note: Franco Dragone and Benoit Jutras recently made House of Dancing Waters in Macao, which from the previews seems like a combination of the best components of O and Le Reve. These two are amazing!). 

I have to mention, the composer Benoit Jutras is a genius. There is nothing like a Cirque du Soleil show with music that we have no clue what they are saying. The music really adds to the shows. As mentioned above, Benoit Jutras made the music for Mystere, O, and Le Reve, in which I love the music for all 3 shows. 

Id say if youve already seen O or Le Reve or Ka, you might have to think twice about seeing Mystere. If you really like the circus/acrobatics aspect without the flashy stages, Mystere Id say has the best acrobatics/circus aspect than O, Ka, or even Le Reve. All the performers in Mystere make it look so easy. If your more into the large stages, then Mystere might be a disappointment. Although considering Mystere was made in 1993, the stage still seems amazing even for todays standards for me. I definitely had a good time, and I was entertained for the full 90 minutes. 

Maybe its because I saw the 9:30PM show, but I was disappointed to see that a lot of seats were empty, especially on the sides."
Mystere,Unbelievable show. I saw it up close in the second row and Id love to see it again from farther back just for a new perspective.  So much to see I didnt know where to look on stage at any one time. Definitely worth the money.  I got half priced tickets from a discount ticket stand. Go see it!
Mystere,"So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics! However, I believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer!!! 

I loved the show! The performers are amazing!! &amp; it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats!"
Mystere,Awesome I have to say. My husband and I saw this in March 2013. Loved the baby carriage in the beginning and once the baby came out and started the comedy acts they were messing with a guy in my area as being his Papa!! hilarious.. The décor was beautiful. The costumes were amazing as well as the story line. I loved the guy in the aerial square. So amazing.
Mystere,"Ive been to see O and another show in Reno that were very similar to this. This show was pretty entertaining for the most part but once youve seen O, I think nothing else compares.  It had some humor with audience participation and held my attention throughout the night.  Show was very past paced which I liked.  No accidents or falls to report.  Lots of music and amazing acrobatic acts.  Good for families with young kids. Our seats were not in the very front but more in the middle so it was perfect.  There was a very long line getting in so you can wait until the line dies down to start walking towards the theater.  The show starts right on time.  We got a good deal on our tickets through Travelzoo.  Would definitely like to see more Cirque shows in the future but cant decide which one."
Mystere,Not the best Cirque du Soleil but it was ok.  Nothing that made me want to rant about. There was a comedian during the intermissions and he was hella funny! I love the production and costumes and the crowd interaction.  You have to be open minded. Some will say there is no storyline and some will. I say just go and enjoy it you might like it but for me it was just ok.  There were a couple acts that was a little unconfrontable to watch because we were in the 2 nd row and would have to look up and my neck starting cramping.
Mystere,"A good show at a great price when compared to other cirque du soleil shows. This show is dated though. The theater is never more than 80% full. If one can get a discount on this show, go. If not, dont spend more than $50 per ticket."
Mystere,"This week was my second time watching Mystere.  The first time I watched the show was back in Oct 2007.  My bf and I decided to watch this show again because our reservations for KA was lost.  

Mystere was awesome.  My bf enjoyed it very much....the opening act and how the joker guy came out during the show was sooo funny.  This was a very good show for first timers because it just makes them leave wanting to watch more Cirque du Soleil.....(well it made my bf a fan anyways).  As a second timer watching the show....i loved and enjoyed every bit of it again.  

We cant wait for our next cirque du soleil!

Helpful tip....Make sure the people you sit next to arent very drunk....or you may just get a surprise from them....(a couple rows behind us, a few guys were so drunk they puked all over their row....so nasty)"
Mystere,"What a mystifying performance at the Treasure Island. This was my first exposure to any Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas, and I really enjoyed it! I was amazed how strong and precise some of the performers were. I didnt even know it was possible for a human being to do such things. It was basically an acrobatic performance using vibrant colors with amazing body manipulation.

*Tip - Get a few margaritas at the tiki bar outside next to the theater. You will definitely enjoy the show more!"
Mystere,This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show and it was a great experience! The acrobatics were so impressive! And I was surprised at how funny some of the performances were. Great deal considering how cheap the tickets are!
Mystere,"This is it. This is the show that helped spawn my love for all things Cirque. I didnt even know what Cirque was until my father and mother took my brother and I to this show a long time ago in Las Vegas.

I entered those doors with an open mind and I left those doors completely blown away. This show, and all shows that come from Cirque are the embodiment of artistic perfection. These shows seamlessly blend music, comedy, story telling, acrobatics and imagination.

Seeing these performers jump from pole to pole with thundering drums in the background is something Ill never forget. Ive seen this show maybe four times and it never gets old.

If it wasnt for Ka, this would be my favorite show in Las Vegas. I honestly havent seen Le Reve, but I heard that one is almost as good and some people even tell me that its better."
Mystere,"I thought this show was ok, I wouldnt go see it again. They had a lot of fantasy settings, There was a lot going on in this show. I feel it has no real organization from one act to another. The costumes were creative. one consistant charecter was the funniest."
Mystere,"Great show...dont want to give away anything but only received 4 stars because they allowed children in the theater.  The parents could not man their children and they not only kicked the back of my chair the entire show, I went to complain midway through and management did NOTHING about it.  Also, the kid kept talking and asking questions about whats next, why do they do this, why do they do that? and the parents did NOTHING to shut the kid up.  Sorry but when I pay over $100 per ticket (this was years ago), Im paying for good entertainment.  If i wanted circus circus, I would have just went there instead.  

I look forward to seeing more cirque shows!"
Mystere,"Not a great show.  It seems as though it was thrown together last minute, but I found out it is one of the oldest Cirque shows on the strip.  Ooops.

Acrobats were ok...story is strange.  I think the snail grows throughout and the big fat baby represents the selfishness and gluttony of man....yadda yadda yadda.  Hey Mystere people....we are in Vegas.  I can go outside the theater and spend $10,000 at the slot machine and then gorge at a buffett.  Vegas is the epitome of selfishness and gluttony.  It would be like a priest camping out at an Adult Movie store.  Father...youre doing it wrong.

But I digress.  The show was strange.  Did not flow like most Cirque shows.  And there was a female acrobat dressed like a bird and chirped like a bird.  The chirp was a bit annoying.  You cannot beat the price...perhaps the cheapest of all Cirque shows, and you get what you pay for.  Overall it is a decent time killer, but I wouldnt recommend attending."
Mystere,wasnt willing to spend an arm and a leg to watch this show but my family and I were lucky enough to get discounted tix by purchasing the night of the show directly w the box office. I dont think theres such a thing as a bad seat for this for as there is something for the eye to see at EVERY angle. I was a bit overwhelmed at first and there was so much going on at once but overall this show was good. this cirque is geared towards a more family-oriented crowd compared got the other cirques. the stunts had me at the edge of my seat an the visuals were great
Mystere,"I have seen this show several times and have a special affection for it for some reason.   I think this show and Ovo are the best Cirque shows.  Not sure why they dont have Ovo in Vegas.  It would mix it up a bit.  

Anyway...  very entertaining!  Seen it 4 times.  If you book it, try the steakhouse at TI.  It is a fantastic combo!"
Mystere,"We had a wonderful time! I saw this show 4 years ago and loved it as much this time as I did back then. Absolutely stunning! Would watch this again and again! This is a good show to start with if youve never seen a cirque show before. Its very whimsical! Im looking forward to the next time were in Vegas so we can see KA, or O."
Mystere,This show was amazing!  I loved the storyline along with the humor. The acrobatics along with the special effects were spectacular!  I would definitely see it again in a heartbeat!
Mystere,Greatest show Ive ever seen! Flawless acrobatics and great comedy. Everyone should see this show! So amazing! Just be warned the comedian may pick you out of the audience... Just play along
Mystere,"Not bad. I did not really get the story line, but it was cool to see the diff costumes and acrobatics.  Also we sat on the fourth row and had to lean back to see the performers up high. Some of the costumes were freaky looking. lol"
Mystere,"Great show. Well worth the cost of admission. Arrive early. You dont want to miss the pre-show. A vagrant old man pretending to be an usher goes up to entrants, takes their tickets and leads them to their seats. Unfortunately, the old man cant quite figure out where the seats are and leads the unwitting people around the auditorium as a spotlight follows them stumbling over already seated people. Finally, in frustration, the old man throws the tickets in the air, leaving his followers to fend for themselves. In another bit, the old man takes tubs of popcorn and showers the audience. When the actual show is about to start, the stage manager runs the old man off. On the evening we attended, the old man hadnt tossed all the popcorn, so an usher handed my wife and me one of the unused tubs.

The actual show is mesmerizing. Its full of tumblers, contortionists, jugglers and aerial artists doing amazing stunts. Youll be enthralled."
Mystere,"Disappointing through and through.  Maybe my expectation was too high since the person who sold me the ticket said he has seen 53 shows in Vegas and Mystere was his favorite.  LIESSS!

I like the whimsical concept of Mystere but the acts were not up to par for a Cique du Soleil show imo.  Nothing exciting, nothing new that I havent seen before.  Some of the costumes could be better designed.  The in-between-shows-time-fillers were especially disappointing, it wasnt that funny."
Mystere,"Definitely not as good as Ka or O, but not a bad show to watch in Las Vegas.

Dont get me wrong, the acrobatics were very impressive. However, the show as a whole was kind of slow... (My mom fell asleep a bunch of times). Also, the little acts between the shows were long, and useless (in my opinion).

Anyways, if you are watching a Cirque du Soleil show for the first time, you will be impressed by Mystere. However, if you have seen other shows, I would skip this show and watch something else instead."
Mystere,My wife saw O and raved about it. This was our first time to Vegas together so we thought it would be fun to see Mystere together but we both thought it was good but not great. She still thinks O was much better and this hardly compared.
Mystere,"Okay, I have been to about 7 different Cirque du Soleil and this is by far and away the weakest of the 7.  

We had great seats -- 10 rows from the center.  The acrobats were okay (I have seen better -- aka O and La Nouba).  The clowns were not funny at all.  Like the other reviews, after a period of time, it did get a bit annoying.  As for the story and display, I thought it was a bit too confusing.  There was too much going-on on the stage.  It makes you sort of lose focus.  

As a result, I find myself kinda getting bored with the show.  After spending this much money for 2 tickets, I discovered that I was checking my watch every 10 minutes wondering how much longer until this is over.  With the snail ending (no pun intended --- for viewers who have seen this, they can understand the snail analogy), it brought the show to an unfulfilling end.  Amen!

If you like to spend good money on a Cirque du Soleil show or something similiar in vegas, I would recommend instead O or Le Reve.

Thanks"
Mystere,Great show!  We got some nice seats and enjoyed a very acrobatic show.  Theres a lot of audience involvement from prior to the show as well as during.  Entertaining clown and BIG baby as well as very colorful costumes and truly flexible/strong people.  Glad we got to see this while in Vegas.
Mystere,"Meh.

That about explains it the most.  Its Cirque, it is going to be amazing acrobats doing amazing things.  What sets a decent, good and great Cirque show apart is how well it is tied together and the running characters. This one was a bit more or just a series of acts that were very poorly tied together and some pretty bad transitions between the two.

It is supposed to be whimsical and seen though the eyes of the child, but I just really didnt get that theme across as much as they should.  When one set of acrobats would end, there might be some little transition where you can see people on stage moving things around preparing for the next group.

Everything done was impressive and amazing, there just wasnt much tying it together.  At times I was actually finding myself a bit bored during some of the bits of the show.  Or looking off into other directions where you see them getting ready for the next act.


If you like the acrobatics and nothing else, you will NOT be disappointed.  But if you have seen Cirque and seen a show with multiple facets and things going on with an actual story tying it together, then you can do better with other shows.

While talking about it, there is also the place the show is in.  The theater at TI, which is a pretty old venue.  This is a classic theater with nothing but theater seating. Zumaity had couches and seats for couples, others have had the tables and waitress service.  This is just a run of the mill theater with tons of seating.  Not too comfortable, not at all romantic.  (Cant even raise the arm rests to cuddle).  The formality of it all just makes the act and acrobats seem more distance and almost movie like. TI really should put some effort into updating the theater."
Mystere,Fantastic! Better than Totem but not as good as Kooza.
Mystere,Great acrobatics. The baby act wasnt really funny and not sure why its part of the gig.
Mystere,"Loved this show!  It was our first Cirque du Soleil show and we were blown away. I plan on seeing more over the next few years.  All seats in this theatre are good seats, like any Cirque du Soleil shows I think it is better to sit not in the first section so you can see all the action without straining your neck!  I would definitely see this show again"
Mystere,"As my first Cirque du Soleil show, I was very entertained but I expected more. Since I have no other Cirque du Soleil show to compare it to, I cant really say anything negative.

I was amazed by the performers and their abilities and found myself ooooo-ing and aaaahh-ing many times. My parents bought the tickets so Im not sure how much it was--but I know that this show is cheaper than the others."
Mystere,What a great time. Have seen four other shows but this is the first one at a Las Vegas venue.  Theater is beautiful and seating looks good from anywhere. The orchestra sounded  superb as well as the singers. All the good stuff expected from a Cirque show. Have to place this one near the top in comparison of others.  Awesome.
Mystere,"Great show.  I would say it fits right between the two Cirque du Soleils Ive already seen.  O being the best and Kooza the lower of the three.

Great combo of acrobatic performances as well as comedic clown moments.  My favorite act was the trampoline one, very cool.  Not much to say as I dont want to spoil any visits here but Id definitely recommend seeing this show."
Mystere,"This is my second time seeing Mystere.  I had seen it before I met my husband and I know his Cirque taste, so I figured he would like this one.  You forget a lot, it was almost like my first time seeing it.  Like most cirque shows, the storyine is hard to follow, if there is one.  Go see Lion King if you need something you can understand.  You go to admire to acrobatics, which I think a lot of people dont understand how hard it is, especially when they make it look so effortless executed to perfection.  This is a classic cirque show that doesnt rely on Elvis. the Beatles, or water.

Do look around for deals.  If you are staying at TI you can get two for one, or go direct to the website.  We got 2 for $100.  Not bad."
Mystere,"This was a fairly stupid show, Thinking of acrobatics and entertainment... I didnt want to see anything with an obese man with a diaper and someone spilling sparkling apple juice on me for comic relief - really LAME! I wanted to be wowed differently, like Wow - that was really fun...

Already boarded a plane and flew to Vegas to see it, cant  fully regret- so I guess thats reason to be thankful since I got out of the cold but - But NO Thanks Mystere ! D-i-s-s-a-p-o-i-n-t-i-n-g....YIKES!"
Mystere,"I wish I could give this show 3.5 star since I like KA more but dont want to degrade from this show either. If you are a tourist and plan to see only 1 Cirque show you need to see the original. It does not have a plot or a storyline but, it is still visually amazing. The arena that this is held in is a perfect size and has a great view from everywhere. I actually sat front row and it was a little too close. It is fun to watch Knocked Up before you watch this too and maybe get some ideas."
Mystere,"Generally, I like Cirque.  Seeing Kooza when it was touring was the highlight of that summer.  That said, Mystere was disappointing.

Too Vegas-sy.  They have to cram two shows a night into the auditorium, which makes it shorter than your normal Cirque show.  Add in a way-too-persistent comedy act of an annoying baby ,and the wow-factor is pretty low.

Cirque probably knows this; thats why its the cheapest of the Vegas shows.  But Id say skip this one, and splurge on Ka or O."
Mystere,"My first Cirque show in Vegas, and it was very good.  Took my girls, and they were astonished by the many awesome performances.  Seemed a bit disconnected with no real story line (what was the Big Babys purpose in the show? Kids liked him, but seemed kind if creepy to me!), but the performers were very good.  Overall, happy with the show."
Mystere,"Went to this show with my wife and was hoping to see something spectacular. Well I wasnt disappointed but I also was not blown away. I think this show is about average and good for kids. Dont get me wrong, they do a lot of acrobatic tricks and the two guys showing strength and balance. But after seeing Ka this show doesnt measure up. It does have some comedy thrown in there and the colors make you feel like your on acid. Maybe that would make it more enjoyable but I wouldnt know since I dont do that stuff. Oh and as much as I payed attention I couldnt follow the story line if there was one (not sure). My wife couldnt follow either so its not just me. So dont take my word for it, the show is not too expensive but remember you get what you pay for, at least most of the time."
Mystere,"What an incredible show! A great mix of comedy, dancing, music and acrobatics. Great audience participation. These performers are simply brilliant. I have never said holy crap so many times watching a performance. You will be completely entertained. The show is fantastic!!!"
Mystere,"This is my third Cirque show and it fits in as my second favorite. I wish I could understand the story line, there seemed to be some narrating in French.  They had a weird baby character that poped up throughout the show, she didnt really perform (besides a couple flips on a trampoline) but seemed to be an intrical part of the storyline in the show. 

The colors and costumes were beautiful- vibrant. The acts were amazing!  Two muscle guys who do an acrobatic act with thier bodies was my favorite, they were awesome, like human rubberbands.  Some performers throughout the show were obviously stronger than others, Cirque O does a better job of hiding weaker performers. The O show is my favorite so far. I was still thoroughly entertained watching Mystere. This show has a real circus feel to it.  Fun and well worth the money."
Mystere,"This was my and my husbands first Cirque show so I cant compare much, but I have been to see other shows similar and I loved it!!

The venue was perfect because it didnt seem like there was a bad seat at all. 

The show was incredibly visually stunning. The whole feel of the show was very true to the concept. Although at times there was so much to look at that I felt like if my husband and I didnt point out little things to each other we might have missed them. I didnt understand the comedy at the intervals as much but I understand that it was to make time for the performers. I was intrigued from start to finish and we cant wait to check out the other shows that Cirque has to offer."
Mystere,"They call it Mystère because the point of the story is a mystery. Its a mix of most random stuff put together that makes no sense. Ive seen several Cirque productions all in the temporary tent settings. Those productions have been much better than this one at Treasure Island.

One star ding for lack of coherent story.

Another star ding for lack of amazing circus stunts. Make me want to clap... not because I have to do for your uninspired circus stunts.

For the cost, it is a fair value, but I felt a little gyped after leaving the show."
Mystere,I went to the show July 8 and had a great time.  This was my first time seeing a cirque du soleil show and boy was it amazing.  The seating and venue was very comfortable and family friendly.  I enjoyed it all!
Mystere,"I should probably be fired for falling asleep during a Cirque du Soleil show and this was my first Cirque du Soleil experience.  Im assuming I fell asleep because during the day I had one of those yard sticks..

On a lighter note, I did watch most of it.  It was really amazing.  I couldnt believe how agile these people were.  They were like monkeys, but real people.  They jumped from pole to pole.  They stretched like rubber bands.  They balanced a huge metal 3d outline of a box with their feet!!!  I cant even explain it.

Next time I watch a Cirque du Soleil show, Ill drink coffee and not a yard stick margarita :) 

P.S.
I got caught taking pictures twice!  They took away my camera and then my phone.  After the show I had to pick it up and they MADE me delete every single picture.  They even watched me to make sure.  They asked me to scroll left and right to make sure I deleted every single photo and video that I took.  Be a lot more slick if youre willing to take that risk."
Mystere,"Mystere was my first Cirque du Soleil EVER. Im not sure how much my opinion of Mystere will change if I watch it now that Ive seen 6 others. I will say one thing, though - there is no such thing as a bad Cirque du Soleil. Every single performer is beauty in motion.

To appreciate the history and see how the different productions have progressed with time as well as the incorporation of special effects and elaborate stages, its a very good idea to start with one of the simpler first resident Cirques in Las Vegas - Mystere. It may not be as refined as the newer productions (keep in  mind that Mystere was first performed in 1993) and a lot of the time, can be rather confusing.. but once again you can expect a consistency with all Cirque du Soleils with its incredible acrobats in all the acts.

__________________________________________

If I could do it all over again, Id save the best for last and do it in the following order: 1.) Zumanity, 2.) Mystere 3.) Love, 4.) Ka, 5.) Le Reve, 6.) O - Havent seen Elvis or Believe, but Id bet theyd go well either before/after Love."
Mystere,"Took advantage of a great military discount for last minute tickets to Mystere, and we are so glad we took a chance and saw this show! The acrobats were amazing and the show went at a good pace. I will say that the storyline is a little strange and difficult to understand, but I knew going in that it was supposed to be about a childs first recollections (or something like that) so it was a little easier to pick up on. Honestly though, the real attraction is the performers, and you dont need alot of plot to enjoy their performances. The weirdness did not detract from the show itself at all! 

Our tickets were pretty far back, but in the middle of the theater, which I think is nicer because you dont have to tilt your head back to see everything. Also, the high price ticket holders get treated to a little pre show fun at their expense, its totally harmless but most likely slightly annoying to someone that paid a ton for their ticket. Overall a great show, highly recommended for a first time Vegas goer like me!"
Mystere,"This was the first Cirque du Soleil show ive seen, and I wasnt sure what to expect. It was amazing. The music and acrobats were fantastic. There was a lot of humour, which I didnt expect, but it was a pleasant surprise. It was a little weird and not much of a storyline, but kept me entertained the entire time. Definitely would see another show again."
Mystere,"Great acrobatics, but weird story.  It is worth seeing once, not sure I would go back unless I score a locals deal."
Mystere,"This was an awesome show and worth the money in my opinion.

The theatre is a large stadium style seating. The stage itself is very nice and well done. Lots of lighting and the music was really good.

If you arrive early, they have a little audience interaction with one of the characters. He appears to be an old man, dressed in a tuxedo, there for more of the comedic effect and interacting with the audience. He also appears throughout the show.

The big baby throughout the show is also entertaining.

The acts itself were really done well. Some of them can be repetitive though. I found myself falling asleep to one of the acts because it was repetitive and the music they had on was very mellow."
Mystere,"You can view the entire show from any seat in the theatre (and take note, this is a small theatre, so every seat is good) But the best place to be is CENTER, and MIDDLE distance from the stage. I sat toward the side of the stage, and I did miss a few things that I would have been able to see if I was sitting center.

**Be warned, if you sit up in the VERY front, you may be embarrassed/asked to come on stage and do things. There were also some victims that werent SO close to the stage, but in the section closest to the front."
Mystere,"HOLY CRAP. 

OH MY GOD!

AMAZING.

ARE YOU SERIOUS???

WOW.

These were some of the most frequent phrases I continuously repeated to myself during this show. There were some parts when I honestly couldnt believe what I was seeing. Was it a dream??? I dunno, but thats what it felt like!

What these people can do is absolutely amazing and stupifying. At one point I turned to my fiance, Will, and said, CYBORGS. These things are CYBORGS.

Luckily, we had front row seats, which made the experience even more amazing. People, er, Cyborgs were flying over my head, doing flips on the platform 2 feet from my face. Astonishing! 

AND out of the 1,000+ or so people in the audience, Will got chosen out of the crowd to be a part of the act. 15 minutes of fame!

HIL-AR-I-OUS."
Mystere,"So many people I know cite this Cirque as their favorite. I would say that this is my favorite Cirque-y one if that makes sense. All the things you see on TV are done in this show. It is really amazing. These shows are expensive for a reason, they are amazing. 
The theatre is older than Ka or Zumanity , so there are some seats in the house that are not as good. I reccomend for this show getting some decent seats. Go see Mystere, it has been showing five days a week for ten years for a reason! 
Sometimes in slower times of the year they have the locals discount, I would call the box office and just ask for it at least, no harm in that!"
Mystere,"This show is pretty great!  As with all Cirque shows, I usually have no idea whats going on, but I like what Im watching.  They have some amazing gymnasts and parts of the show are quite amusing: theres a magician and an odd adult-baby.  Overall, its an awesome show to go see.  (Better than Ka, in my opinion)"
Mystere,"It was just good....certainly better than KA.  This show would be fantastic if this was your 1st Cirque show or you saw it 10 years ago.  After watching O, KA and Zumanity, you can kind of see how the creators have built upon the acts in Mystere and improved them.  Fortunately we took advantage of the locals discount to see it.  A lot of locals feel like this show is better than O but I wholeheartedly disagree."
Mystere,"I think if I saw this when it first came out I would have been dazzled, but Ive just seen way too much Cirque since its opening (24 productions and Ive seen 14). I will however agree that to consider this as the first Cirque here and how its been a mainstay, its good....its been here for 17 years already! It was their first permanent show, and though good- they have just gotten better from here after perfecting a stage show and getting bigger budgets and new technology.

I thought the costuming was nice and this was more to the traditional style of Cirque, more like the traveling shows, before their Vegas productions got bigger and more complicated. The baby clown was alright but some of it was a bit overkill (MAMAA X 30 times). Oh and I kept getting people asking whats up with the snail? So this is about the mystery of life and life cycle hence the baby and the insects and all that....the snail was also growing, youll see little snail pass by in different scenes until it was all grown up in the end hence culminating in its adulthood.  

It made for a nice Christmas. We got tickets with a December locals discount so it was good value for what we paid, but I dont think Id repeat this one."
Mystere,"BEST SHOW EVER. 

*clapping* *clapping*

The TI Theater is kinda big. My seats were Section 101 row B, which was located in the side of the stage. I know the middle section would have been the best view for the show but surprise my seats werent even that bad. i saw everything clearly and some of the acrobats came up to us really close so i saw their costumes and makeup. 

I love it! the masks are kinda creepy but DAMN the acrobats and dancers are SOOOO fit and flexible. The first part of the show there is a man who tricks the audience and pokes fun at people which i thought was pretty funny. 

Its JUST AMAZING!

MUST WATCH! VERY ENTERTAINING. 

Now, i really want to watch Beatles Love."
Mystere,"Spectacular. 

This is one of the best shows on the strip. What makes this show even better? There are discounts available for this show so take advantage of them while you can!!!

Good: Spectacular show with discounts readily available.

Bad: Some seats can be really bad in this show so choose carefully.

Final: Go watch it!"
Mystere,"Went here on the first night of a week-long sales conference with part of my new extended team.  Someone in the original group couldnt go so they asked me and I jumped at the chance.  Ive only seen a handful of shows in Vegas so I was excited to see this one.  It shows at TI (Treasure Island) which gives you a sense of its place in the hierarchy of Cirque shows.  Its better than the traveling Kooza in most ways, but not as good as O.

The show is pretty funny.  Yes there are definitely parts where it is breathtaking and spectacular, but what strikes me the most are the funny parts.  Its not even just a 30-second way to transition between scenes.  There are full-on 5-7 minute skits where its that big baby or the crazy emcee.  Funny yes, but they completely break up the flow of a show without a lot of flow to begin with.  Where Le Reve was simply visually stunning at times, Mystere has some really trippy parts where I just have to sit back and shake my head a few times.  Nothing lewd or incendiary, but its somewhat surreal to be watching.

As for the acts, some where astonishing, but I actually feel like Kooza (even in the smaller stage and area in the AT&amp;T Park parking lot in SF had more astounding physical acts.  We sat slightly off center stage and about 6 rows back, so we had a very good view of the stage and everything around us.  There is more crowd interaction than a lot of shows, particularly Le Reve and Kooza.  They brought at least 2 people on stage and interacted directly with about 8 people in the audience.

Very good show.  Unless youre a hardcore O fan, you will definitely enjoy this."
Mystere,"I got a pair of tickets for the bfs Christmas gift. I think I paid too much for them but thats okay. He said he enjoyed it and I sure did too. We got awesome seats!! Make sure to sit in the upper section. You might think that sitting in the lower section is better but there are two reasons why it isnt...

1. You WILL get harassed by the actors.
2. You dont get to see the whole show. Stunts are way up high too!

Keep your eyes peeled because its way easy to miss something. Everyone says that O is a better show by far but I have to disagree and think that Mystere might be a tad bit better. Mystere was funnier, had more of a story line, and the stunts wowed me more. I will say that O is definitely artsier and has more of an effect on the crowd because everything done is revolved around agua. 

I keep hearing that if you stay at the MIrage or TI, you get a buy 1 get 1 free deal and if you have an MGM Players Card, you can also score some sweet deals on tickets. Make sure to do your research before hand because I will the next time I decide to catch a Cirque du Soleil show!"
Mystere,"As a fan of Cirque shows, I was very pleased with Mystere.
The fat baby, the homo-erotic balancing act, and those pole-climbers were the show stealers for me.
oh, and that guy who was doing the cube twirling (hed be awesome at a rave! haha!!).

What i did NOT like was that pre-show jerk who was throwing pop-corn on people. While the majority of the audience was laughing in hysterics, I thought it was pretty rude and it got old after the first 5 minutes.

This is my only complaint about the show. Other than that, I would definitely see it again. 
 I am always left in wonder and amazement after Cirque du Soliel. And how cute were those teeny-sized dancers? 

xo-
andrea"
Mystere,"this show gave me anxiety, but in a good way due to their jaw dropping stunts and insane displays of body control. HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

I appreciated the fact that they incorporated the audience so if you dont like being in the spotlight, DONT SIT IN THE FRONT."
Mystere,"Solid Cirque show.  Love the acrobats, costumes, and the funny opening skit.  I hear O is better, but this was quite entertaining."
Mystere,This is circus in the 21st Century: an atmospheric visual orgasm with a distinctively surreal french feel.  Its really spectacular.
Mystere,My parents enjoyed the show. This was not my favorite cirque du soleil show I have seen but I didnt hate it...O  is still my favorite.
Mystere,"Fantastic! To give you an idea of how extraordinary the performers really are, I was shocked to see real human faces under the masks and makeup at the end of the show. Two thumbs up!"
Mystere,"This show was so amazing. The customer service people who sold me the tickets were nice. Unfortunately, I tried to cancel, and there are no refunds, so I decided to go watch it anyways. I am very glad that I did. The show was so remarkable, it brought me back to days when I was a child and went to the circus. My seats werent that great as they were on the side. Make sure you get a frontal view, but not too close to the stage or else they will grab you and make you apart of the show."
Mystere,"The show is worth every cent, I personally go to see all there shows no matter where they perform. It is definitely 5 stars!"
Mystere,"First off, I have seen four other shows so far, so I am trying to keep my bias tailored to each show individually.

The show was a great show and getting the 50% discount for military makes it even better. We got $80 tickets for about $40 each. The atmosphere in the theater a little more janky than some of the other venues I have seen previously. There is not a bad show in the house, so getting the cheapest tickets is what i recommend. You sit in a half circle and the cheaper your tickets the closer you are to the stage. 

The performers are all very talented. That being said, it is hard for me not to tell you to go see other shows as of all the Cirque shows I have seen, this is my least favorite. I felt like I was continuously waiting for something great to happen.

1. Cheesy acting. There are a group of actors that are part of the show that add humor to the show. They do a great job but I feel it really slowed down the show and didnt fit in with the calibur of a Cirque show.

2. Repetitive acts. It seemed as if the acts were drawn out to take up time/space. Dont get me wrong, there are some really good acts, but it seemed like you got your fix on each act and were ready to see something else much faster than they actually performed.

Other than that, the show was decent. Looking forward to seeing the last few Cirque shows while I am stationed here.

Seating and view = 5
Atmosphere and setting = 3
TIcket pricing = 4
Performers = 3
Other = 3"
Mystere,"I have to admit, I havent seen too many Cirque shows, but if I had to use one word to describe Mystere it would be DISAPPOINTING!  There was absolutely no story line and the only entertainment was the acrobatics.  Granted, if you see any Cirque show you are going to see some amazing acrobatics, but I really dont think there was anything you couldnt see at a Ringling Brothers show at half the price.  The only ones in the audience laughing at the clowns were the 10 year olds a few rows in front of us.  A few years ago I saw Ka at MGM and was amazed.  The story had me involved, the stunts and acrobatics had my heart racing.  It was everything I would expect from a Cirque show and more.  Mystere, not so much.  I would not recommend spending the money."
Mystere,"No Spoiler Alerts Neccessary-

Wow. So many bright lights. So many performers everywhere - front, back and above. I was entertained throughout the whole performance. Even the act with the fat adult baby were hilarious as the other performers got ready for the next act."
Mystere,"As my first Cirque du Soleil show. It was kind of disappointing. 

The show really needed a storyline. Annoying baby and a wondering snail just doesnt due it. 

I kept asking everyone else if their other shows were like this. The others are better. Pay the extra money."
Mystere,"Awesome show.  Not a bad seat in the house.  The photographers that come around are a bit annoying and the pose he asked me and my friend to do alone was from the 80s.  However, this show is full of amazing acts and unbelievable talent.  This was my first cirque show and I will be returning to see others!!! Definitely a good first timer show."
Mystere,"3.5 

I had high hopes for a Vegas Cirque show, but it delivered just short of what I expected. Since I have only seen one other Cirque performance, which happened to be their traveling show Kooza, I was imagining at least 5xs the excitement at a permanent show. 

It was a last minute decision to watch Mystere and we got tickets for around $85. We probably had the worst seating in the theater which wasnt bad at all. I found that Mystere had about the same amount of acts as Kooza. 

Pros: The acts were still amazing as expected. The costumes and and makeup were very creative and lively. The staging had different elements that the traveling show lacked. I absolutely loved the music.

Cons: I found that the comedic relief wasnt as funny as the Koozas. And I basically found Kooza and Mystere at a pretty dead even race as to which was more entertaining. 

Overall: Still a pretty good show, but I just left wanting more.  Perhaps it was because I had seen Kooza before hand and was using that to compare. I would say if it is your first Cirque show, you should still watch it! But not if youve seen Kooza or any other performances."
Mystere,"i dont want to spoil the show like other reviews...so if you want to know about what happens read other review.  I am only going to review my experience.

so far i have not found a cirque show i have not loved.  but this one...has fallen a tad short from the others.  I am not saying its a bad show in any way...but i feel other cirque shows are just...more.  

this would be a very good 1st cirque show to watch.  any one after will just get better and better.

for this one try to get your sets center and a little further back.  row 10 or so should be good.  the theater is a bit on the smaller side so i dont think their really is a bad seat in the house.  a lot does go on the stage and if you are off to the side...you may miss something.  and if you are too close you will have a tweaked neck from staring up for all the high up air performances."
Mystere,I love Cirque shows huge fan. Everytime i go to vegas i always see a cirque show. Now i like Zumanity better than this one. but it was still amazing. This is only our second one but well worth it
Mystere,"I had no F-ing idea what this show was about but I loved it anyway.  The show was super trippy with all the lights and stuff.  Brian Le Petit (the guy in the suit) was hilarious!  He kept messing with the audience.  Definitely lots of audience interaction so be prepared to get pulled on stage/be put on the spotlight if you sit in the front.

My boyfriend and I got tickets in Section 203, Row LL, Seats 5-6.  They were smack in the center of the stage in the back.  I thought they were pretty awesome seats.  I definitely recommend sitting toward the back in the orchestra so you can see everything because there is SO MUCH going on.

Very entertaining show =D"
Mystere,"Very entertaining show, although something of a mystery as to why a giant baby reoccurs throughout the show. Outstanding acrobatics and strength and grace are amazing."
Mystere,"I strongly recommend Mystere by Cirque du Soleil for kids. My five year old laughed and yelled in surprise throughout the hour and a half.  Ribbon act, feats of strength, wild trampolining and bouncy seesaws, a very frenetic intro to more linear Cirque shows.  Le Reve is better for adults, as the transitional story pieces in Mystere, while they set up the next gymnastics act, is brain-killing."
Mystere,"Sit in Cat 2 when you go. It is side seating FYI but there are some benefits. 
1) When the acrobatics are in the center, you can lounge back, the seats recline a little bit and see the formation of a star. Its incredible. 
2) Easy to get in and out
3) There arent as many seats in this Cat and none of them are bad.

Tips:
There is a clown who looks like an usher. Looks like a bad englishmen, if you want to walk all over the place and have people laugh at you, talk to him. :)
Dont get there too early. Mystere is in the back of T.I where KahunaVille is. It gets uber crowded quick. (I hate lines)
For those who drink, go for it. It makes it all so much more magical. :)
If youve never seen a Cirque Show, this should be youre first.
Also there are many ways to get a discount to this show!"
Mystere,"You should take this review with a grain of salt if youve seen Cirque du Soleil and know that you like it, since this isnt a review of this particular show so much as it is a comment on Cirque in general.  I know some people are huuuuge fans but I really just dont connect with it for whatever reason.  My friend and I saw this show on a Vegas trip back in 2008.   I dont remember what we paid per ticket but I think it was around $100 (I remember it was WAY more than I should have paid as a poor student).   The acrobats are definitely impressive, but theres not a lot to it other than that, and I found that watching the stunts gets old very fast, since they are all pretty similar.    I mostly alternated between being really creeped out by the giant baby bouncing the ball around and bored by the lack of action on stage.  I found it incredibly repetitive and didnt really enjoy watching it for 1-2 hours, or whatever it was.   Also, I saw a video of this show in a modern dance class in high school (over 10 years ago), parts of the show in the movie Knocked Up (yup, its the same one that Paul Rudd &amp; Seth Rogen get so freaked out by when theyre on shrooms), and then the whole show in Vegas and it seemed exactly the same all three times.    

I will say that when they confiscated my camera for taking pictures (even though I didnt use flash) they were really nice and only deleted the ones from the show.  It would have been much easier for them to just hit the delete all button, Im sure, but I hadnt uploaded any of my Vegas pics yet, so I was super relieved and grateful that they took the time to delete only the offending photos.    Also for what its worth, I agree that there are no really bad seats in the house - we had the cheapest and they were pretty far off to the side, but it wasnt a big deal."
Mystere,"This was a MAGNIFICENT show with a mixture of humor, elegance, fun, flair, mystique, and beauty! 

The clown in the audience during seating is soooo funny, he breaks the ice with everyone and the environment becomes inviting and silly. From this all the way to the the giant baby playing with a beach ball and discovering his Papa in the audience a riot.....then the beauty of the music, costumes, drums, acrobatics, stage, lighting and brilliance! 

Cirque Du Soleil is pure genius and a class act. 

I left the show with a sense of awe, was mentally and emotionally stimulated, inspired, grateful and felt touched. 

Definately A MUST SEE!!!!!"
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque show.  Tickets are sold in 4 tiers.  The first 2 (most expensive) tiers were sold out so we went with the 3rd tier ($93/each) which scared me a bit because based on the map, they looked to be pretty far back.  Not so!  With this theater, there pretty much isnt a bad seat in the house.  And actually, because a lot of the performance was done from above, I wouldnt have liked sitting in the lower (more expensive) sections.

If there was a storyline, I didnt quite get it and I didnt love the music, but to make up for it were the times of laughter and the times of pure and utter amazement.  I have no other Cirque experience to compare to, but these performers are so incredibly (and I mean incredibly) talented.

Bravo!"
Mystere,This show was pretty interesting but I was kinda really drunk while I was watching it.. (damn those fat tuesday drinks)!! But other than that the show was entertaining especially that big baby running around the the man picking on the audience. The show was weird but interesting at the same time.
Mystere,"My favorite Cirque de Soliel by far!

There is SO much cool and nifty acrobatic stuff going on----you wont know where to look, in front of you or on top or to the sides, just be prepared to have your jaw dropped all night!

The best seats are in front, so pay up for great seats otherwise dont bother going!  Seriously you need to be up front to see it all!  We sat fourth row up from the front and were in the PERFECT row &amp; seats!

They serve snacks, get there early to see the preshow its cool and gets the crown warmed up!  Go casual or dressed up but really go casual, I went in my jeans and Chucks and was so comfy!"
Mystere,"I saw this show when it first opened and loved it then, I just saw this show a couple of days ago again and i have to say I still love it.  I see alot of people on yelp hating on this show but i really dont have any idea what they are talking about?  its very entertaining, funny and the stunts were awesome for the price you really cant beat this show...  for 400 bucks really didnt care to much for the for the show across the street that is based on a painting that steve wynn likes but thats just me"
Mystere,"Ok, so I will be the first to admit that perhaps I am not cerebral enough to grasp the whole concept of Cirque du Soleils performances. Mystere seemed to be focused on babies and ended with a giant ass snail on stage... yeah... Dont quite know what that was about.

This show still gets 5 stars from me though. Whenever I am in a theater and I see acrobatic feats that make my jaw literally drop multiple times in one sitting its worthy of 5 stars. The music was lively and kept my heart thumping, and dances were graceful and the acrobatics dramatic. 

Our tickets were in the middle of the theater and I dont think they could have been better personally. We were high enough that we didnt have to crane our necks to see anything, and still close enough that the performers were still very close to us, rather than just specks in the distance. 

I would go again in a heartbeat, and cant wait to see my next show."
Mystere,"WOW. JUST WOW. This was my first cirque du soliel show and I was in awe the whole time. Its one of the older shows so I got $80 tickets but got moved up to the front because the theater wasnt full. The set is so cool! Everything moves and people come from everywhere. These people have raw talent. Its just amazing and beautiful to watch. I didnt really understand the storyline but you dont really need to in order to  get the full experience. Oh also, theres a trickster guy that goes around taunting the audience and everyone was laughing and engaged the whole time. GO SEE THIS SHOW!"
Mystere,"My first cirque and I loved it!!!! Absolutely loved it!!!!

We sat in the second row! And my bf was picked as a prop guy.  The show was entertaining and hilarious! I absolutely loved it!

Check out the half price booth I hear the tickets are....half price!"
Mystere,"Absolutely fun!  Our first Cirque show but definitely not our last. We got seats the day before we went online from the box office. They sold beer in line, great start, and the bartender informed us that a double was only $2 extra and actually saved us cash. It let us tip Herr a but more... Our seats were about 8 rows back which was perfect. Amy closer and it would have been hard to see everything (they do pull from the audience so front row is great too.) We still had people flying over our heads which is amazing. The show combined impossible acrobatics with humor, making it fun the entire time.  Great fun, great show.  Papa"
Mystere,"We saw this show in June 2008.  This was my first Cirque show and it was absolutely amazing!! The pina colada I got at the bar inside was pretty yummy too :)

My only complaint is that we saw this show on our last night in Vegas, and if Id know how great it was going to be, I would have bought tickets to see another Cirque show while we were there as well!

We got great seats and even got 50% off our tickets with the military discount, thanks to my boyfriend!"
Mystere,"Growing up in Las Vegas, Mystere was the first of the Cirque shows to come to the strip... and everyone wanted to go there before Prom or Homecoming... which means I never did... little rebellious person that I was (or was it that tickets just were too expensive... yea, probably the latter). 

Finally I was able to see this show based on the Norse stories of creation (thanks Chris for clarification on that one) with friends over Christmas (thanks Dad for taking us all out). 

Amazing, wonderful, and well worth the 10 year wait!"
Mystere,"Great show, but my neck was a bit strained, from craning it at all the aerial acrobatics.  I think the best part was the meal at Treasure Islands Steak House, thats the name, original, huh?  We got the dinner and show package and it really was a solid meal.  Our server suggested a wonderful white wine.  Great service, salads were fresh, the filet and salmon were perfection and the sour cream cheesecake was a tasty way to end our meal.  The price was wonderful $250 for a three-course meal and a show-thats a steal in Vegas."
Mystere,"I have seen Mystere before but I was sold on mind blowing new acts. Well, not so much mind blowing, and not so much new acts. If you already have seen it, dont spend more money on it as youll probably be disappointed like my wife and I were. If its your first Cirque du soleil show, all right its worth $70 a tix but other than that I wouldnt recommend it. 
O is still my favorite CDS show by far."
Mystere,"Took my son, nephew &amp; his wife to this show, they were here celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary (all adults). They rarely get to go to shows so I knew this one would blow them away! My son &amp; I go to great shows all the time so we know what to expect if a cirque show. Some times we take for granted all the awesome shows here, it was so refreshing &amp; a reminder how awesome these shows are by just watching their faces, they were loving every minute and had their eyes glued to the stage &amp; ceiling because they did not want to miss a act! My niece thought my nephew may fall asleep because it was late &amp; we had just had dinner, I told them no way in this show, they realized just what I meant and they want to see it again on next visit from AZ! We had such a blast nothing better than seeing your loved ones so happy &amp; appreciative to see a Fab LV show, Mystere does not disappoint! Love all the entertainment &amp; Fabulous restaurants in Fab Las Vegas! Feel so Lucky to live here!"
Mystere,"This is an easy 5-star rating. Just recently went to this show after not having seen it since I was a little kid (too little too appreciate a show of this magnitude). We had an amazing time from the moment we walked in the doors. We took our seats in the second row (amazing seats!) and were amazed at how comfortable the seats where. They reclined slightly, which is actually a big deal because a lot of the acts happen wayyyy at the top of the theater. The pre-show entertainment was hilarious. The show itself really cannot be put into words. There was constantly more than one thing going on at once, 360 degrees around you. Although the performers did make a few minor errors in their routine, their energy and ability to get right back on beat was incredible. Afterwards, we stopped at the really over-priced gift shop. My only complaint is that I was too broke from my Vegas trip to be able to afford one of their beautiful knick knacks to remember the show by. Over-all, I highly recommend this show if you are visiting Vegas because it really is all -around jaw dropping-ly good."
Mystere,"The worst of the circ shows I have ever seen. The story was weak, the circ movements were eh and overall. I would see Love  even  Zumanity  ( value)out of the 3."
Mystere,"Good show! The only complaint I have (for which I deduct a star) with it is that theres too much going on and its a little hard to follow at times as a result. I came in with an expectation that there might be a story and something to follow, but thats not how it is. The acrobatics are really good, just what cirque shows are known for and theres a good mix of humor in the show. I would recommend it, but I would recommend absinthe over this one if you have a choice."
Mystere,"One of the most amazing shows Ive ever seen. The talents are beyond amazing! I brought my 6 year old cousin and he enjoyed the show as much as I did. Its jaw-dropping, colorful, and even funny."
Mystere,"Needs a storyline...

Some parts are boring, Im not really a ballet fan.
I like the trampoline acts, teeter-totter act, comedy acts.
Didnt like the ballet moves, and the random dancing around the stage.

This is my first cirque show, hopefully the others will be much better.
I did like the lion king show much better than this."
Mystere,"You cant hit up Vegas without catching a Cirque du Soleil show.  We decided to catch Mystere.  Which I have to say was pretty amazing.  A very nice blend of performance arts and music.  I found myself to be rather entertained.  It is a toss up between the baby or Brian Le Petit (funny guy with crazy white hair) as to who the show stealer was.

Our seats were in section 203 row JJ.  They were towards the back but right smack dab in the middle.  I thought they were perfect to see all the action Mystere throws at you.

My favorite performance was a toss up between the cube guy or the dynamic duo doing stone poses.  Although some poses had me giggling like a little school girl because they seemed a bit risque for two guys to perform.  But I give them mad respect for the crazy body strength these two guys possess.  

Mystere happens to be my second Cirque show.  I would certainly like to see more.  Being from Orlando, I still enjoy La Nouba.  So if you are ever in the Orlando area check out La Nouba at Downtown Disney."
Mystere,"90 minutes of pure entertainment!  Some pretty amazing acrobatics and feats of strength in this show.  How do people realize they have talents like these of this show?  The 2 guys that worked as 1, holding each other and balancing each other, WOW!  Its one thing to be buff and strong, another to do the things that these two blokes were capable of doing.  How do you figure out that you are good at this?  Is there a class. cause I would sign up, just for the total control of your body and the strength that was needed.  If you go to this show you will not be disappointed."
Mystere,"I really enjoyed the show. We had great seats and the acts were amazing. I would def recommend it, however it is pricey. I loved the act with the two strong men doing all these poses that showed how strong they are. A really fun night."
Mystere,"My husband and I got last-minute half-price tickets to a matine of this show on a Sunday.  We got seats right in front of a five year old.  Now, while this may have annoyed some people, we really got a kick out of seeing what this kid thought of all the spectacular stunts the show contains.

Acrobats wear masks on the back of their heads, then crawl down a ladder head-first, making themselves look like lizards.  The kid freaked.  A woman with a feather tail leapt up to be on the top of a four man tower- the kid yelled with glee.  It was sweet to see the show through his eyes as well as through mine.  

The stage when you walk in could use some work.  It reminded me of kind of 80s puff paint, which detracted from the coolness of the red sparkly baby carriages.  Also, the music was a little too New-Agey for me.  But the performers were spot-on, funny, well-rounded and a pleasure to see."
Mystere,"I loved this show! It was so entertaining and funny. Unlike Ka, there was no story to follow, so that made it easier on my tired self. Our seats ended up being pretty close to the stage and I happened to also be in the aisle, so I was a bit paranoid about being included in the show. But that was also what made the show so funny- the performers playing around with the unsuspecting audience.

The acrobatics were amazing. My favorite act was the 2 guys balancing on each other. It was slightly homo-erotic and well, that made it even better in my book!"
Mystere,"Stunning!  If I could do my life all over again I would be in Vegas working as a trapeze girl in Mystere.  

I was impressed with all of the acts, and the run time of the show was perfect (about an hour to an hour and a half).

I didnt really dig the adult baby between the acts so much, but luckily that wasnt a huge part of the show.

There was really no discernible theme or plot, just really freaking weird and mind blowing costumes and dexterity."
Mystere,"Mystere is getting a little long in the teeth.  It is of the original Cirque style in elaborate circus acts.  Dont take me wrong, it is worth it to see, as they again have superb athletes and performers. 

However, I must warn you, once you see O and/or Ka, you may not like the more routine Mystere. 

Still a Cirque show though, and should please all."
Mystere,"My personal favorite is still O and followed by Zumanity that deserved 5 stars. Mystere wasnt bad and Im glad I picked this over Ka since Ka did not have very good reviews or it being mediocre. 
Mystere was very engaging but certain acts seemed to have been done at other shows. However, the costumes were colorful and definitely fabulous but they did put in a lot of fillers (adult baby and this clown-like character) a few times throughout the show, I guess to fill in the slot while the other characters change into something else or when the production crew prepares the stage. 

Overall, a good time, cheaper tickets compared to Ka and suitable for children as well."
Mystere,"Fabulous.  These are some serious acrobats...with some seriously talented costume designers.  Incredible costumes, special effects, and even some really funny moments.  Very whimsical.  The performers do truly amazing things--Id swear their muscles have muscles.  I loved every minute of it, and would see it again if possible.

For the very shy and/or easily embarrassed: be forewarned that there may be a certain amount of audience participation.  On the way in, look out for the guy in a tux with the crazy hair.  ;)  If youre REALLY scared of having to ham it up, stay home...but only if you are absolutely terrified, because otherwise, this show is well worth it.

I just wish I hadnt had popcorn and a drink during the show, because I was so engrossed in the show that I didnt really want to eat or drink!  At one point, they did something amazing, and I accidentally dropped some popcorn down my cleavage.  Oops."
Mystere,"Unimpressed.  I have pretty much seen every Cirque show in Vegas, as well as shows in San Francisco and Orange County.  I am a gigantic Cirque FANATIC.  ((50% off tickets for everyone in your party if just one of you sports a military ID.))

This show is an absolute drag.  To top it off, this was my BFFs very first Cirque show and I am so disappointed that I didnt choose another show to take her to.

Mystere is poorly directed, with an incoherent storyline / message.  More than half of the show is comedy which is just borderline funny and more-so annoying.  Cirque usually prides itself on turning the mundane into something fantastic.  Not so for Mystere.  

90% of the acts are acrobatic, and can be seen everywhere from Ringling Bros to the county fair.  No different take on the feats whatsoever.  What you expect from the trapeze, aerial high bar, poles, bungee, plank, etc..... is exactly what you expect.  Youll see that having low expectations met is actually worse than simply being disappointed.

The remaining 10% of the acts include taiko drums (UCI taiko team does a better and more enthralling number than these Cirque drummers) and extremely homoerotic strength feats (the performers are actually brothers, but its still uncomfortable to watch).

TIP:  If you are going to check this show out regardless, get seats in the BACK.  AA - MM.  In the center.  Like I said, this show is mainly acrobatic, and you will miss a lot of the action the closer you get to the stage.

Two stars because this show only cost me $75 for three center row LL tickets as a Cirque premiere member and military dependent.  Sometimes the most economical choice is not the most satisfying."
Mystere,"Watched a lot of shows, this one was well below average. Lot of mistakes in the co-ordination among performers spoiled all the fun, add to it the rude staff. One of the performer announced at the beginning of the show that flash photography is not allowed, after which people turned off the flash to take snaps, only to find a rude old lady coming up and almost getting physical with them and snatching their cameras- saying photography is not allowed at all. They need to be specific in giving the instruction. No one wants to take a snap of their mediocre show if they are not allowed to, but for Gods sake save them the humiliation by telling them. Gamble and lose your money than to watch this show!! 
Overall Average Performance, Poor staff, overrated"
Mystere,"Excellent !! Thats simply how Mystere was! A visual spectacle of colors, costumes, acrobatics, artistry and spellbinding live music! This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and although I heard how good their shows are, its still lovely experience to witness it live.  Loved the whole thing. 
On the low side (very negligible) - 
1) The woman in the baby costume did a good job, only she dint look like one :) 
2) And the plot of the whole show wasnt quite clear although, u dont really mind confusing beauty do u ? ;) 
3) Wished I could understand the songs (couldnt even understand the lang) but who cares, really, when the music was so mesmerizing! 
A great job really! Grab a seat in the middle section of the theater and ur set.Try getting tickets at a discounted price and the experience will only get sweeter..!"
Mystere,"Only 4+ stars because 5 stars reserved for KA and  O 
The beginning of the show, the crowd is entertained by a clown. It is mostly mild and harmless audience abuse, but it ifs fun to watch---especially since it is happening to someone else... for those who havent seen a Cirque show it combines mechanical magic, live music and spectacular circus acts...when in Vegas see a Cirque show..."
Mystere,"This was the first Cirque Ive ever watched, about 10 years ago.  I LOVED it!!!  I was so amazed and impressed with the entire thing!  Then I watched a few other Cirques over time but I still liked Mystere the best...Until I watched it again recently...

After watching Mystere the second time, I realized that there was just so much going on at the same time, all over the stage, the walls, everywhere!  My head was constantly turning trying to figure out which way to look.  Although it is a good story line and funny (who wouldnt love a 200-pound baby?! LOL!) there is just too many different things going on all at the same time.

In my own opinion, if you see one Cirque, youve seen them all.  Acrobats and stunts are the same thing over and over, and after a while it gets hard to compare which you actually like better."
Mystere,"All the stunts look old, and seems like ive seen most of them on TV before.... Couple of stunts were completely repetitive, and the same thing repeats again and again ... and again.... and ofcourse how can I forget , again !! (especially in the stunts where guys on the bars hang from the top)

Stage doesnt do much except go up and down, and the screen in the background, and the blown up Snail/Mascot in the end look worn out and really aged. 

It is not visually stunning anymore as most of the stunts can be seen on Talent shows over the world (especially the one with 2 guys performing acrobatics on each other). 

All in all, not worth the money. All my friends who had seen Ka, Le Reve and O were completely disappointed."
Mystere,"What a contemporary circus is supposed to be. Cirque Du Soleil Mystere Captures the quintessence of performing circus arts. Mystere is like watching living art unfold in a narrative. Dazzling world-class acrobats, performers and athletes present astounding feats of human ability, which combined magnificent costumes that drip with subtle sexuality and exoticness, produce a visual bliss. The live orchestra and massive drums will pound you with rhythmic gratification; dont be surprised when the hairs on your arms stand up with the introduction song Ouverture Ramsani. Myster along with O are spectacles that can only be seen, and not explained. If you are in Vegas, they are a must see!

Pros: Visually spectacular, Musically Astounding
Cons: Hard to get tickets sometimes
Overall Rating: 6 of 5 (thats right 6 out of 5)
Recommendation: Must See"
Mystere,I loved this show.. I cant wait to see O... So looking forward to it. Great seats and paid a decent price. We stood at the TI so it was convient that Mystere was right down stairs. If you are in doubt of seeing it... Believe me.. it is worth EVERY penny!~
Mystere,"Mystere is like a unedited acid trip.  In between pockets of trippy acrobatics are stretches of absurdist boring shit that would qualify as exposition or narrative if it made any sense.

Look Cirque du Soliel.  Face it, youre acrobatic porn.  Just stick to hard core acrobatics and stop pretending theres a larger theme behind it.

4 stars for the acrobatic parts.  1/2 a star for the rest."
Mystere,"I tried to get on stage so I could get the two beautiful acrobat guys who stand on each others heads to sign a contract that they would perform at my 30th birthday party, but I ended up getting a bucket of popcorn dumped on my head...

All jokes aside, the show was awesome, and it had better been for $100 a pop.  I liked the salamander guys who kept going up and down the poles as well as the trampoline guys.  The guy with the silver cube was a fav, but the two guys just left me breathless.  All I could think was damn, thats hot and be completely envious of whoever they sleep with.  

The music was great, but the only reason I take one star off is that I wish it had a little bit more of a plot .  Otherwise - abso-feckin-lutely amazing."
Mystere,"Loved this show (although it is not KA).

Why you should go see this show...

*the performers of Cirque de soleil are amazing...all of the acrobatics, the bouncing on the trampolines, the trapeze acts, the two ambiguously gay muscle men balancing act!  I want to run away &amp; join the cirque...looks like so much fun.

*The old guy misleading people to their seat was funny &amp; he had more laughs under his sleeve during the show

*the audience interaction

**Dont come here &amp; expect to be wowed with a crazy moving set hence the 4 stars

**Also didnt find the adult baby funny

**TIP:  go to the various tix 4 tonight places on the strip (www.tix4tonight.com)...you can get big discounts on show tixs."
Mystere,"Woah. For a cheap show, this is amazing! Cirque du Soleil seamlessly blends music, acrobatics, and their signature style that no other has perfectly. Went to this show and will never forget it."
Mystere,"My third Cirque show, and so far my least favorite. The theatre is beautiful, the comedy is decent, the acrobatics are amazing, the music is flawless.

My issue was really the lack of (expected) story line (its billed as telling the story of the mystery of life). If it were billed as a circus of amazing acrobatics with some random comedic relief thrown in I would have left with a different taste in my mouth."
Mystere,"Maybe its just me! Every time Im in Vegas Im always being told you gotta see a show, go check out Mystere. Then the person goes on to say how they have seen it multiple times and how great it is. 

So, me and my ruca decide to check it out. It was kinda of a last minute thing so we had to spend a little extra and get good seats. By a little extra I mean a little over 200.00 for 2 tickets, not bad I guess since it is such a great show.  Dont fall for that good seats bullshit either. The theater isnt that big, so any seat is a good seat.

Dont get me wrong the guy that comes out before the show to warm up the audience is funny and the shit they do is incredible. But I can only tolerate so much tumbling, acrobats and whatever else they do. Long story short I fell asleep. I dont get how people say they have seen this show more than once, I mean come on once is really enough. 

Maybe Im just not a show guy, but I would save my money and spend it else where in Vegas. Mystere is a one time only thing, and even that might be too much."
Mystere,"This was my very first cirque and it was ok, then I saw it again many years later and got so much more out of it.  There is a story line that I didnt get the first time and many say that cirques dont have a story line but I disagree.  I still have to say my favorite cirque is KA."
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoyed it! We got discount tickets at one of those ticket places on the Strip so we paid $60 or $70 for front row tickets. We were on the side, but we definitely had a great view of everything. The line was SO long to get in, but it goes extremely fast once the doors open. They say show up an hour before showtime, but if you have your tickets, I dont think thats necessary. Right before the show starts, one of the people in the show plays jokes on the audience members. Everything from throwing popcorn at them, balancing popcorn buckets on their heads, leading people to the wrong seats, ripping up tickets, etc. Hilarious but I was glad Id found my seat before he started his shenanigans! As for the show itself, it is non-stop the whole way through. Theres comedy in between the acrobatics, which gives a nice breather (for audience and performers!). All the acts (hand to hand, Chinese poles, trapeze, trampoline, etc.) were beyond amazing, as were the costumes and music. Some of it was kind of freaky, but hey, thats what its all about right?"
Mystere,"Mystère is a wildly entertaining, spectacular, and unforgettable show.  

The stage becomes a playground for the imagination.  The costumes are fantastic.  The acrobatic performers display amazing, gravity-defying strength and grace.  

Mystère is performance art at its best.  The story is like a dream that cannot be fully grasped.  It is a wonderful mystery open to interpretation.

If you worry too much about the theme, the storyline, and understanding what it all means, then youll miss a great show.  Just enjoy the ride."
Mystere,"Amazing show and if its your first Cirque du Soleil event its a good one to start with.

Tickets are pricey and Id recommend trying to shop around for some cheap ones, but thats pretty standard with all Vegas events nowadays.  Good for all members of the family, incredible acrobatics, interesting show (to get the most enjoyment out of it, I recommend not taking the storyline too seriously).

We were in the far back, but center and we still had a great view of everything that was going on.  Oddly we could probably see the acrobatics more clearly because we were higher up in the audience.

If this is your first exposure to Cirque du Soleil, this is a good one to watch, perfect for families as well.

That said, watching it once is enough, perhaps again in many years Ill try it again, but theres a lot more out there to check out before then and the Mystere show wont be changing much."
Mystere,"Sensory overload.

It reminded me of Dr. Seuss, Oompa Loompas, Lion King (just for a second) and a little Alice in Wonderland.

Its so busy - tons of things to see. Took me a bit to get used to all the lights - and youll be watching someone and thinking wow! and then at the same time theres a girl in the background walking on a ball the whole time.

The acrobatics are AMAZING. I also enjoyed the performers that were swinging up on top - I felt like a kid wondering what itd be like to fly.

Any seat is good, so no need to stress over that there =)"
Mystere,This was the first Cirque du Soleil show I ever saw and I was mesmerized by it.  I saw it back in 2006.  I was able to get discounted tickets for the show with decent seats... we went to this show cause it was the cheapest of Cirque du Soleils at the time.  There was so much going on that I feel that i need to go back and see it again.  While the Wow factor was not quite as intense as O (which I just saw) there seemed to be more going on at this show.  Both are worth seeing!
Mystere,"I saw the show a couple of years ago with my family. Ive seen a bunch of LV shows and this one stacks up, but nothing special."
Mystere,The show was beautiful! Very creative and MYSTERIOUS with all the different creatures if you say? I am amazed at how the acrobats jump from pole to pole and how flexible the contortionists are! A great show. The name of the show goes perfectly lol!
Mystere,"Went to see the show 2 nights ago.  It was recommended by the girl who booked our tickets that seating further up is better so we made that choice but looking back, I rather sit closer.  Maybe that was their ploy to get rid of the crappy tickets?  I hated the baby, the clown and the other guy in the red suit, it didnt seem to fit in with the concept and was plain silly.  I truly enjoyed the acrobats and the two men balancing one another.  What a testiment to human strength!  I will be going to see O the next time I am in Vegas."
Mystere,What a show!  We were fully entertained and engaged for the duration.  Ill not devulge any of the acts because you must go and see for yourself.  You wont be disappointed.  I purchased tickets weeks ahead from a reseller.  Would recommend you go directly to the ticket office at Treasure Island.  GO!
Mystere,"5 rows back, left of center, which I think was better than any closer row as we could see down into the sinking stage better.  The popcorn dump victim was about 10 feet away and we were not victimized for audience participation which I was glad for.  Great sets, moving stage elements, lighting, live music, acrobatics, freaky costumes.  The set movements and action elements really kept the eyes moving all around the theater.  I thought the drumming parts got a little off beat at times, my only negative thought.  Ill see another CS show next time to get more perspective."
Mystere,"I love them all! I hate to bring up what everyone else already has....but cmon.... it doesnt get much funnier at a Cirque show than the Fat Baby.  
Again, the music to this very one, very magical and beautiful.  Ive actually sen this one twice.... and would go again."
Mystere,"Amazing, aerial, homoerotic, muscles, half naked men everywhere, elaborate costumes, funny, amazing feats of strength, acrobatics like you have never seen, surreal, unreal, awesome music, awe, shock and amazement, funny.

I could go on and on with more to describe what is the most amazing Cirque show I have ever seen. This is my first Vegas Cirque show and it left me absolutely breathless and wanting more. Cirque du Soleil lives up to its well deserved reputation with this production.

There was one act between 2 gymnasts who demonstrated amazing feats of strength with slow, deliberate movements, their bodies intertwined in ways you cant even begin to imagine. These guys had two of the most amazing physiques I have ever seen. Their incredible muscled bodies were strained with every move, and I waited with anticipation to see if they were going to burst through their skin.

I lived here for a long time and each time I return Ill be seeing another one. I might even get a chance to see Zumanity before I leave. Awesome."
Mystere,"As always, the performers w/ the Cirque never fail to impress the hell out of me.
Loved it.  Not as much as some of the other shows Ive seen, but still loved it nonetheless.
My only complaint was that I had to sit next to some dude who kept saying ahhhhh after every sip of his crappy Bud Lite."
Mystere,"I watched Mystere less than a couple of weeks ago, and I found it entertaining. It probably had the most comedic acts than any other Cirque du Soleil show that Ive seen, especially with the baby running around doing random stuff, as well as audience participation. Nice acrobatics. My favorite part was with two very, well-formed men....there were a couple of people chuckling in the back row from where I sat, but I dont blame them! The two guys were moving together very slowly and closely to areas of intimacy!

Our seats werent too bad. We were somewhere around the upper double letter section, but it provided a view of the whole performance. Watch it if you can get a good deal for this show. After all, you can pay a little bit more to watch a more impressive CDS show like O or Le Reve right, especially if youre vacationing in Vegas?"
Mystere,"Wife and I came to see this show last December because most of the other cirque shows were on break. The acts were very impressive! This is our first cirque show, so not sure if all of them are similarly slow paced between acts. The time-killing with the actor pretending to be a baby got a little boring as it wore on. Would probably consider seeing one of the other shows some time."
Mystere,"SPEECHLESS........really must see...I cant explain it but all I know is its worth the money..........BRILLIANT, AMAZING, truly a great experience! Go see it for yourself! I know I sound a bit like an advertisement for them...but I was truly in awe after the show......Ive seen like two of the Circque Du Solei shows before and they are always amazing and leaves me speechless. =) 

My goal is to see all of them! =)

The only freakin complaint I have was not at all the show or venue but the couple that sat in the row in front of us....two obnoxious folks that kept howling and cheering like its a freakin rock concert...ppl youre in the wrong place for that! have some class would yah? and not talk during the show.....they were loud and made loud comments when it wasnt even appropriate....they were the only thing that was annoying me...oh yeah and the kid that sat behind me which wouldnt stop freakin complaining about wanting to go home and asked his mommy when would the show be over every ten minutes.  Ppl dont take your kids if you know they cant sit through a 2 hour show...I paid good money for this show and I dont want it to be ruin by a little kid that wont stop whining....and for ppl to be yelling loudly at the wrong time....I understand the acrobats are amazing but applauding and some wows and ahhs is good....they way the couple cheered was just so distracting and annoying...-_-

Other than that I love Cirque Du Solei! =D"
Mystere,"Ive seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows including Ka, O, and Mystere.  I think Myesteres the best one.  The acrobatics and energy of the show is great.  Nothing is more impressive than the hand-to-hand show which features two brothers doing amazing acrobates.  It is breath taking."
Mystere,"Go see it, you will not be disappointed! This cirque show is the first cirque show in las vegas! Ive seen a few cirque shows in Vegas and this is one of my favorite! The acrobatic will leave you thinking...how in the world did they do that? We got our tickets at Tix4Less, they have several locations throughout the strip...its not a huge discount, but you still save a little bit!"
Mystere,"Show: A great show! Very entertaining and funny.  My favorite part of the show was the balancing act...amazing!!!!!! (also the guys had unbelievably rock solid bodies!) Also for those of you sitting in the front rows, be prepared to be selected randomly to participate in the show!

Theater: Located right in Treasure Island. The theater was great. It wasnt super big and considering the cheap price I paid for our seats, we had a great view.

Price: Not bad at all. I guess this is the oldest Cirque show in Vegas so the cheapest ticket price was around $67 or so. Definitely well worth the price!"
Mystere,"Very nice theatre... I liked it a lot better than the traveling cirque shows in terms of the seating.  The show was really beautiful but could have used more impressive acrobatics.   we would have watched O instead but rats it wasnt playing the weekend we were there...boo hoo.

if youve never seen cirque before youll love it... if you have seen it before its nothing above and beyond the other shows like Kooza, Dralion (my favorite so far), and Allegria"
Mystere,"I know the acrobats are hard. i know the costumes and prosthetics are great. i know the stage lighting is good. I know the engineering staff are great. I know that.

But this is Circque du soleil. of course they made a name already, I had great expectations--which makes it hard for me to accept my fate this night.
I was literally sleeping at the last 1/4 of the show. Or was i tired? I was disappointed @ the end of the show or was i just mesmerized with Koozas experience.

poor story line, music was not really grandiose and the margins of the concept were so ambiguous. I hope they dont repeat what clicked in other shows next time. I wouldve seen Ka had i known this like this."
Mystere,The show was just okay. The story wasnt very good. Some impressive acrobats.
Mystere,"Amazing.

The performances were stunning.  The staging was impressive.  The music was live and excellent.  I loved that interludes between performances were comedic.

This show is slightly less expensive and longer than other Cirques but dont let that mislead you.  Its amazing.

A tip: when considering seats the center is better than sides, even if it means sitting a little further back."
Mystere,"This is an immensely enjoyable show. Not your usual Big Top circus act. The performance was exciting from beginning to end. I got seats at the left hand side of the stage,next time ill get the middle row. I had some discomfort in my neck area,since performers are coming in front, on the side and down from the ceiling...Overall i really did enjoy this show.

I will see more shows from Cirque de Soleil next trip to Vegas."
Mystere,"This was an awesome show. I guess its about dreams, but the little girl was adorable and the things these Cirque people can do is utterly amazing. I did feel a little offended that there were big bellied-pregnant looking characters..but maybe because im that big-bellied-pregnant character right now.
The only thing I found kinda uncomfy is the two strong men that were very homo-erotic...(to clarify im a no on prop-8) The movement was slow and sensual looking to me but crazy about the agility and strength.
A must see and with this economy- you can even get a buy one- get one for $25 or other deals. No seat is a bad seat."
Mystere,The show was funny.  But the act was a bit old.  Nothing that I havent seen on TV.  We enjoyed KA whole lot more.
Mystere,This is one of my very favorite Cirque du Soleil shows of all time.  It is so much fun.  Amazing acrobats and good for kids!  Music was very cool as well.
Mystere,"After seeing Ka, a little underwhelmed.  Was it one of the first Cirques?

I would look for the cheapest tickets.  Every seat in every Cirque show is good, so dont spend too much on this one.  Its good, but its not KA."
Mystere,"First of all, get the discounted tickets one of the many stands (Tix4tonight) along the strip.  There is not a bad seat in the house and it will save you about half the cost of the show.  We  got tickets this way and had great seats.  Looking around the theater I dont think I would be disappointed to sit anywhere in the theater.   The show is excellent.  It is funny, amazing, engaging and filled with incredibly talented entertainers.   From amazing displays of strength and agility to comedy this show really has it all.   Both my wife and I LOVED this show; it was the highlight of our trip."
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil in Vegas, i really didnt know what to expect. It was filled with breathtaking acts and humor, very entertaining. i would highly recommend this show! they use the audience for a few acts, i couldnt stop myself from laughing. Take some time off from gambling and watch this show. Its well worth the $60 dollars military discount!"
Mystere,"I enjoyed this show very much- it has the very impressive athleticism and strange earthy, natural weirdness that all Cirque shows seem to have.  The various show elements, without exposing any surprises or secrets, are incredibly well orchestrated and the humor, as well as mystery, are well incorporated throughout the theme of the show.  The showroom is expansive and amazing, and the mechanics of the set are awe-striking. In my opinion, start by seeing O at the Bellagio, my personal favorite, and if you have time for a second show, give this a try.  Good value none-the-less for a $100/approx ticket."
Mystere,"I love this show! From the amazing acrobatics to the Taiko drummers hanging off of the ceiling this show was amazing. I loved the drum set and was so sad it wasnt on the cd I had to get the live cd for it.

I dont know if hes still there anymore, but I absolutely hated the clown running around pre-show stealing popcorn and emptying it onto random people. He even stole a hand full of mine. Lucky he didnt eat it all or I would have beaten him to a pulp. Nothing stands between me and my popcorn! My program even had a strangely amusing disclaimer for him as being allowed to carry on his crass antics because he had gotten a hold of certain secret Cirque du Soleil documents. Yeah... Not so amusing if he puts popcorn grease stains on your $500 dress.

Still, I dont let the stupid clown bring the shows rating below 5 stars. Great Show!"
Mystere,"Mystere has been playing for some time and anyone can see why once seeing the show.  Its everything you love from a Cirque Du Soleil show; acrobatics, dangerous feats, mind-blowing talent, and audience interaction.  It takes all this talent and delivers it on a plate of humor and color.  

The ticket prices are fairly inexpensive, as low as $55 if you buy them on the strip, and theres the Sirens of T.I. just outside the hotel to watch before a show or dinner.  If you dont have the money to see O, definitely try and catch Mystere.  Its one of the shows you can even bring your children to.  It just doesnt have anything on O."
Mystere,"Odd, I could have sworn I made a review for this. This was the first Cirque show I have ever been to in vegas(I went in 2007). Well, its great for groups of all ages of course and every seat is a good seat. I think, of all the cirque shows, this is the one that is,the most circus out of all of them. Its well rounded with acrobatics and  clown comedy fun.  

Ill be checking out Zumanity next and then O and Ka. Maybe, when the new Cirque show opens( I think its going to be at the new City Center and will be based off of Elvis music), Ill check it out too."
Mystere,"this is the first cirque show ive ever seen and it was just a few months ago.  i heard that they had redone some of the show (not that i would know since it was my first time).  i have no idea what the tickets cost, as it was a date, but i definitely recommend this show!  i think its a good show to see as your first cirque experience.  i mean the entire show, i was in amazement at the different acrobatics/stunts they do.  the costumes were also pretty interesting.  the show itself is in a big auditorium with theater like seating.  you can even have popcorn!  such a great show to see with the family or on a date or with a large group of friends.  there was a variety of all different groups.  definitely worth the $$$"
Mystere,"I had my doubts when I was buying tickets for this.  I was told it was the first cirque show and more acrobatic like an actual circus.  I saw La Reve (water show) before and didnt want anything less than that.  I was amazed the entire show and the colors, the comedy, the acrobatics!  It was entertaining from even before the show til the very end.  It is worth every penny.  I do remember being cold inside, so ladies if you are wearing a skimpy dress ready to go clubbing right after, wear one with long sleeves or bring a shawl!"
Mystere,Kinda disappointing have only OVO to compare it to but didnt think this one was as good. Actually found myself falling asleep a couple of times.
Mystere,"3.5 stars

Ive seen this before and this time around, I thought it was ok as well.  My dad was not too impressed b/c he grew up watching acrobatic shows in Asia (minus the sound effects, stage, costumes aka gimmicks).  He thought the difficulty of the feats was just mediocre compared to what hes seen.  My dad and I prefer the O show."
Mystere,"My favorite out of ALLLLL the Cirque shows, well, Cheval was pretty cool, but it was a traveling show.  I have seen Mystere AT LEAST 7 times.  I love the soundtrack.  There always seems to be something new in the show, even though Im sure theres not.  Its just that there is so much going on, that you cant take it all in.  My friend Mandy works the show, so thats helpful, since its my favorite, hahaha.  I even got to go backstage and see how everything works.  Thanks Mandy.  ;-)

One thing that I did learn recently about the show is that the older clown they have opening the show, you know the one that steals peoples popcorn.  Well, hes been in the circus business for something like 40 years.  I could be wrong about the exact number of years.  All I know is that he must REALLY like being a clown."
Mystere,"O and Mystere are probably the most entertaining of the Cirque shows Ive seen (O, Mystere, Zumanity, one other one Ive forgotten the name of).  I would say that Mystere is the more compelling in terms of pure human exertion and effort, but that O trumps it in terms of grandiosity and flair which is why I prefer O.

But, I dont think anyone would be disappointed in watching either.  The only warning I can give you about watching Mystere is that the show is most memorable (for me) for its SNL Ace and Gary moment(s) (see:  the Ambiguously Gay Duo).  Youll know it when you see it."
Mystere,"I got bad seats on line but when we got there they were filling in a few seats so we got moved up close to the stage. This show was crazy, whacked, beautiful. I loved the old french guy who popped up through out the show. Just loved him. I loved the creep baby who wanted his daddy. Loved the audience interaction. The show is a little trippy but most Cirque De Solelis are. There was so much talent. I really enjoyed myself. Heads up. They have hard core security making sure NO ONE video tapes during the show. They are watching and will find you. This one guy had his Iphone taken. Too bad folks cant just sit back and watch."
Mystere,"Not necessarily my favorite that Ive seen (Ive seen LOVE, Iris and Ovo) but it had its moments! As my sister said, I didnt know what I was watching, but I guess that was the point. It was a mish-mash of graceful and beautiful acrobats dressed as animals seen in the Nevada desert thrown in with other random costumed people who just kind of stood there, and bumbling adult babies all at once, in a way that had no order or rhythm. I still liked it though - it had an aire to it that reminded me a lot of Jim Hensons more serious work, stuff like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth in tone, and considering it came from almost that time period (early 90s) - it was very obvious from the music, which although really good and charged, felt dated. There were two performers in an act that was worth it, who balanced and moved on each other in a feat of pure strength that was absolutely amazing. Some trapeze, some silk, other things you can see anywhere else, true, but still fun to watch. Some neat stuff done with poles! I always appreciate such talent. The man-baby, I thought, was a fun example of good character acting, as the guy really nails down the movements and characteristics reminiscent of a 1-year old, and the main clown, although the popcorn bit as others have mentioned became a little bit of a tired gag, shined during a bit where he puts an audience member in a cage. If youve seen O or LOVE, youre probably not going to be as wowed by the aura of it as someone who is new to cirque. A good beginner cirque, for sure!"
Mystere,"Visually entertaining, and impressive acrobats, I will hands down give em that.  

However....for me...I hated it. I was left very unsatisfied (like a thirst that couldnt be quenched) and confused at some concepts. I honestly thought there was going to be a storyline. I was waiting for the climax in the story and the whole thing was just a huge explosion.

Ill never see this one again."
Mystere,"I thoroughly enjoyed EVERY aspect of the show! I have been a fan for long time, I used to watch the behind the scenes on Bravo needless to say as a first time experience i was extremely impressed! Would love to see another one!"
Mystere,"My first expereince and it was Awesome!!!! My boyfriend came along and at first he kept hesitating on going, saying its kind of wierd seeing other dudes in tight pants and what not. He thought it was just like a gymnastic show. But was amazed and was nothing what hed pictured, and ended up enjoying the show. Their talent is absolutely amazing. Their customes are crazy looking but interesting.  The show was hilarious and they also interacted with the audience which was funny to see.  This is a wonderful experience and no one should miss it."
Mystere,I loved this show ! i really think this is the best of all the Cirque De Soleil. I digged the music and the acts.Everything was changed up with different themes and equipment keeping it fresh throughout. I really enjoyed this one. Watch This !!!
Mystere,"I wouldnt go out of my way to see this again, and Im glad I got discounted tickets for the show, but that doesnt mean it wasnt good. Cirque shows never cease to amaze me. Take advantage of the weakened economy in Vegas (sorry, Vegas folks!) to get tickets at a reduced rate. I have to admit that I couldnt help but remember that scene from Knocked Up while I was watching the show, especially when I went back to my room at The Palazzo with its many different kinds of chairs."
Mystere,"This is an amazing show. This was the first Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen and still my favorite. You are transplanted into a fantasy world of magic and beauty, where everything is a fairy tale and reality is blurred. The characters are endearing and the stunts are breathtaking. The whole set and ensemble is such a feat...and the giant snail is just fabulous."
Mystere,"parking is always away from the casino so its gonna be a walk.

its a good thing the hotel has this show because its what a TYPICAL Cirque show is always like.

If youve seen them on television and you say, that looks nice.  Being here in person is MUCH better.  The acrobats, the music, the clowns.  they all blend together and their timing is perfect.  The decorations, the acts, the people who are watching, everyone is enthralled.

I cant tell you more about the show because, I WILL NOT RUIN IT FOR YOU!

I have less to say about it, because, There isnt anything about this Cirque that stands out from all the other Cirques, but its still a MUST SEE."
Mystere,"Attended the show on Wednesday of last week, mostly because there werent many other Cirque Du Soleil options in Vegas that day and because its cheaper than other Cirque shows. It was our first Cirque Du Soleil show ever. We absolutely loved it! We had front row seats and got to see the action real up close, how exciting! Throughout the entire show I was greatly entertained and amazed; the acts, the live music, the old guy and the baby picking on people from the audience, everything. The show was worth every dollar we paid. If this is a good intro to Cirque Du Soleil, I cant wait til we attend other Cirque Du Soleil shows!"
Mystere,"People need to chill, these people worked their asses off and I bet you couldnt go up there and performed any of this, even if you tried (unless youve been a gymnast since you were 5 years old).  Yes, there wasnt a story, but it still had recurring themes and great acrobats.  I thought it was funny, made my mouth drop and had me clapping in the end. The only thing was that I sat at the very front and had to bend my head back in order to be able to see everything.  But, still it was amazing."
Mystere,Great show! I saw it for the 2nd time on the 15th. And it was awesome as it was the first time I saw it!
Mystere,My first Cirque du Soleil show and well worth it. Save money by researching show tickets and take a gamble and sit in category 3. The theater has a fantastic layout and intimate enough so sitting on the sides will give you a great view. Avoid the lower sections near the stage as you will end up with a kink in your neck as many acrobatic performances are up high. Looking forward in seeing O and KA next!
Mystere,"Ive been to all the Cirque shows in Vegas an felt this was the worst.  Best part was the clown that interacted with the audience at the beginning and again toward the middle.  Expected a lot better lighting/effects etc.  Gymnastics were very similar to other shows - saw nothing new, interesting or groundbreaking here.  For the price of tickets i expected much better from a Cirque performance."
Mystere,"Entertaining show with immense, immense talent. I always love cirque shows because I cannot even fathom having the skills those people have!!! This show was a little slow in parts so minus one star. But the acrobatics and the flying man with the cube are exquisite and for sure do-not-try-at-home stunts."
Mystere,Crazy good... not sure what the sumo-sized baby was for but he was pretty hilarious! If youve ever been to a Cirque du Soleil show this does not disappoint!
Mystere,"This is the second Cirque show I have seen, and I love all of them! They all seem to challenge your imagination, and the performers are amazing!"
Mystere,This was our first Cirque show and rates only slightly behind Zumanity as one of our favorites.  This is a typical Cirque show in all its glory.  Nothing else needs to be said.
Mystere,Took my boyfriend for his bday.  He looooooved it. :) SCORE!!!  it was his first time at CDS and he cant wait to see others.  Suggestion: know the storyline/theme beforehand. it helps. :)  worth the money so see it! :)
Mystere,"My first Cirque du Soleil show. I really enjoyed it. Youll laugh and be thoroughly entertained throughout the show. The clown who comes out during the pre-show is very funny so make sure to get to the theater at least half-hour before.

I only paid $62.50 for second tier seats with the August special so look on-line for discounts.  

Great show. Youll walk out amazed at the acrobatics and with a smile on your face."
Mystere,"I saw this in October 2010 and have to say I was disappointed. I have seen other Cirque Du Soleil shows and I have to agree with some of the other reviews in that this is one of their weaker shows. There wasnt a clear theme and at times there were too many acrobats on stage. I was counting the minutes to leave. I couldnt focus on what was going on to be interested. The costumes and set props looked dinghy and old. Whites where not bright, etc. The show just looks dated. 

Notes about seating: If you are not sitting in the center 1/2 of the theater forget about going to the show. I have never been in a theater where so much of the seating area is terrible!!!!! The stage is very very deep so if you are anywhere on the sides, even center side you miss a ton of the action. They also have actors that stand in the aisles. Of course I had one stand right in front of me.

For the amount you pay pick a different Cirque du Soleil show."
Mystere,My first Cirque experience and I took my family.  It was truly entertaining.  When in Vegas it a must see!
Mystere,"Ive seen three Cirque shows now (Mystere, Zumanity, and KA) and of the three, this is my favorite. I absolutely intend to see it again!"
Mystere,"this show was AMAZING! there were some parts that kind of creeped me out a bit...the baby strollers and the baby sounds before the show and when the guys with the white wigs were walking out of the side doors and just kind of stood in the audience. i dont really know if i fully understand the concept of the show but i dont really care because all the acrobatics and dancing was amazing. the comedy was funny too, i really like how they get some of the audience involved in the show. best part was the two guys doing the hand balancing. FUCKING nuts! those guys were so strong its almost ridiculous. 

i honestly dont what else to say other than GO SEE IT!! =)"
Mystere,"You need to go into this with an open mind.  Its a trippy walk into a dream, with the best acrobats, set, dance, music combination youll ever witness.  Theres also plenty of humor mixed in.  I saw this fifteen  years ago and enjoyed seeing it thru the eyes of friends who hadnt seen it before."
Mystere,"Extremely funny and entertaining. Awesome stunts by energetic performers. Nice theater, extravagant stage effects. Definitely meets the Cirque grand expectations. Nice bar (Kahunaville) next door to grab a drink and watch some great flair bar tending pre show."
Mystere,"This is the only Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen.  Overall it was a fun and with the discounted tickets I feel like I got my moneys worth.  The show features some amazing acrobatics and other acts that I can only describe as incredible feats of strength (you must see it to believe it).  

The show also has a lot of artsy showmanship which I guess is needed so that the performers can prepare between their main acts.  But a lot of the artsy dancing and the little acts with an eccentric ring leader or a man dressed up as a baby do get a little tiring after a while.  The little comedy routines fall flat after watching some great performances.  Its like someone offers you some chopped liver after you had a bite of some great steak.

Mystere is a whimsical experience of lighting, music, costumes, and performances.  I dont know about the other shows in Vegas but I cannot imagine how they could be any more entertaining at more than twice the price."
Mystere,"My favorite Cirque de Soilel show! Very artistic, very acrobatic, great music, and great set design. This show has it all - feats of strength, flexibility, and a lot of humor."
Mystere,"The only Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen.  Very good acrobatics, costumes, and music with a european flavor.  I sat in the second tier which gave me a good perspective on the aerial acrobatics and drummers that are suspended right over the audience.  My friends sat in the first tier and they missed some of the aerial acts but where more immersed in stage action.  An awesome display of strength and agility - those 72 performers get my respect.  I was never into spending the money on watching a Cirque show, but now I recommend Mystere since it has really sparked my interest into seeing all the others - Ka, Zumanity, O, Love, etc."
Mystere,"I had one of the most horrifying experiences of my life at Mystere.  Somehow, we had gotten seats in the front row.

A performer dressed in a baby suit rolled a gigantic orange ball off the stage and it somehow landed right in front of me.  He started crying.  I awkwardly shoved the ball back onto the stage and he smiled at me, calling me papa.  He beckoned me to come up on stage, and he squirted me in the face with his bottle.

He called out to me several times during the show, but the worst part was when he drove through the theater on a golf cart and made me get onto it with him.  They took me backstage, dressed *me* up in a baby suit, drove me across the stage, and then had me push the cart back across the stage in the other direction.

One of the people who was with me later overheard someone in the bathroom explaining to their child that I was one of the performers pretending to be a clueless audience member.  HA!

So, thats my Mystere story.  Actually, thats one of the few things I remember about it, other than I recall enjoying it.  I had seen O before I saw Mystere, and I must say that I preferred O... but Mystere is great, too."
Mystere,"Charging the same prices as when you first opened is not cool, this show is tired, but predictable and somewhat enjoyable if you like the circus. You definitely get more for your money here than at Ka (what a POS that was - reminded me to the TMNT Foot Clan). At any rate, dont pay full price - go to the discounters and pay the cheapest ticket. All of the seats are great seats. Dealing with the mob before and after was a pain and the bathrooms in the joint were oddly undersized for such a large assembly. Lots of makeup, vegas magic, and flamboyant costumes. Make sure you come liquered up and you will have a great time."
Mystere,"i have to admit that i have no idea about the plot at all, even after the show is done, im still clueless about the big snail balloon that they put there. i mean? what happened?

but regardless of the confusion, this show purely entertain its audience. i for once was amused by their cubic guy, bouncing guys, and the babys wry humor performance."
Mystere,"The intro was pretty amazing, my favorite part being the giant baby. He proved to be largely amusing. Pun intended. The music was spectacular. If you have seen a Circe de Soliel before, this one felt pretty long. Most of the show is your usual acrobatic performances with a touch of whimsical for the children. Currently unsure as to what the plot line was supposed to be. I was excited for the giant snail, but it was on stage for five minutes and just rolled around. This would be great to bring your children to, and a wonderful introduction to Circe de Soliel."
Mystere,"After seeing KA (my first Cirque du Soleil show), this was a major disappointment.  It doesnt come anywhere close to the amazement level of KA.

I blame the producer/director of this show.  As mentioned in some of the other reviews, it is an almost random, incohesive mix of acrobatic stunts and drumming.  There was absolutely no story line to this show.  But beyond just that, several parts were very lull, almost boring.  And then there were parts that (the baby, the old man in the suit) were just simply annoying....and seemed to drag on forever....leaving me thinking come on, get on with the show already....

Another gripe - there is a character (the old man) who comes out and picks on people in the audience, including those in the expensive section.  I can understand having audience participation, but what he does is ridicules and humiliates them.  There is also a baby character that does something similar, but from the stage.  .  Why would anyone want to pay top $$$ for a show to be subjected to that?  It was uncomfortable to watch.

The performers are indeed talented and given a better script, could definitely be put to better use.

How people can see this show more than once is beyond me.  Do yourself a favor &amp; skip this one...."
Mystere,"Finally got to catch a Cirque show in Vegas. This one is chock full of acrobatics and aerials. My favorite performer was the man with the metal cube. There were a few comedic aspects of the show as well. The baby is hilarious. Youll just have to watch it to understand what Im talking about. Id definitely want to catch another one of their shows in the future. Im a fan of the Beatles, so Love would most likely be my next choice."
Mystere,Very impressive acrobatics. The slow times are weird and not that funny.
Mystere,"About 10 years ago we tried to get tickets for O but it was always sold out so we went to see Mystere instead.  That was my first Cirque du Soleil and Ive been a  fan ever since.  
Now that I have a little one I wanted to bring her and see it through her eyes.  Shes only three so she was a little apprehensive at first but she enjoyed it.  The music is very soothing, new age, kind of like Enya.  The costumes are beautifully designed.  The talent and athleticism of these performers are amazing.  The first time I got seats further back and surprisingly I can still see everything really well.  This second time we got really close to the stage and I dont like it as much.  We were only maybe 5 rows from the stage which cause us to look up at some of the acts, my neck got tired.  We could see all the muscles straining and shaking.  Usually really buffed men are not flexible but there is this one act that the two men are not only super strong but they are also human pretzels.  Its circus acts done with a beautiful flare, the music, the colorful costumes and the gracefulness and ease that they seem to have...you will love it.
We got our tikets on the same day at one of those Half off tickets place and saved money so try that."
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show. Was probably back in 2005 or so when I first watched it. Ive seen it twice, and both times it was amazing! The cast of characters and artists were just phenomenal. Just the right amount of humor mixed in with amazing feats that will make you jittery in your seat! The instrumentals and vocals are BRILLIANT. The soundtrack is definitely a must if you enjoy this kind of music!"
Mystere,"The show was pretty good despite the fact that I was as sick as a dog that day. My boyfriend took me to go watch the show on our anni. Since were locals, we got a local discount...yay!! Ok back to the show, the show was funny and it knows how to interact with its audiences. The music and sound effects correlates with the scenes. Though the only thing I was confused about was..I personally did not understand what the storyline was. Overall it was a fun show to see."
Mystere,"I thought Mystere was as good a show as O, better than La Reve.  The feats were amazing (including the strong men!)  It practically doesnt seem real, and the night flew by.  Felt like a kid at the circus for the first time:  pretty much on the edge of my seat."
Mystere,"I held out of the Cirque Hype for a while.  I mean I didnt want it to be another River Dance.  You remember the Dance that swept the country like wild fire!  It wasnt as cool as we all thought, and suddenly who even remembers the Lord  right?  Well, still going stong is the Cirque!  So I thought I am going to check it out...!  And on my last trip to Vegas, I finally started with the one that started it all...MYSTERE!  Let me tell you, its worth all the HYPE!  Yup, I have to admit, I was completely entertained, amazed, laughter, and left in awe, when I walked out!  I couldnt believe what the human body was capable of!  I have to recomend this show!  5 Stars!  See it, and you wont believe it, even after you seen it!!!"
Mystere,"I have never been to a Cirque du Soleil before and we went to Mystere last night night.  It was funny, breathtaking and surreal all at the same time.  The performers were out of this world talented.  I would love to see it again!"
Mystere,"Great time, great show. This show is more circus acrobats. Its not like a story like the House of Ka at MGM. The pre-show was definitely way more entertaining than at the MGM but Ill let you find out for yourself."
Mystere,Mystere is a good starter for this type of entertainment. Seeing O and jubilee before I feel that those were on a grander stage with more difficulty. My in laws and wifey enjoyed the show bc it is their first. 4 stars bc I notice someone mess up and someone pop out of the snail to undo a safety wire. Also too much walking around doing nothing. Learn that from ABDC. Haha.
Mystere,"Too bad this show is in Treasure Island but the show is spectacular! Everything was so colorful, funny, breathtaking, and amazing. I wouldnt mind seeing this show again. My friends and I had seen Zumanity earlier in the weekend and felt like we had completely lost our money so we decided to see and actual Cirque show. This was def. the right pick!"
Mystere,Ive never been to a Cirque show before. I definitely was impressed. Ive seen shows with similar apparatus but the choreography was amazing and the live music was fun. We got tickets like an hour before the show and were in the 8th row. Get there early though! I heard they resell your tickets if your late!
Mystere,"Magical Mystere! We loved this performance! Music was phenomenal. Elements of humor, mixed with ballet, acrobatics, trapeze and gymnastics. Who knew bodies could bend like that?"
Mystere,"Our first Cirque de Soleil show.  It was great.  Its amazing how these people can move.  There were some funny parts to it and the music was great.  I never knew that music can make a show more remarkable.

I would suggest asking the box office when the pre-show begins.  There is a character named Brian Le Petit who does corny stuff, but funny to selected members of the audience."
Mystere,Saw this show on my honeymoon. I had seen a couple Cirque shows before and dragged my new husband along.  After seeing the show my husband is now a huge fan.  Weve been to 4 since this one.  Hes hooked.
Mystere,"I probably would have given it more had I not been so tired from all the walking and the huge meal I had at the Bellagio Buffet. The theatre was big and well decorated. Seating was great too with plenty of leg room. As for the show, what more can you ask for with those amazing acrobats and the humor with some of those characters. Was hoping to see O or KA, but Mystere is still a good show."
Mystere,Ive seen lots of Cirque shows. Mystere is my favorite so far. It has humor and really a fun show to watch. It is not as serious as other Cirque shows.
Mystere,"This is the best of the Cirque Vegas shows weve seen. It was absolutely incredible! These are top notch performers, brilliant music, dazzling sets and costumes... Really, its an incredible spectacle. I would recommend this one for kids too. I would gladly see Mystere again."
Mystere,"Ive always wanted to watch Cirque du Soleil shows but never got around to it, but I got to see TWO this time :)  I had originally booked tickets to Love only but I saw there was a summer special going on and booked tickets for Mystere 2 days before leaving to Las Vegas... Our $50 dollar tickets were awesome!  We were so close to the show.  Mystere turned out to be really entertaining and funny!  Watching it alone made me want to watch all the Cirque du Soleil shows!"
Mystere,"As with all Cirque du Soleil shows, the performance and acrobats are amazing in Mystere.  The setting is not as impressive as the other shows, though, and the baby act was not interesting to our group at all.  However, the variety of shows is what makes Cirque du Soleil so popular.  I agree with Anita L. -- if this is your first experience with CDS, make it Mystere and you wont be disappointed."
Mystere,"I saw this show last year and loved it. At the time the tickets were half off, Or buy one get one free(Theyre the same thing). The discount was for locals. They have that for alot of shows, you just gotta ask and see if the specials are going on. The show was amazing. Worth every penny. It is one of the older cirque shows but still worth catching."
Mystere,"I have to give it a 4 just for the sheer impressiveness of what these people can do.  The way they contort their bodies and the amount of strength they possess in order to do what they do is mind boggling.  However, I was pissed that we bought the most expensive tickets and the ticket person failed to mention that we would be sitting in folding chairs in front of a railing.  That is ridiculous in my book.  Plus I thought the show was good but it didnt hold my attention the entire time in order to warrant 5 stars."
Mystere,"This was the very first Cirque show I went to, almost 10 years ago and its still my favorite.   I remember sitting there after it was over feeling like I just saw something enchanting, almost magical.  It was like nothing I had ever seen before.  The blend of acrobatics, theater and music was beautiful, I still listen to the CD and picture the show in my head.  The costumes are fascinating, and its obvious that a lot of thought went into creating them to compliment whatever the performer needed to do.  Its awesome!"
Mystere,This was my first Cirque show and we sat in the very back row.  I remember it being pretty cool and worthwhile.
Mystere,How anyone could give this show less than a 5 is beyond me.  This was one of the best shows I have ever seen in my life!  There is so much talent and so much to look at.  I loved how they incorporated the audience into parts of the show too.  We had fantastic seats that I think helped with the great experience.  I highly recommend this for everyone!!  I want to see them all now!
Mystere,"This is my favorite Cirque show. Ive seen it 4 times. 

Worth every penny, if youre going to see a cirque show, SEE THIS ONE!!!

It has the best acrobats of all the shows and a little less storyline. A perfect mix."
Mystere,"This hotel got so lucky with this show. I love this show, its freaking nuts, so many things happening, it is awesome, everyone needs to watch this, this is cirque de soleil at its best."
Mystere,"This is for people who have never seen Cirque du Soleil and are wondering if they will like it.  If you need a plot, dialogue, or anything like that, dont go see Cirque du Soleil.  Yes, its beautiful and its cool when they do the acrobatics, but theres not much else to it.  This one in particular, I feel is a bit trippy.  Its actually the one featured in Knocked Up if youve seen that movie.  Anyways, try as hard as I could, I couldnt stay awake and kept dozing off.  I felt really bad because my boyfriend spent a lot on the tickets too."
Mystere,Ive seen Kooza and Ovo in my hometown and they were awesome. So why not see the Cirq. while in Vegas. The tickets were more expensive because you had to buy them from the Treasure Island site. Total price for 2 was $237 after tx and fees. The thing i noticed right away was that the performers werent nsync with their moves. In the previous performance i saw the performers moves were tight. We couldnt really grasp the story. Baby loses her ball? but didnt know how that tied into the other performers they had on stage. The rooster was awesome. The stunts were ok. My husband and I left wanting more and I regretted spending that much money on this show. Its good for someones first Cirque du Soleil performance but not for those who seen other traveling shows. Also there is no intermission.
Mystere,"Amazing show worth every penny.  Tickets were under $100 4 rows from the stage.  After price shopping for the different Cirque du Soleil shows this was one of the more reasonable ones.  $300 for O at Bellagio is ridiculous.  I can make my own O in my bed.  Unlike Laura b., however,  my manatee can definitely contort her fatty rolls around the sack."
Mystere,"The original Cirque Du Soleil was AWESOME and with every copy it goes down in quality a notch. Ugh. Fun amusing evening, but just...ok. Kinda like the Monte Carlo and Paris on the Strip, the originals are better."
Mystere,"This was a beautiful, exciting, wonderful show to watch! It was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I am glad I chose this one! The stunts are impressive, the actors are beautiful, the sets are astonishing. The boy and I got row AA, section 204, seats 4 and 5 which were the best we could have possibly asked for. they were the first row of the upper seats, and though there were actually 3 seats in our row, the 3rd seat (#6) was slightly separated from us, so it was like we had our own little private area. If you can get those seats I would definitely get them if there are just 2 of you! It was great that we were in the upper section also because we are fairly introverted people, and a LOT of people in the front sections get harassed by the actors. The theatre is small and cozy, so being further back is NOT a disadvantage. I think you can actually see more because there is so much going on up above you! 

My only disappointment was the part of the show I have heard so much about and was looking forward to was not performed! I have heard there is a scene where two men do all sorts of crazy lifts that require almost inhuman amounts of strength. I bought the programme and even saw pictures of it in there! But alas, the performance didnt happen. The end also seemed a little awkward, very abrupt. We were both surprised when they started bowing and the lights came up. We both thought maybe something happened back stage and they just cut the show off. But then again, maybe were crazy. Overall, INCREDIBLE. Highly recommended for all ages and interests! The boy is not really into the arts, but enjoyed the show just as much as I did. Were already planning on seeing Ka the next time were in town!"
Mystere,Wow. It really was worth all the hassle that goes along with getting cirque de soleil tickets.
Mystere,"After seeing all the other Cirque shows in Vegas first, I was a little let down by Mystere.  Dont get me wrong, its still a good show.  It just cant compare side by side to O or Ka with their higher tech stages.  The performers were great but halfway through the show I got tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  See this first...then see the other shows."
Mystere,UNBELIEVABLE! Not a bad seat in the house. Cannot wait to see another Cirque show!
Mystere,"Mystere was way better than I expected. I couldnt quite grasp the concept and the adult dressed as a baby kind of creeped me out, but the acrobatics, stunts, music, costumes, moving stage, choreography, lighting and makeup were so amazingly impressive that I didnt care about the concept or the freaky baby. I was mesmerized. I cant wait to attend another Cirque du Soliel show and I am so grateful to have such a fabulous production company here in Las Vegas."
Mystere,My second favorite show in town (second to Ka).  Amazingly talented performers and surprisingly funny.
Mystere,"ew.

i did not like the grown man dressed up as a fat baby, the giant smiling snail, teletubby-like things, or the 2 faced cone-heads.  

i was disturbed and confused for majority of the show.  the colors were beautiful but the acts were very choppy and uninspired. 

HOWEVER, i must give props to the two men who displayed some Hercules-like strength.  their acts kept me from walking out of the theatre.

if you want to see a cirque show, i highly recommend KA or O."
Mystere,"Beautiful choreography, acrobatics, music, and costume. 
Incredibly artistic."
Mystere,"I LOVE cirque du Soleil and this is one of their best shows (O is a bit better).  If you get there 15 min or fewer before the show you run the risk of being used as a prop. Same is true for those folks in the first couple of rows.  The nice thing though is that they do things for the 15 min before -- keeping you entertained.  The comic relief it much better than Ka and O. But, it gets a little tiring.  Plus, often when there is tumbling there is so much going on you cant see it all.  It was really amazing though -- seriously incredible dancers, acrobats, and performers.  I cant wait to see it again!"
Mystere,"Im neutral on this one.  This is my 2nd review with 3 stars because 3 stars is normally not helpful - most of the places Ive been would be 3 stars and not worth doing a review.  The show was good.  Its a glamorous circus with some impressive performances you would expect.  If you are deciding on which show to watch in Vegas, I recommend you keep looking.  I chose this one because we were staying in Treasure Island."
Mystere,"Alright, so heres the deal. Im trying to explain all the stuff I saw on the show. Heres one little gem:
two muscular guys hold each other while performing amazing feats of strength and grace.

Kinda sounds like Brokeback Mountain, doesnt it?

Heres another:
a trapeze artist dances in the air with a big metal cube thingie

Wow, what imagery!

So, sorry, I cant really explain what I saw without going into painful detail. Mystere is basically a collection of circus acts showing some amazing human feats. Its the kind of thing that looks easy because the good ones make it look easy.  Stringing the show together is an Einstein looking ringmaster who acts as comic relief and woman dressed up as a fat baby who is also comic relief.

Go to the website and see some of the images and descriptions. If youve never been to one of these shows before, youll almost definitely be amazed. The real question is whether its worth the price of admission. If you think a $75 dollar ticket requires a life changing experience that will make you think this is proof that theres a God, youll probably be disappointed. But if you want to see a cool circus act with live music that has a great pace, youll be satisfied. Its a 90 minute show, but it doesnt feel long. 

Oh, get there early unless you want to be part of the show...

4/5. I wish they had better food. And whats with the big snail thing at the end? And yeah, I wish it went on for another half hour."
Mystere,Excellent. This is the first cirque production I saw. I saw it many times and am still fascinated by it. I would see it again! Go and see it. You will love it!
Mystere,"Mystere was my first Cirque show ten years ago. I went back for the first time last Wednesday night. It wasnt as exciting as Id remembered, but I think thats because Cirque has rolled out so many over-the-top shows that take your breath away with dramatic music, daring acrobatics and crazy moving sets (like Ka, O, La Nouba). This is really a great show if you like audience interaction. The muscle men are amazing. The baby is funny. Acrobats are great. But if you are looking for action-packed, exhilarating Cirque that makes your eyes dart and your chest thump, go to O or Love or Ka."
Mystere,"Amazing. Well worth the money. We sat up high and center and could see everything.
I couldnt keep my mouth closed and kept hitting my gf going did you see that!
It was super weird, and super fun, and very entertaining. I would say its a little scary to take young kids to though.
Go see it!"
Mystere,I love Cirque du Soleil. Mystere was fantastic show.
Mystere,"The best show I have ever seen in my life.  Better than Ka, a lot better than O.  I wont say anymore because I dont want to build your expectations too high.  It is awesome."
Mystere,"I saw another cirque show under the gran chapeau (tent) near the stadium (qualcom) years ago and it was incredible.  Took my gf to LV and with purchase of two tix got second night at Treasure Island free. Shows only description is incredible. My gf was pissed off because they apparently charge for programs...hard to figure out what a program could tell you anyway.  I think all of the shows are similar, and enjoyable.I actually feel like i got my ninety five dollars worth.........."
Mystere,"Great Cirque show, funny.  We sat in the 3rd row and quite frankly farther back would have been easier on our necks and cheaper.  My kids loved it to."
Mystere,Cirque du Soleils Mystere is an amazing show for all ages.  The performers catered to everyone - young and old.  The fat baby kept everyone laughing while the performers bewildered the audience as to the complexity of their acts.  There is something Magical about watching Mystere - maybe in the way everything is choreographed together.
Mystere,I have not seen anything like this before. This show is the best show by cirque du soleil. I personally would like to watch it one more time if I get the chance. I encourage every one to see this show. I gave it 5 stars with no hesitation.
Mystere,"An intriguing blend of beauty and strength, power and grace, passion and precision...A dreamy, trippy show where vivid colors and spectacular acts of acrobatics blend your dreams with your nightmares. I definitely liked it when I saw it a couple years ago, even if I preferred their shows like LOVE. But now, Cirque du Soleil is doing a promotion where you can bring a friend to the show for only $25 (compared to the suggested price which is around $150) and you can find the deal at http://www.destinationcoupons.com. I think that is just too good of an offer to pass up for such an amazing show!"
Mystere,"it was kinda funny and just like other Cirque du Soliel, performers are good on acrobatic stuff,  their acrobatic performances isnt much different from the Dralion though, but they day we went they had some problems, so all the people that wanted to see the show had to fall in line for over an hour, it was soo delayed and we didnt have any  idea what was the reason, ouch my foot/leg."
Mystere,"We chose this one among all the other Cirque du Soleil shows due to its moderate cost and awesome reviews. Afterwards, we all agreed it was a great deal ($89 each for category 2 seating)...This was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I loved it. The themes were a bit odd, but fun. It was definitely a feast for the eyes--the lighting, colors, and acrobatics. The music was spectacular, as well. You felt transported into another world and totally enchanted by the performance. I highly recommend this show for a night out in Vegas."
Mystere,"We love cirque du soliel and think this one is the best. The venue is small so you can see all the performers. Other cirque venues are so large your head is spinning trying to watch everything. We had 3rd row center seats. It was worth the cost although any seat would be good in this venue. To be able to see the performers faces in this show and really see their magnificent bodies move is the best. If you need over the top huge go to another cirque. If you go to see the human body close up perform at its peak,start with Mystere.  This is something every trip to LAs Vegas should include."
Mystere,"We were just in Vegas and saw 4 shows: Mystere, Le Reve, O and Criss Angel-Believe. Mystere was by far the best! Maybe not the most theatrically intricate etc, but definitely the most entertaining."
Mystere,"This was the first Cirque du Soleil show that I ever saw. And boy I have to say, it really lives up to your expectations and is worth the price that you pay.

The kind of acrobatics that you get to see leaves you with a mouth open... I cannot pick which of the demonstrations was my favorite. They all were awesome. Plus the orchestra was mindblowing. I really enjoyed the background music... 

The clowns, especially the fat man dressed like a baby gets annoying.. But I understand that these are fillers to give the artists time to breathe before their next stage appearance.

This sure is a must-see in Vegas + its more pocket friendly than O or KA."
Mystere,"This was my first Cirque show, and I went on to see 10 more because I loved it. 

Its timeless and tickets can sometimes be found at Tix for Tonight."
Mystere,"Seemed a bit long to me, and not consistently thrilling, but the two strong men were awesome, and the whole family enjoyed it, so four stars for being an excellent family outing with something for everybody.  My niece liked the clown and the baby the best, others liked the strong men and the trapeze acts.  We had the TI buffet added on, which I wont review separately, but that was also a good call to precede the show, and the free tram to the Mirage volcano eruption to follow it!"
Mystere,The show was good. Although the big baby is a bit creepy he was hilarious. Unfortunately this wasnt the first show i have seen so I wasnt as amazed as i wouldve been if it was my first show.  We sat towards the middle section which great view. If you are there early you can get dicounted tickets at the booths along the strip.
Mystere,"Worth the money paid!  Seen it 3 times with different people with me each time, all were amazed and entertained well.  Yeah!  I guess after seeing it many times, I come to retire."
Mystere,"Not my favorite show on the strip.  I had little expectations from the show and hadnt read reviews prior so luckily my expectations were low otherwise I would have been very dissappointed.  The theatre is nice but you can tell this is one of the older shows on the strip.  Pre-show was entertaining with the show performer running through the audience like other Cirque shows.  Overall I did not think the performers were as good as in other shows.  Often times I was really distracted by how off and out of sync the performers were in what could be really cool acts (the part where they climb the poles.  The whole fat man baby thing was entertaining at first but got really old and annoying really fast.  The coolest act to me was the hot guy with the giant cube, very impressive.  During the big gymnastics part across the entire stage it looked like they just brought in pieces from a local gym that didnt fit the asthetic of the stage or the show at all and took away from the show.  When the final number came up I thought to myself, that was it, none of the acts really wowed me the way I anticipated and was often bored during a lot of parts (the dancing couple, fat man baby).  Id suggest seeing another show on the strip or check this one out if you get a good deal."
Mystere,"This is the first cirque show ive ever watched, and far and away my favorite. It may not be as beautiful or artsy as the others, but it is definitely the most entertaining and contains the most acrobatics."
Mystere,"Our first Cirque Show and wont be the last. Truly amazing and visually stunning re-invention of the standard Circus show, yes its all there from the clown (beware the audience interaction Papa!), to trapeze and some Chinese circus pole acts, although the highlight to me has to be the two strongmen, Im still in awe of these guys, they were amazing! one tip would be not to sit to close to the front as a little further back gives a far better view of all the action. Would happily see the show again"
Mystere,"i thought this was a pretty good cirque show and this was my 6th. i rank mystere higher than o. probably because we were seated 5th or 6th row.  i am utterly still in awe of the part where it was the 2 very strong men act.  all, i mean ALL of the performers (well, except for the baby) were in fantastic shape and looked like they were having fun, a true cirque du soleil atmosphere, as when i get when we go see the travelling shows.  i would recommend mystere to anyone who has not seen a cirque show.  and would recommend it over o."
Mystere,This is about the ticketing process. If you buy online you have to wait in same line as the ticket sales so be prepared to wait a long time. I wouldnt do this again.
Mystere,"This is the show that started it all - my love for all things Cirque du Soleil, and my quest to see every show they will ever produce.  Before the company took over almost all entertainment in Las Vegas, there was Mystere at the Treasure Island.  Quite simply, it brought me into its magical world and Ive never left it.  The beautiful costumes and make-up, the hypnotic music, and just the sheer talent of the performers.  This isnt the circus of your childhood.  There are no animals.  The clowns dont make balloon dogs.  This is a visionary wonder of grown-up dreams that become reality on stage.  The grand finale with the taiko drums will send chills up your spine as the rumble fills the theater.  I often wish that I could tip a guard to sneak me into the last 5 minutes of the show, just for the drum part.  Over the years, I admit, other Cirque shows have surpassed Mystere, which at times seems simple now, but this show has a special place in my heart as the start of it all for me."
Mystere,"I am writing this for those parents looking for stuff to do with kids.  While expensive, this show is definitely worth it.  We took our 4 and 1 year olds here and they were totally occupied from the minute we sat down.  From the pre-show guy going around in the audience, to the dude dressed up as a baby, to all of the acrobats, they loved it.  My wife and I really enjoyed it as well as did our 16 old niece.  Dont miss.  Oh, and there ARE NO BAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE as far as we could tell, so dont pay over the top for seats up close."
Mystere,"Hated O, LOVED Mystere.  Its as if since Mystere was the first Cirque show in Vegas, they took all of the acts and decided which ones were the best and put them into Mystere.  The later shows, although bigger, cant compare with Mysteres overall excitement and fun."
Mystere,"We were bedazzled with the first show we saw- Kooza (near our hometown)- and instantly fell in love with Cirque du Soleil.  We thought Mystere would have the same height of entertainment value, but was below average.  The visuals and music were spectacular! I love the drums, but other than that, the rest of the performance was dull and seemed to dragged on.  I was especially bored by the air acrobatics and the see-saw segment.  i yawned and nearly dozed off.  There were a few mistakes, but hey who said it had to be perfect.  No stars were knocked off for that.  What bothered me the most, and why I had to take off more stars were the embarrassment of the audience.  Okay I completely understand that they want participation from the viewers, and half of it was fine and funny.  The other half-- not so great!  I felt sorry for people who had popcorn dumped on their head or tossed at, or had champagne (or whatever it was in the bottle) splashed on them.   I was extremely glad I sat far back, which by the way was still in good viewing without the neck strain and cheaper tickets too!"
Mystere,"We went to the Tix 4 Tonight booth at the Fashion Show mall to get our discounted tickets to Mystere.  Im really glad we didnt buy full price tickets, but I am glad that we saw the show.  It wasnt bad... it was just... semi-boring in a lot of places.  Very old school Cirque du Soleil, which I knew going in, but coming right off of seeing KA, it just paled that much more by comparison.  Mystere has some good sections to it, but not enough to hold your attention throughout the entire show.  I cant even count how many people I saw moving about the theater during the show.  The two guys doing their strength acrobatics was impressive, as was the acrobatics up and down the poles by the legion of men in the show, but that was about it.  Smoke and lights and old circus acts fill up the rest of the show....  Still, if youre wanting that kind of a show, go see Mystere.  Its not all bad."
Mystere,"Saw this show 3 times within 5 years still love it and enjoy. This is the original Cirque du soleil show all my friends love it, fast and exciting all times worth ur money."
Mystere,"As expected from Cirque, the acrobats were amazing.  I could not get enough of the strength and flexibility and beautiful costumes.  I would have given 5 stars for the incredible performance and wonderful music - but, I just could not get with the basic story line.  I can never follow the Cirque storylines, and know that isnt really the point of the show - but this one had a truly obnoxious gentleman who started out the show by annoying guests and generally being a pain.  I suppose some people find this funny, I was just thinking that if he had come near me, I might have had to punch him.  Then, there is an obese man in the show who plays a creepy baby.  In general, I am not a fan of adults in diapers - and all I could think about was - wow, these Cirque acrobats much train constantly, watch what they eat, and just really be disciplined about their art.  And then, there is this huge fat guy who is part of the cast?  What does he do all day when theyre training?  Is it weird for him to be in the same cast as these people?  Anyway, it was all quite distracting and very uncomfortable.  But, Im sure if I read through all these reviews there would be people who thought this guy was genius, so to each his own.  But, I do recommend the show for the acrobats. And the huge snail, which some people might have also found creepy.  And I definitely recommend getting tickets at the Half-Price Tix box office - not a bad seat in the house and youll save 20-40% day of.  PAPA!!!!!!!!"
O,"What a phenomenal show. As expected of a cirque du soleil show, the acrobatics were amazing. But its not the acrobatics alone that made the show.  The entire set design, music, and choreography together transformed the show into something magical. The stage alone was modern marvel, switching back and forth from a deep reservoir of water to a platform for acrobatics.  The only part I didnt quite care for was the comic relief bits between the acrobatics, presumably to give them time to set up the next act.  But Im sure the kids in the crowd enjoyed it.

Along with Ka, this has been the best show in Vegas."
O,"Im going to start by saying it was blah.  The clown skit was totally stupid and didnt fit into the whole act.  If I wanted to see clowns I would have went to Penn and Teller. 

Yeah lots of acrobats above water.. Yawn yawn.  

Best parts were when they had a diving competition and watching the singers and band thru the windows.  Too bad they were hidden.  

When the performance was over there wasnt a thank you for coming or nothing. Lights came on and it was a push your way thru the waiting crowd to get out.  

Wife has wanted to see it... And even she was bored."
O,"Exciting, amazing show.
I was really looking forward to seeing this show  O .
I chose somehow  wheelchair seat , on the seat said, I didnt know, but in the middle and in the front of the stage, it was perfect, my seat was 203 P 1.

Performance were excellent, I kept crying every single action/ theme.
Some performance were very funny, I laughed so loud.
Well trained. 
They gave me lots of energy and made me feel There are nothing impossible.
I will recommend to my friends in Hawaii,"
O,"First time watching the show O we ended up getting tickets to this show when we were in Vegas and it was one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen. Hands down it was beautiful, artsy and man soo much work was done to do this show. I really applaud all the hard work that everyone has to do for this show every night. 

I have heard so many people say this is their favorite Vegas show and well I can see why now. I was amazed the entire show and it was just amazing, amazing and for sure a must go!!!!! 

It is a bit pricy but very understandable after you see what is done in the show. Got tickets pretty close to the front but I really think almost any seat you will be able to see the performance. 

Dont want to spoil anything about the show but will say this is a much needed show to watch. Even for people that dont really like watching shows, I still would think that youll find it fascinating."
O,"We saw the show Jan 2020 and had great seats, 2nd row just off center. Now I will say you may actually want to be back further to take in this spectacle and all that goes on! I cannot recommend or say enough good things about 0. To me it is the quintessential Cirque du Soleil show....If youve seen one before or not seen one yet...SEE THIS ONE! It is just WONDERFUL. I will be honest and say I cannot make any sense of the story line...I cant in several of their shows...thats not what I go for. The sheer artistic madness, athletic chaos, insane props, gorgeous costumes....OVERWHELMING. I am shocked to read reviewers complain about either the high price of the tickets or the show being boring...wrong and wrong...we paid $143. each plus fees and by the first quarter of the show I whispered the comment to my friend I would gladly have paid TWICE AS MUCH...so please...trust my highest recommendation of this fantastic and now iconic Vegas show!"
O,"My bf and I went to Las Vegas and we decided to see a show! Luckily, we found a pretty good deal on the Bellagio website. It was a 20% summer discount from regular tickets. However, we were seated in the limited viewing section - 101. In my opinion, it wasnt bad but if I were to choose a better location, 200s area is where you get the best views of the stage. 

Make sure you buy the tickets in advance because when we asked if they had any available tickets the same night, they told us it was sold out! We got the 9:30PM time however, theres another showing time at 7PM. 

I was also surprised with the comedic effect of their performances and I loved it! The additions of water and fire elements made the show even more enjoyable. The only down side was there wasnt a set plot to the show. At certain parts, I was confused with the acts but in the end, it was still a great experience and show! I highly recommend taking the time to watch a show in Vegas and especially, the O at the Bellagio!"
O,"This was my second cirque show. This one was a story with crazy acrobats mixed in. Very different than my first experience. It was amazing. The floor being a pool was mind blowing. It constantly changed from a pool , to a shallow pool to a floor which was amazing within itself. The people are very talented and kept us intrigued. The clowns were cute and funny in the beginning and slowly became boring and almost didnt fit in the story. They were very talented but what they were saying/doing was confusing. I would recommend to see this show while in Vegas. It was amazing and the water really set it apart from all the other shows. True talent!"
O,So good. So good. So good. Dats it. Dats all you need to know. A magical and visually stimulating (borderline overwhelming - in the best way!) show from start to finish. We sat smack in the middle of the 2nd row and were worried about getting wet. These comments made me think Id feel like I was getting off a water ride by the end of the show but it wasnt that way at all. At most I felt a few droplets on my arm. Youll feel mist a time or two but thats it. If you can sit under these performers left armpit WHY NOT? DO IT!! Would see this again in a heartbeat and would try to sit in the front row if I could - I like being called on stages lol. But if youre not in the very front row dont fret about them trying to get you on stage. Theyve got a job to do and begging you to come on stage isnt part of it lol.
O,"Recently came to Las Vegas to catch this show with the wifesky.

Easy to find within the Bellagio Hotel.

We pre-purchased our tickets ahead of time and printed them out so all that was needed was to walk up to the ushers and have them scan us in. 

Prior to the entryway to the theater, theres a store for collectibles for purchase along with a concession stand for food and drinks.

Once you approach the entryway into the theater, youll encounter more friendly staff wholl direct to your specific row and seating assignment as per your tickets.  Even if you dont remember their directions, the sections, rows and seat numbers are easy to see providing you get there early enough before the show starts.

As you enter the theater, I was immediately enraptured and awestruck by the beautiful and dazzling ceiling artwork.
Seating was comfortable including the temperature of the interior.  Gangways between seats were spacious and roomy that allowed fellow patrons to pass on their way to their seats without incident.

Once the show started along with the air acrobatics, it was a sight to see plus the fact that beneath the stage is all a pool of water which was highly utilized for the performance including the synchronized swimming acts.
Most impressive was all the moving parts - under the stage (water), on stage (at eye level), and from above as well.  It was visually stunning.

The dazzling costumes along with their intricate and ornate designs were also impressive particularly made for the pool/water work and for above stage as well. 

The special aerial feats were stunning and breathtaking -- in the air above the stage coupled with the diving into the water below.

The performance also conjures up a mix of emotions - one minute happiness based on whats occurring on stage, and next minute sadness, and next anger but I must take a star away as the entire show didnt appear to have a theme or allegory attached to it (-1) so difficult to find a story in there but visually stunning nonetheless.

If ever youre in Vegas, you really shouldnt miss this show.  Its a must recommend.  
The wifesky and I do plan on returning to catch other Cirque Du Soleil shows so stay tuned for those reviews."
O,"This is my second time watching O at the bellagio and its a beautiful show. The music is also very beautiful. 
First time, i sat in the front before and was unable to take in the fullness of the show... thats bc youre kind of watching it straight on. 
This time around, I actually sat in the last row on the balcony and saw everything from like an aerial view, which was cool, but the performers are tinyyyyyy and there is this BRIGHT GLARING LIGHT from the stage that shines directly into your eyeballs for nearly half of the show. My friends and I were shielding our eyes for a good part of it. (Eventually 3 of them fell asleep, so I guess that solved the problem for them.) 
There is no real story line but the background, performers, etc are all excellent. 
Its easy to find the theater in the bellagio. There is a bathroom right outside the theater and several bathrooms inside (including one on the balcony floor). You can also purchase popcorn and drinks in the lobby and take it into the theater. 
A lot of people line up to get in. Check the front tho since some people just funnel to one set of doors, when there are two sets of doors taking people in. 
The show for us didnt start on time as they have a bit of clown time in the beginning so its a bit forgiving if you are late. 
Lastly, dont be that person taking photos or videos during the show. Youre not allowed to and if you try to, the attendants start flashing this blue light at you, which distracts everyone else in the audience near you too."
O,"I really wanted to be blown away and overall it was a solid show. But I still cant belive that I spent that much money on a show like that. Everything wAs top of the line. 

The humor in th show was superb and you cant deny the athleticism  actors and acrobatics. I just wish this show head focused squarely on the acrobats and the stage that was a pool sometimes.

I say that because I feel like there were other things going on on the acrobat pieces were happening kind of deflecting from them just a bit. When I say other things I mean random other things like people dancing in the background I feel like a show this solid has enough to stand on and there are acrobat ask happening that  needs to be the main focus.

I also really like how they sell popcorn outside of the theater and you can bring it into and  enjoy,  especially since the show is an hour and a half. I really did enjoy everything this show had to offer. I would recommend it as well."
O,"Hated it. Boring, the skits werent funny. Not impressed at all. Save your money.
Very dissapointing. Couldnt wait for it to be over."
O,"WORTH EVERY PENNY.

This is what Ive been telling everybody! Worth every single freaking penny!

I was seated around 10 rows from the front and oh boy that was the best decision Ive ever made. I was upclose with the entire production and my mouth was wide open with certain acts/scenes. They were that crazy and amazing!

My favorite acts were the (1) Russian Swing and (2) High Dive. Perfection at its finest. The curtain call made me feel emotion Ive never felt before lol I found it so cool!!

Kudos to every single performer for making my Vegas trip amazing. Such great talent!!

Venue was big! Seats were comfortable. Everybody left happy, stunned, amazed and uncomfortably untalented lol

You guys are the best!!!! I will bring more family members next time to see this production again!!! 

5 FREAKING STARS!!!"
O,"I have wanted to see O since I was a child. Over the year, I have seen about a dozen Cirque du Soleil shows and I had often been told that O was the best.
Do not get me wrong, the show is BEAUTIFUL and the performers are amazing- but... it still let me down. 

FIRST, it is very overpriced. For two tickets in the 4th balcony row, we paid a bit over 300$. It was just too expensive.

SECOND,  there doesnt seem to be any good seats. From our section we were lucky enough to be able to see everything that happened in the pool, however I could not see anything at the front of the stage. This seems to be an issue for people who sit at the front as well- they cannot see into the pool.

THIRD, there were not enough acrobatics. The ones that performed were AMAZING... but there were too many clowns and not enough acrobatic acts.

Bottom line: I am glad that I saw it- but I still left disappointed. I much preferred Mystère, Curios, Ovo, etc.
Next time I am in Vegas I will see KA instead!"
O,"What an amazing show! Before our trip, my family and I researched Las Vegas shows and saw that the O show was one of the best. In order to get the full experience, we paid a little extra and sat in the Orchestra section. Im going to be honest, I didnt completely understand the plot, but the action, quality, sound, and performance was absolutely breathtaking! 

Pros:
- Beautiful performance ~ the acrobatics was phenomenal 
- Amazing music 
- Funny ~ there were a few scenes that were funny (the two sailors were so funny)

Cons:
- Expensive 

Overall:
- Cirque Du Soleil - O was an amazing show. While the plot was confusing, the performance and acrobatics was phenomenal and well worth the hefty ticket price."
O,What a great show. Im not sure if the show switches up or stayed the same but talk about keeping you on your toes. There is just so much going on during the entire show. We sat in the second set of seats back and I had no problem seeing the entire stage. I would 100 percent suggest this show to anyone.
O,"I had heard that this was the best Cirque du Soleil show, so I really wanted to see it this time when I was in Vegas. I saw Ka on my last trip and I was a little disappointed. 

O did not disappoint. Its the most expensive Cirque show in Vegas and theres a reason. Its a water based show which is really awesome. The synchronized swimming and diving is really impressive. 

This show had way more acrobatics than Ka did which I loved. It was about 2 hours long. Of the three Cirque shows Ive seen (Ka, Corteo, and now O), O was definitely my favorite. 

If you like Cirque shows, I would highly recommend seeing this one!"
O,"This Cirque show is very abstract, which as a dance teacher myself, I can absolutely appreciate. I thought it was creative and it kept you wondering the entire show what was going to come out on stage next. Maybe because I had seen other cirque shows prior to this one, I didnt feel like, other than the water feature, that the acts were that much different. Dont get me wrong, the performers tackle incredible stunts with great energy, but I felt like sometimes the audience was left wanting more of one act and less of others. Anyway, overall it was a great show. This is one of the higher priced tickets for Cirque shows because it is in the Bellagio and the only Cirque water based show. Would I recommend it? Absolutely, just make sure to go into it with a really open mind and try not to focus on finding a story line. I also think I would have liked this one more had I not seen Le Reve first, which is Wynns phenomenal water based show."
O,"This is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show. Ive seen all the Vegas shows, Ive seen this show 3 times and it never gets old. I love how the stage involves water. Its amazing to watch the actors and dancers manipulate their body using water as their medium. My husband was very impressed too and said he would also go to watch again. This show is great! 

However, we did have an slight issue booking. I bought the tickets directly from the Cirque Du Soleil website. But it turns out the website has an error, the day I bought the show for on Mothers Day, apparently the show was closed that day and the actors were taking a break. They informed me of this 1 week after I booked it. Which was enough time for them to rebook me for the next days showing, and they even upgraded our seats. We were happy campers!"
O,"This show was PHENOMENAL! It exceeded my expectations. I have never seen a Cirque du Soleil show so Im very new to this experience. 

Tip: Get there at LEAST 20 minutes before time. Especially if you want popcorn/drinks. 

I had an amazing seat. I was right below the lady who cascades from the ceiling. I was very close to the clowns, they came near us several times. (Section 203, Section P, Row 4). I was dead center to see the entire stage. I would recommend this area. 

You cant take photos because of the danger they present to the actors, but honestly I was hooked into the show. The acrobatics are amazing. The artistry is beautiful. I would 100% recommend seeing this and I would see it again. Maybe the people who didnt like it have seen several shows, but for this to be my first show, it was great. The show was about 1 hour and 30 minutes, not 2 hours like I thought. Some people felt like they couldnt follow the story line, to me it was clear. This guy sees a beautiful girl and follows her through this weird world to find her. 

At the end, they allowed you to take a photo of the cast and then you could buy souvenirs in the gift shop. Go see it. You wont be disappointed."
O,Nice fancy stadium. Had seats in section 200 at the very front. Youll be better off sitting at the top of the stadium which had better view. I felt like its pretty expensive for a show where people swinging around plus with a not so good seat. I didnt get the concept of the story. It was entertaining at first and lost interest when I realized that its pretty repetitive. It was a good experience but will probably wont do it again.
O,"Omg this was our very first Cirques Show weve seen and we are now extremely addicted and must see them all. We had great seats in the second row and didnt get wet at all, not that the performers dont try lol in a great fun manor. It was so exciting and fun to watch those performers are so magical and talented wow we cant stop talking about it. We will definitely be back again and again to see them all."
O,"It really brings me great joy every time I get to write a 5 star review. Id even extend that to 4 star but once you get down to 3, 2 and heaven forbid 1 it becomes progressively more difficult. For the lower starred places, you really have to take the time to describe why they deserve ratings this low. All reviews to some extent are moved by emotions and feelings which is great when it is positive but not particularly helpful to anyone if they are negative. Anyways, O was a solid 5 star experience and Im going to write this for both those who have never been to a Cirque performance before or those who have not seen the O performance.

I remember the first time O was advertised as a performance. I think it was just around the time that Bellagio was built some 20-25 years ago. As a young kid coming to Vegas it was absolutely incredible. Like an adult Disneyland but with more flashing lights than the Electrical Parade. O is the main stage performance at Bellagio and in many ways complements the hotel itself. Its upscale, trendy and all around awe inspiring. Of the Cirque performances, this is the only to my knowledge that uses water as its main stage and how they do it is quite impressive. 

Most people who have not seen a Cirque performance will probably be asking whats the big deal. Theyre acrobats and flexible people but why are they so popular? Each performance is told in a story of some way that has a trajectory but they also take tangents along the way. They take audience members onto the stage injecting humor and sometimes horror (haha) giving a lighthearted approach to a situation that might otherwise be dark. They use clowns (like good clowns and not the scary red haired birthday clowns) to break up the tension that can really hold an audience captive. The music is also amazing and they always manage to pair well with what is going on on stage. Lastly, there is so much going on that youd be entertained from every angle... including the aisles by your seats.

O, like I said, is a water performance. You also have Le Reve at the Wynn which I had gone to almost 10 years ago. Its very different and I enjoyed O much more than Le Reve. Le Reve was predictable. O was not and took the performance in directions that I really was appreciative of. Os stage is a pool... sometimes. Its a pool, then not a pool then a partial pool. Wait is it a pool? Oh, just a wet surface now. The light tricks really keep you going and you think that at many times during the performance that people are walking on water. Yes the acrobatics are incredible as well. How do people do all that? Love the set and the costumes were amazing. If you are looking to be entertained, this is where you should be for a performance. Like Rose V. said Hands down one of my favorite shows ever. I share that same sentiment.

Get your tickets early. My understanding is that each performance will sell out by the time the show starts. Show goes on for about an hour and a half I believe and there are two showings each night. We did the 9:30pm show which allowed us to have dinner or the option of having another show before that. If youre in Vegas and looking for something to do and Celine Dion is sold out or Lady Gaga is too expensive, then O is a fantastic way to celebrate your Vegas vacation."
O,"The worlds top acrobats, synchronized swimmers and divers challenge the limits of peoples imagination with crazy water performances."
O,"MUST SEE!  A million words cannot explain this spectacular show.  It is an absolute must see.  The intense water acrobatics, high flying stunts, and costumes are absolutely breathtaking.  I recommend sitting in the last few rows of the orchestra and not in the first few rows so you get a good aerial view."
O,"Summary: best cirque du soleil show ever! Ive been to every cirque show and I must say that show was hands down better than any other! 

Ambiance: beautiful entry room and the theater hall is just remarkable.... we had side seats like the old muppets critics (Statler and Waldorf???)...lol... we had our own spinny chairs and everything! 

Show: its mostly a water/diving show (same concept as Le Reve. The acrobatics were amazing! These human beings were simply amazing (just realized I said amazing twice ...it was amazing).... pay attention to the music because everything is performed live!!! We could see the singers singing and dancing together and people playing on instruments.... truly state of the art entertainment...

Cost: a little pricey but well worth the price given how good the show is and how expensive other shows are in Vegas in general... plus- youre watching an amazing show with a good story with incredible performances (performers and musicians). We got a little discount because we were guests at the Bellagio (not sure if you have to be a guest but we just asked for a guest discount and got one)....

Conclusion: very similar to Le reve at the Wynn ... I think they shared the same producer or director or created or somebody ... very cool concept as the performances are mostly done in the water with lots of crazy dives! Treat yourself to a good night with some fun and see this show!"
O,"This performance is one of the best Cirque de Soleil performances Ive ever seen. The performers are amazing in all aspects. There is synchronized swimming, diving, fire scenes, and of course high flying acrobatics. I dont have any complaints or critiques. Our seats were in the middle and to the left of center stage, but I dont think there is a bad seat in the theater. The theater is beautiful and located in the Bellagio. We purchased tickets the first day we arrived in Vegas since it sells out frequently. We purchased Friday afternoon and attended the 7pm Sunday night show. Add this to your list of things to do in Vegas, and you wont be disappointed."
O,"We saw the O show 15 years ago and loved it. We decided to see it again last week . I was kind of disappointed. It was very long and boring. Yes, acrobatics of the show is amazing, and some of the numbers are good, but I got tired of watching the same thing for two and a half hours. There was no intermission, it was tiring to seat and watch acrobatics without a break. Tickets were expensive, I dont know if the show was worth it."
O,"Show was eh.
Im sure it was impressive in the 90s
Theatre is old
Technology aside from the stage is very old and dated

Seats were old
The theatre exit bottlenecks the entire audience for 5 minutes of more 
You have to deal with drunk brits wanting to fight in line
I was worried about pickpockets exiting
Ka is better"
O,Really great show. A good view from any seat or placement. I would highly recommend this show based on sound and delivery. A little pricey for good seats so be prepared.
O,"Wonderful 
Brilliant 
Captivating 

Yes. I was totally geeked to see this show. The simple fact that it takes place on and in water just blew me away. Like All Cirque Du Soleil shows, audiences are treated to acrobatic genius. You will not be disappointed for sure. The tix is a bit pricey but its sooo worth it. 

Tip - its better to get a seat a little farther away from the stage so you can really appreciate the overall scene."
O,One of my favorite water show next to la Reve. Production was awesome the stunts and the cast was awesome definitely One if the MUST watch shows you need to watch. This one has a smaller stage then then LaReve @ Wynn. But it was still awesome Production and shows.
O,Amazing show we loved it. The guys on the boat are my favorite. The dancers are amazing. 5 stars cant wait to see Ka next I definitely recommend going to see this show. Great for water lovers. The hotel itself was beautiful a lot of great art
O,I am at the show and bored.  The comedy is boring.  My husband wanted to leave by midway.  We stick it out.  Some cool acrobatic and diving but story line is too weak to keep you engaged.  Set was the coolest part.  I personally liked Zumanity better.  Absinthe is still my favorite Vegas show to date.
O,"Unforgettable! First time seeing Cirque Du Soleil and was blown away by the costumes, performances and that STAGE! Seriously how does that thing work? Sat in row 202 and was happy with the seats. Id see the show again in a heartbeat."
O,"The O show is very good. I love water shows and this one is top notch. I would give it 5 stars but putting the O show on the same level as Beatles Love is like giving the Godfather and Little Miss Sunshine the same rating... its just ridiculous.
Go see it and sit close. Its worth the money."
O,"Review for Cirque du Soleil O at Bellagio LV
Sunday, November 18, 2018 @ 7:00pm

I have to be honest with you and say the show starts out somewhat mundane and luster lacking.  As the show progress, I am on the edge of my seat sipping my 32oz O frozen special to calm the fear for O performers!  Now I know why the show is call O.  You cannot give a number rating to something so artistic and death defying!

I am sitting aisle center, 2nd row from the stage, and can see everything.  The slightest miscalculation from performers diving into the stage pool of water will result in serious injury!
 
My apology to performers for running out at the end.  I have to catch the performance of A PERFECT CIRCLE Metal Rock Concert next door at The Cosmopolitan.  I am already missing one of their lineup band.

THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF 
MY NAUGHTY BUT NICE XXX SOCIAL CALENDAR!

My 3rd trip to Las Vegas in 2018. I have now seen ALL 7 x Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas this year alone!"
O,"This show is magical. Pure magic... Ive seen it 3 times and every time its been just as amazing. Something that I love particularly about O is that everyone on stage looks like theyre having a blast (much more intricate than a stage). Every time I see it I wish I could be that high into the air and gracefully flying into the water and had the ability to just swim around underwater for huge amounts of time like a mermaid, lol. Im sure everything is very carefully organized and precisely timed like a perfectly oiled machine but it looks so fun and effortless! 

Im not a big fan of the clown scenes but for clown scenes theyre really good. Not scared of clowns but have never found them particularly amusing or comedic personally. The costumes throughout the show are nice and I feel like they really draw you in to the show better than any other Cirque show does. Ive seen many others but not all yet in Vegas. Ive seen Ka, Zarkana, Mystere (2nd fav so far) &amp; etc. but O is terrific. 

Ive seen it from the lower level in a middle section, up top towards the stage left-middle rows, and to the very far stage right section higher than the bottom section and honestly each section had its perks and advantage so I suggest looking for seats that youll feel comfortable in that are in your price range. I think that overall Ive appreciated being able to see everything that was going on from the mid-high sections though, but everyones preference will be different.

Tip: Dont see O first because it will set your expectations too high for the others. Im sure there are some somewhere that are also terrific but O is just a different level for me than any others Ive seen."
O,"This is a great show in a great theatre in the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. This show has been playing at the Bellagio since October 1998. O is pronounced the same way as eau, the French word for Water and is performed by a Canadian Circus and Entertainment Company. 

I saw this show the first time I think in 2004 and its incredible to say the least. I have seen a number of the Cirque Du Soleil productions and this is one of my favorite. I was cheap the first time I saw it and purchased nose bleed seats. This time we did the wet seats just a couple rows from the stage near the middle. While Im talking about seats we should discuss prices. Tickets run from about $98 bucks to $300. I dont think they have that many $300 seats because we we like five rows from the stage and our tickets were $174.00 a piece and worth every single cent. 

There has been more than 9,000 performances since it opened and it has grossed well over one billion dollars, pretty impressive. 

It is a water themed production. They are 85 acrobats involved and more than 150 people behind the scenes. Under the movable stage is a 1.5 million gallon pool. Every member of the cast is scuba certified. 

The Bellagio has a wonderful specially climate controlled 1,800 seat theatre. The small size makes just about every seat a good one. My suggestion if you can afford it is to get seats within the first 10 rows. It just makes it a little better. We booked out tickets a couple months in advance to make sure we could get good close seats. 

Im pretty sure I have been to all the Cirque Du Soleil shows here in Las Vegas and this is one of my favorites. 

After the show you can get pictures. It will cost another hundred bucks or so. The pictures are worth it. Every time I look at them I think about the show and the beautiful moments their spent with my wife. 

If you only have time for one show in Vegas, this on at the Bellagio is the one you should see. Just a note, they do not allow you to photograph during the show and the couple people I saw they were stopped immediately and if you continue they will ask you to leave. Its for the safety of the cast. What they do is extremely difficult and the flashes could throw them off. There are certain times they will allow for photographs. 

Its an amazing show in an amazing theatre in an amazing hotel. What more can you ask for?"
O,"Watched the Michael Jackson One Show and it was AMAZING! Great performance for all circus and Michael Jackson fans, young and old. Professional cast and environment free of distractions. Highly recommended!"
O,How do you even describe this show? Just amazing! The athleticism and acrobatics of the performers is breathtaking and matched only by the beautiful choreography.  Its unbelievable once you realize this is all done with a live band too!  As good as it gets!
O,"Great masterpiece! The tickets are a little pricier than those of other Cirque du Soleil shows, but they are worth every dollar."
O,"This is how I imagine a 14th century inspired European Opera house would look like in todays modern age. Among the Cirque Du Soleil shows on the famous Las Vegas Blvd., this show is truly an amazing spectacle at Bellagio! Every scene and performance was visually stunning and mesmerizing especially scenes when the stage would disappear and become a large pool of water then transfer into solid platform again. Water is the main feature of this multi-million dollar production and approximately 1.5 million gallons of water. I personally enjoyed every moment and the musical score complimented each act from beginning to the end. Unique aspect of the show was opening and closing scene that had to do with the red curtains, gives it a Wow factor. 

FYI: It is one of the most watched shows in Las Vegas and I believed its been viewed by 15,000,000 million visitors since 1998. 

Overall, just a fantastic show for all ages and its definitely a bucket list show in Las Vegas

2017 Yelp Review #68"
O,"It helps to know that it is rated number 1 Cirque du Soleil. Compared to the other shows, I just want to let people know that this is longer than most. It is 105 minutes long, instead of the usual 90 minutes. The theater is huge as well, and the production is extravagant. The stage is multi-level, and will primarily be water coming in and out. The show consist of a lot of talents, I recommend sitting at the 200 section due to a lot of activities going on up and down and around the stage. 
This cirque is one of those shows that will truly be appreciated by the art-lover and the performance enthusiast. The quality of the acrobats and the training is truly demonstrated in this show. 
The production and technicality, from stage and lighting and music is superb. I highly recommend to an individual who is at least 12-13 years of age, as I am speaking from if I was that young, I think I would appreciate it. The younger kids may have the tendency to get bored due to the longevity of the show.
Altogether, this show is amazing and a very good show to see while visiting Las Vegas"
O,"I saw the show on Friday March 1st for the first time, I paid $290 for two tickets taxes and fees included. I purchased the tickets from Expedia. The seating chart is not very clear. Our seats were on the front row the very two seats on the left corner with limited view. I complained to the staff and they moved us to couple seats near the stairs which were much better than where we were. I found the show very boring and didnt worth the money. They should have combined other acts besides just diving in the pool twenty different ways. 
Sorry"
O,"Over a decade after experiancing this show the first time, and I can say that a second time was even better. This is honestly one of the best Circ Du Soilel productions. The entire premises of the show is magical. The artistic talent of the aerialists is unsurpassed. However, their fearlessness is something extraordinary. The way they jump into the water gives me butterflies and panic at the same time. Bottom line, if you are planing on watching a show in vegas, then O is worth every single penny."
O,"Dope show. They encourage you to videotape and take pictures. Especially when the performers are 100 feet in the air, doing a flip with no net. JK. They will eject you foo.

Theres some twists and turns and surprises. Its kinda gothic themed. Elements of adult Alice in Wonderland on acid. Def this cirque creator experimented with psychedelics. If heights make you squeamish, then probably not the show for you. A lot of death defying leaps into water. 

The storyline is a bit thin or at least not that obvious. Kinda a spoiler but there are clown bits intermingled throughout the show and I get theyre comic relief bits meant to give the acrobats time to rest, but thats just one example of how it seems like this show is a bunch of random scenes that are loosely tied together. I could have written a good plot and connecting characters and conflict for this show. Email me and Ill pitch an idea.

The set is amazing. Its a water set floor also that can become a hard floor anytime it wants. Which is also scary cause if the floor malfunctioned....

Great costumes too. Live orchestra (hidden) and singers (somewhat hidden). Clown work is phenomenal. The acrobatics and divers though of course top notch."
O,"A lot of people mention O being the Cirque show to watch... or just the show to check out when youre on the Las Vegas Strip. I will say that I respect what each artist does and the show is wonderful in that sense, but it isnt all its hyped out to be in my humble opinion. 

I just think I have a preference in some of the other Cirque shows (Ka and Zumanity being my most recommended), so O did not fit my normal palette. In fact, I found it slightly boring. I didnt quite follow it. I felt it didnt start picking up until mid-way through in my opinion so the first half was yawn fest for me.

That does NOT take away from the fact that everyone who works in the show or behind-the-scenes does a fantastic job every single day! Performances were great - 10/10. I am a fan in the sense that I really do believe that what they do is amazing. 

Each Cirque show has a unique selling point and O is just simply beautiful, but not for me. If you like something with a solid and sensible storyline, see Ka. If you like something more engaging, sexy, truly funny and quirky, see Zumanity. If youre a fan of The Beatles or Michael Jackson, dont miss out on Love or Michael Jackson One. Theres a Cirque show for everyone, but O was, for me, a one-time watch :)"
O,"Incredible!! Of all the the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas, this is the one to see. It is an incredible performance (I had to go home and YouTube how they managed to make the stage work!). Highly recommend."
O,"Ive seen almost all the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas and I would say O is one of the top 3. Everyone is so talented and amazing! I think all the shows are pretty much more or less the same with different story lines/themes. I would recommend seeing this show if youve never seen it. Its a little boring to me but I appreciate the art. Tbh, I prefer Absinthe, which is raunchy and funny."
O,"Fantastic show! One of the best shows I have seen hands down in my entire life. I was experiencing all types of feelings when I was watching this show.

In regards to the location, the Bellagio, the entrance and the ballroom where the show was at was beautiful! Upon the entering, there are multiple statues based on the acrobats, stunts you will see during the show, they are all up for sale. The ballroom is beautiful! Very clean, and is magical, extremely large. You cannot go wrong in choosing your seats, because all of the seats are made to be able to see and enjoy the show. Although, in the front seats, actors tend to come and walk down the corridors. 

Everything is live, including the music, played live, and singers are live! Throughout the entire show, my mouth was hanging open, I couldnt believe all the amazing acts, the way the human body can fold in so many ways. Although, sometimes there is sooo much going on, that I couldnt focus on a single act. Nevertheless, the storyline is beautiful, you experience happiness, laugh, awe and all other emotions!

If you are in Vegas, I definitely recommend this show, it is a must! You will not regret it! I had a blast!!!"
O,"O NO!!! We have seen every Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas and they are ALL better than this bore fest! I have wanted to see this show forever, so we finally bit the bullet for the WAY overpriced tickets. A few minutes in, my husband whispered to me kind of a disappointment, huh? It only got worse. Everything said in all of the other low reviews, is correct. There is no storyline at all, the clown act used to waste time is terrible and while there is some definite talent, it is a shame that the show is this bad. The other couple we went with did not enjoy it either. We went to the early show and all literally nodded off during the first half hour. I will say that there are no bad seats, just a bad show. Go see The Beatles LOVE instead...its amazing!"
O,Absolutely amazing and entertaining. It is incredible to think about all the talent and creativity that went into creating and executing this show. I would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for something fun and exciting to see in Vegas!
O,"Went 14 years ago, had front row tickets, and was super impressed.

Saw it again last night and was underwhelmed. Here are some potential reasons:

1. They may have simplified some acts for safety reasons, there where significantly less awes and gasps from the audience than before
2. Living in China for 11 years, Ive seen many acrobatic performances that push the boundaries harder than O
3. They missed the catches 3 times, had a floor failure that exposed the divers, and aborted one of the acts - definitely an off night (New Years day nonetheless)

I will not go a 3rd time."
O,"I cant believe O has been on the strip for 20 years now. I went as a kid and it left such a strong impression that I felt the need to take my boyfriend to see this show....10+ years later. 

Theres technically not a bad seat in the house, but I would encourage sitting on the bottom so you can be immersed. I sat first row balcony, but I felt like the top-down view disrupted the illusion. 

I still loved it just as much though! I mean its hard to copy and find another 17 ft deep, 1.5M gallon tank elsewhere...

Note: it seems that the 7pm shows are slightly lower priced than 9pm shows - even on weekdays. 

101/365"
O,"Speechless!! I visited Vegas 2wks ago for vacation and Cirque de Soleil was on my bucket list. We decided to see 0 because it had the best reviews. Keep in mind that O is the most expensive show in the franchise because of the production costs associated with the aquatics.

We went all out and purchased front row seats (which I highly recommend if you can splurge). It was AMAZING! It has a French theme, so you its hard for most to understand, but who cares. It has so much entertainment and excitement that you forget about the theme! 

The only part that I didnt like were the mime/clown segments. I hated them and didnt find them funny or interesting but that is not enough for me to stop from giving O a 5-star review! This is a must see show!"
O,I have lost all faith in the reviewing community. How is this show so highly rated? This was a snooze fest from beginning to end. This was like paying to be on the Titantic. At least the Titantic stayed under--this show just would not quit. The comedic portions of the show were about as fun as a colonoscopy--and Id prefer the colonoscopy because at least you are asleep. The stunts were mostly synchronized swimming and diving. And please dont spend your money on a good seat. The less you see of this the better. I should have put the $200 I spent on the ticket into a slot machine because the odds are better of having a good time than watching this 90-minute O-trocity.
O,"O Yes! There is nothing better to start your day right than phenomenal customer service, especially in the morning. The weeks mornings had all started out poorly. Lots of bad energy. There was the pugnacious police academy reject TSA officer with the oversized lug nut earrings and tortured earlobes who berated me because of a small plastic comb in my pants pocket. And the ferocious shemale barista from Hell who, from her poisonous scowl, apparently got word that I hadnt tipped on my coffee to go. And on the oversold flight to Vegas from Chicago was a second act silver hen with a bad case of 80s tanning remorse who didnt appreciate me asking her to trade seats so a father and his two young children could sit together in the same row (she refused BTW). So how nice it was this morning at the O Theatre ticket office to be patiently and kindly treated by Michelle, guiding me to optimum seats at the best prices. Michelle even showed me the actual view from the seats I eventually purchased. If only everyone could be so nice. The performers in O arent the only stars in the show. I know at least one working in ticket sales. Thanks Michelle!"
O,"Ok so Ive seen a few Cirque shows like Zumanity, Ka, Beatles Love, and that horrible Criss Angel one (seriously skip this one) but hadnt gotten around to O until now. 

A few things to note:
-Arrive early! Trying to turn into the Bellagio on a Thursday night was a mess. Also youll need time park and get to theater. Running late? Just valet!! 

-There is a gift shop right outside and as you enter the theater there is art work available for sale. Its like a mini art gallery. So again arrive early so you have time to view. 

-Theres a bar with snacks and drinks available as you enter. Definitely Vegas priced.

-The show starts on time and the audience warm up act and the beginning of the show sets up the whole show so dont miss it.

- Theres no intermission!

Overall the cast put on a great show and I highly recommend you see it."
O,"It was a great show. The performers worked hard to put up that kind of show. It is hard work &amp; very dangerous since they are jumping, flipping, catching each other while they are wet. We really enjoyed this show."
O,"I was lucky enough my friend gave me 2 tickets to come see this show! I remember watching it before when I was a kid and of course I was too young to actually enjoy the show.  Our seats were great, dead center and far enough to not have neck pains and close enough to see everything clearly.  I was very shocked to see how full the theatre was for a Wednesday. 

Photographer comes around before the show to take photos for you and you can view them at the end of the show right outside in front of the giant statue.  Printed and ready for purchase. If I remember correctly the photos were $40 per album, comes with one or two photos depending which album you like.  Credit card accepted, but they only have one device, so it might take a couple of minutes of waiting. A bit too pricey, but it is On the strip and at Bellagio so the price was not a big surprise. We splurged since we got the tickets for free and I really liked the show!  The show definitely felt longer than it was, but in a good way.  A lot of cute/funny scenes and some very cool moves from the performers. I would recommend coming to see it if you want to splurge. Get the seats in the first half to the first two rows of the second half of the theatre for awesome views try to stay center, if youre on the sides just make sure you closer to the aisles down the center  although I did read somewhere that every seat was a good seat. I would do some research on that.  But there are some scenes in each part of the theatre. 
Some people in the audience were recording and taking photos during the show which I didnt like especially since it was announced towards the beginning of the show"
O,We enjoyed this very popular Las Vegas show from start to finish. Cirque du Soleil continues to deliver an incredible performance using water as their unique stage. Performing under these conditions just makes it even more thrilling. Just one recommendation is to pay the extra to get seating in the front... Its well worth the price. Enjoy!
O,"Last time my wife and I watched O was 15 plus years ago. The first Cirque du Soleil show we have ever seen. Since then we have seen a few other Cirque du Soleil shows including Ka and Mystere and not just in Vegas. We saw one show in Florida and another one in San Diego (Del Mar-San Diego Fairgrounds). 
All the shows we have enjoyed very much but O has always been our favorite. We bought the CD as well as the program the first time we saw O. You can also say that we have compared ever other show after to O; and that this particular show is the best of them all.
The colors, the performances, the characters and the music all together is just a masterpiece. The show just leaves you amazed. It is very hard to explain in detail what the show is all about. There is just so much happening all at once. It definitely takes one breath away. The most entertaining show on the strip. Worth every dollar spent. Bravo."
O,"OMG (couldnt resist sorry, thought of this in the shower), O is a must-see when youre in Vegas!

I watched my first Cirque du Soleil show, KA, a long time ago and have been entranced ever since. O was just as amazing. While it didnt have as many thrilling stunts as KA did (not saying that there werent many thrilling stunts, because there definitely were), O made up for it with its beautiful and graceful use of water, which is incredibly difficult to do well! The music for O was also spot on and makes you appreciate the performance even more. Although it didnt seem like there was a defined storyline, it was still breathtaking to just appreciate the aesthetics.

Another plus to watching O is that the theater is located in the Bellagio, which means it has a beautiful entry room, well-maintained theater hall, and incredible sound (perfect for a date night). The show is 1.5 hours and there are no intermissions, so make sure to use the bathroom before going in! I recommend arriving around 15-20 minutes before the show starts to have enough time to get seated and comfortable.

This is a family-friendly show, so I recommend any group of people to go see it! In terms of seats, I think you can get a pretty good view of the show from any seat in the house, but I would try to get closer to the middle of the theater and not too close to the stage (sit at least 5 rows back from the first row)."
O,"As is usual, from Cirque du Soleil company, this show was awesome and we were impressed of the precision of the artists ! I can come back many other times and I wont be tired !"
O,"When I was younger, I have always wanted to see O. A coveted show from what it looked like. From the promo ads, it looked like the most magical show to ever exist. From time and time again, my family I werent able to see it because it sold out, especially during the holidays. 

So it is 2019. I decided to go to Las Vegas because I had flight funds to use before its expiration date. Plus I wanted to go visit my friend, who is a Vegas local. Bought just tickets weeks before because Cirque has a promo on their tickets. I watched it on April 4, 2019, just a couple of days ago. I was so disappointed. 

First off, I looked at the seating map wrong and wasnt as close as I thought I was going to be. The view ended up not being a bad view at all. Was at the edge of the nosebleeds. The theater was beautiful. From the the architecture to the windows peaking into the staff/musicians that control the sound, I was so excited for what was in store. I came in with high expectations and I MEAN HIGH EXPECTATIONS. I already saw Le Reve and KA years ago. Absolutely lived for both of those shows. Masterpieces! 

As O went on, it got more boring than when it started. Waiting something mind blowing to happen is the worst feeling. My jaw dropped a couple of times yes, because these performers/artists were beyond talented, but it wasnt really special like I thought it was going to be. I was waiting for so many big moments to happen. I felt like they focused on more comedy than the acrobats/swimming. I almost fell asleep towards the end of the show!!!!!!! I kid you not!! Like really Cirque? Do better! I dont get why people call this the best show in Vegas. Le Reve was 2117823612873612873 times better than O PERIOD. I gotta go see it again sometime in the future. 

If yall are debating on between this show and Le Reve, save your money and go see Le Reve. You would be spending goooood money on it. I know both of these shows were created by Franco Dragone, but they are definitely different from each other. If you wanna see what this show is about, go right ahead. I dont recommend it though like I have said a million times, but that is just my opinion.....


O IS OVERHYPED!!!!!!!! IN THIS HOUSE WE STAN LE REVE!"
O,"I like more sort of broadway shows , where there is a storyline. But this show is different, there is no solid story. It is kind more of acrobatic moves and what it makes it more unique is the stage, how it gets filled with water and in few seconds gets back to solid.
The dance and the acrobatic moves are amazing. The show is 90 minutes long, with no intermission.it is kind of expensive, average $150 for a ticket"
O,"Arriving on a Thursday morning my wife and I began our search into any of the Las Vegas performances. A quick google search led me to Cirque du Soleil and the various shows they perform. My wife and I decided to stick to 1 of their performances rather then a comedy show or magician just because we felt that was more of a Vegas experience. 

Immediately after our decision we looked into pricing! I followed my instinct and searched google for cheap tix, after that I walked over to the half-priced ticket shop, then I tried my luck at the concierge, and finally I simply walked up to the box office. Believe it or not the box office gave me the best deal, I didnt use military discount, didnt even use my M rewards discount and Ray at the box office told me he would find me the best deal! He wasnt wrong, we got seating at row B section 103! To put that into perspective we sat right in the middle section of the auditorium, in the 2nd row from the front, it was outstanding! Thank you Ray from Washington. 

Ill get straight to the point about the performance, it was a breath taking. I can now strike this off my bucket list! Nothing but amazing stunts and acting that incorporated fire, water and air elements. I dont believe it matters where you seat, because Im the end the performers do a great job of going around the seats and dont necessarily use just the stage"
O,While in Vegas you must do the O. They had some technical issue this night that delayed the start of the show but it was well worth the wait. The show is just simply amazing. There is so much happening it can be hard to take it all in. The first few rows could get a little damp. There is always a chance you could become part of the show. Dont miss this when you are in Vegas 100% worth the time and money.
O,"No storyline, if there is one, I didnt get, acrobatics ok, I still think mystere was much better, disappointed really, esp after all the positive reviews, but I still try to watch the other shows"
O,"The acrobats, divers, and synchronized swimming were really cool, but those things are always really cool, and Ive seen better in circuses, county fairs, and amusement parks--And for much less money! 

The stage is amazing. At times, the stage is deep enough that they are diving from the ceiling. At other times, it is completely dry or only ankle deep. 

Unfortunately, the show itself is just weird. There is SO much going on and none of it has purpose; its just chaos. Its like a boring, bad dream. Its begging for a story line. All that talent and all those special effects are just wasted on this fanciful, meaningless, disarray. And the clowns were really dumb. I just didnt get this show at all."
O,"Fantastic show!  

I have seen 2 other Cirque shows and was excited to see O with the water element included.  I wasnt exactly sure what to expect, but when the familiar Cirque clowns started to warm up the crowd a few minutes before showtime, I knew that I was going to be in for a very entertaining treat.  The diving and water was spectacular.  The costumes and characters were very creative and also added a lot.  There was so much going on that I was always looking to the left, right, down into the water, way up high, and even up to the musicians tucked behind cover.

There are two concession stands in the lobby and they were pretty quick when we arrived.  I had a margarita which wasnt too fantastic, but it was nice to have something during the show.  They do a good job of moving the whole crowd in and out of the theater very quickly and efficiently."
O,Another grand slam performance by these talented people.Always an impressive feast for the eyes
O,"Enjoyed this completely!! Audience participation was 5 Star also.
Entertainers kept us on the edge of our seats. These artist are TALENTED and the energy fed through to the audience in all languages. The stunts had us gasping in amazement. Yes Id pay to see this again!!"
O,"had been to Vegas many times, finally my wife and I decided to go to the O show. We where so excited at the beginning but after 40 minutes into the show. both of us almost fall asleep. maybe we didnt understand the show or just got bored looking at the pool.
FYI - parking was $24 for a few hours"
O,"Wait for years, finally came here with wife for the O show and it was a
  disappointed!!!! both of us almost fall asleep. maybe we understand the story or just watching that pool of water. btw Valet parking $25 for 3 hours"
O,"This was an excellent show.  I was tring to compare it to Love down at the mirage but thats not possible as there is no similarities at all. 

I would differnly watch this again.  I loved the live orchestra and singers in the boths.  They where as entertaining as the show.

Everyone needs a chance to come and see these shows.  I understand the costs if these tickets now after finally coming to see the show."
O,I have seen shows.  This totally SUCKED!  I guess if you like Cirquish?  Ibdont speak itcant tell you how many times I just fell asleep and I suffer from MAJOR insomnia.  My husband and I paid $300.00 and the site kept saying only two tickets left so we immediately bought tickets.  At the show they were giving $50.00 off shows. Go gamble or find something else to spend $300.00
O,"This was absolutely fabulous! So visually stimulating! Vegas at its best! Oh my gawd! So many different things to look at... loved the water.  
Left stunned and feeling numb."
O,Beautiful show..with great talented performers! Must see show in Las Vegas. Love the artistic scenes! And the acrobatic talent is outstanding
O,"Last year it was my delight to see the spectacular performance of O at the Bellaggio 
First time to Vegas and this was the highlight to an enchanting evening."
O,"O is one of the most exhilarating shows in Vegas. Its a very expensive production, the artists perform death-defying acts, and the whole show is just spectacular!

Im personally more of a comedy person, and would prefer more jokes to glitzy acrobatics...but I genuinely enjoyed every bit of O. If comedy is your thing, you might enjoy Zumanity/Absinthe. But if you want to feel awestruck, then this is the show for you. I felt that O is more physically demanding the some of the other cirque productions and will gladly give my money to these performers!"
O,"SEATING RECOMMENDATION BELOW...

Definitely the top Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas! Having already seen Mystere, I wanted to make O my second Cirq show to see how it compared. Well, I wasnt disappointed. O exceeded my expectations and beyond. Its a great show, family friendly, and visually spectacular. The show leaves you wondering what you just watched, its so wam bam and in your face artistic beauty. 

The show runs 90 mins from start to finish and youll want to come about 15-20 mins early to get thru the ticketing line and to your seats. The show isnt like some of the other Cirq shows, theres little audience involvement. Although it seems like theyre picking random people, the people theyre picking are clearly planted in the audience.

My SEATING RECOMMENDATION is to not sit close to the stage. In fact, the closer you are the worse your seats will be... because if youre too close youll be straining your neck the entire show looking up and wont be able to see the entire stage. The best seats are in the 200s, upper orchestra section,  closest to center as possible. The lower orchestra towards the back isnt bad either. Stay away from too close and too far (balcony is pretty far and things will seem a little small). 

Overall, O is a spectacular show. Whether its your first O show or youve seen others, you wont be disappointed in O at the Bellagio!!!"
O,"This is an incredible show. If you want to see a show in Vegas, make it The O Show.

Its a water show. Fantastic divers, hot bodied men doing acrobatic stunts... it was very entertaining. The guy they pull on stage in the beginning is part of the show. Mid show, theres another guy who was pulled on stage is also part of the show. I wanted to spoil it for yall reading this review because I am evil.

Any ways, it was great...4 out of 5 stars because the fire scene triggered me. I had a dream once I was in a fire pit and the show reminded me of the 18 levels of hell. But still, go see it... its great."
O,Suuuuuuper nice. One of the best Ive seen. Too bad wasnt able to start it. The fire and water acts were so nice. Thinking of buying another ticket next time to catch the first 30 mins. Get the seats before the balcony. Ok at that price.
O,"Fantastic acts, good humor, amazing production quality. A must see when in Vegas! (also, you can bring in drinks from outside)"
O,"Ive wanted to check out a Cirque show for a long time, and decided to take my daughter on a road trip to Vegas to see one.  After reading some reviews I chose O...and it was a genius choice.  It was a beautiful, artistic circus of acrobatics and diving.  The stage was so impressive, a huge pool that adjusted constantly from deep to varied levels to shallow to solid surface.   My daughter and I agreed that it was simply the best show wed ever seen.  We did not want it to end.  The seating is great, didnt appear to be a bad one, and the venue is great too.  Highly recommend!!"
O,"I just dont get all the hype about the show. Yes its pretty amazing theres a huge pool as a stage and the Cirque acrobats are amazing as always, but there is no common thread between the acts, no plot and no emotion. The acts are impressive but without an emotional pull it gets kind of repetitive. I feel like after 20 years, this show needs to be updated and adjusted to the 21st century. 
Many seats were empty when we went on a weekend, and that should send the management of the show a clear message."
O,"Decided to check out Cirque du Soleils O at the Bellagio Casino and Hotelduringa recent spring trip to Las Vegas, after hearing that it was the best show in town. 

We paid about $190 for each ticket, before speaking to a customer representative on the phone for the casino we were staying at in Mirage, which is owned by MGM as is the Bellagio. We found out that since we were staying at a MGM property, we could get a cheaper rate by booking through the concierge which the representative did on the phone and got us a refund for about $30 or so. MGM also helped with parking at the Bellagio, which was included in the $12 a day parking at any MGM property throughout town. 

We had fairly good seats, although we were towards the back center, we still had a great view. One critique Ive heard is that you might not get a full view of the show if you sit too close, but again had a great view in the seats we were at. 

The show itself was unlike Ive ever seen, it was also my first Cirque du Soleil show ever. Ive never been to a show that was in water, so certainly a unique experience. I was blown away by the acrobatics, stunts, and agility of the performers, truly amazing and exceptional! However I did get bored at points throughout the show as there wasnt a storyline. I think think next time, Im going to skip a show altogether in Vegas."
O,"We have been to many cirque shows and this was our first time to this show. Like most of their show they dazzle you with colors music and an overall great show. This show was no different, it had drama, humor and pure entertainment that I recommend to all to see. That being said our favorite is still La Reve just subtle differences but I would recommend seeing them all, it is well worth the cost of a once in a lifetime experience."
O,"ABSOLUTELY incredible. This was a spectacular show and everything went above and beyond any performance I have ever seen. 
The stage itself is amazing and the designers and operators deserve an award for how its synchronized with the show. 
This is a must see if youre in Vegas. 

The only downside is that they let people in late after the show had started it. It was quite rude and frankly made the beginning a lot worse having people walking in every couple minutes."
O,"My wife wanted to see a Cirque du soleil show and she decided on O.  This show has been around for nearly twenty years, but we finally made it.  After sitting down, two clowns came through to warm up the crowd.  They were hilarious and I loved how they kept spraying people with water.  

The show was ninety minutes long with no intermission.  The show had a nice flow and there were small breaks in the acts, where the clowns came back.  I actually thought Cirque du Soleil would entail all high wire acts, but I liked this water show."
O,"Best Cirque du Soleil Ive ever seen! By a long shot. We had front row, center seats but I think any vantage would be sufficient to see the show. 

 It may even be the best show Ive ever seen. The most astonishing part of this particular show is the engineering used for the stage. I would love to know what happens behind the scenes! In one act they have performers (from very high heights) dropping into an obvious deep pool of water that encompasses the entire stage. The next they have synchronized swimmers and then, its back to a normal stage with people running across it and only a thin layer of water covering the surface. How do they do it? Magic in itself. And the talent, discipline and skill of these performers is just mind blowing. I loved this show and cannot recommend it enough."
O,"Two words, not thrilled....

The last time I was in Vegas I saw Le Rev and was impressed beyond belief.  I had heard that O was a  water or aquatic show too. I had to go. I didnt care that the seats were expensive , I had to see what everyone was talking about. 

Im not quite sure what others were talking about. The performance lacked a storyline and there was a lot of slapstick humor.  I mean really, two clowns floating on a house trying not to get wet and not sink? How is that amusing for an adult?!

The costumes and athleticism of many of the performers were outstanding.  Many of the costumes were very original and beautiful.  Some of the smaller acrobatic pieces were very artistic and well put together. But as a whole, the show O was very scattered and eclectic. 

I understand there must be clowns in a circus, but if I wanted to see stupid slapstick comedy, Id go to a real circus for one third of the price. 

Sincerely , 
        Disappointed"
O,"Omg I would watch this show again in a heartbeat! It is expensive but thank goodness for my work discount! Ive been wanting to see a Cirque du Soleil show for years and I finally planned a trip with my boyfriend to go see it. The acrobatics, dancing, and especially the synchronized swimming and diving into the pool from practically the ceiling are jaw dropping! Try to come early so you can get pictures and order drinks before you go in. We only had 15 minutes before the show started since I flew in straight from work to meet my boyfriend here and thats not enough time to stand in the long lines for the bar and get pictures. You dont have to dress up but its a really nice venue so we dressed up for it and we were having a nice dinner after. Get food beforehand we were starving by the time the show ended. And no you cant take pictures or record videos until the very end and I did see a lot of security going around telling people to put their phones away. Its not worth it to get kicked out of this amazing show."
O,"I would give 6 stars if I could.

I have had the pleasure of seeing quite a few Cirque du Soleil shows on and off the strip. While each one is awesome, O takes it to a whole other level.

Everything comes together magnificently: the music, the costumes, the stage and the performers. There is not one dull moment. There is no repetition. Everything is refreshing, exciting and impressive.

I love how they introduce different cultures and embrace the LGBTQ community. Very cool.

While their price of admission is a bit higher than other shows, it is well worth every penny."
O,"On a recent visit to LV, we saw O at the Bellagio.  Ive seen numerous Cirque productions over the years, but this fast became my favorite.  A stunning piece of theatre and music.  Tickets were expensive, about $300. for two, but we had excellent center seats midway up from the stage.  A memorable experience.

Note:  Do not miss the beautiful garden in the Bellagio with its representation of the Isle of Capri.  Precious."
O,"My husband had seen O about 15 years ago and raved about it, so we were in Vegas with the family we bought tickets for six of us $150 per ticket. About five minutes in, my husband and look at each with WTF? on our faces. He says it is not AT ALL the way the show had been. Now its all strange characters doing random, distracting things. Terrible choreography!! Absurd, stupid noises, un-funny clowns (who were trying to BE funny), the dumbest, slowest skit on earth during scene changes. We honestly almost walked out, but didnt want to be a distraction ourselves. There were a few highlights. High dives from moving platforms, contortionists, and one great balancing act. All of the above made up about 20 minutes of a 90 minute show. Honestly, we felt ripped off. The worst Cirque show we have ever seen. If you want to see a Cirque show, go and see LOVE. Have seen it twice and definitely the best one out there. In a way I hesitate to even recommend that because of the bad taste I have for Cirque Co in general at this very moment."
O,"Excellent show, as can always be expected from Cirque du Soleil. Engaging performances bring a variety of emotions and production is top notch. To think O has been on for so many years, yet still manages to impress us like this is nothing short of amazing. Its almost magical to see actors flinging themselves into the water, only to have another one walk over its surface a few seconds later. Great job fellas!
On a side note, one thing that deserves some thought: Im all for clapping during the performances and praising the actors on stage for their effort, but stopping continuity to ask for applause kinda takes a little away from the moment. We really like whats going on, some of us just prefer to wait until the wonderful journey is over before showing our appreciation to the people who made it happen.
Cheers!"
O,"I wasnt sure how to rate this show because I only saw half of it.  The box office told us the balcony was great seats and you can see everything...that was a lie.  Cirque du Soleil should be ashamed for selling these tickets.  I could not see anything on stage or happening in the audience, I couldnt see the clowns facial expressions to understand the act, and I couldnt see any of the costumes or other actors to understand the point of the act.  I spent over $200 and was super excited to see the show.  Well I ended up spending $200 to sit in uncomfortable tight seats for over an hour watching a light and water show that I couldnt see well enough to understand.  Disappointed to say the least.  If you go, sit on the lower level or save your money!"
O,"VEGAS YELP CHATS ONLY MUST SEE
When I began planning my trip to Las Vegas 5 months ago, I quite naturally started a talk thread in the Yelp room asking for theater recommendations. O was unanimously the favorite. And for me it was the best show Ive seen in years.

ACROBATIC, SURREAL, ROBUST, ENDEARING
My recommendation: order your tickets at least 6 weeks in advance. Get the best seats, front row balcony or rows E-L close to section 102. Yep, you will pay about $200 but if you buy apples, cheese and Frontera wine at the Mandarins CVS and skip the Casinos $21 Old Fashioneds (like I did) its well worth the sacrifice."
O,"As a Las Vegas local, Ive had the opportunity to see a number of Cirque shows over the last 10 years. O has long had a reputation of being the crown jewel of Vegas Cirque shows. It has a combination of water acts and typical Cirque displays of strength and physical ability along with great live music. If youre seeing Cirque for the first time this is a great show to start with. If youve seen others, this might leave a little to be desired, but there definitely parts that will get you excited. 

For what it is worth, if you are deciding between this and the very similar La Reve, my opinion is that La Reve is the better show--partly because of the design of the theater where no one has a bad seat and the experience is immersive.  

The photo is from limited view section 304 row aa seat 1. The limited view is caused by the railing which is. It in the photo. If youre tall it is not such a problem, but for shorter people it is going to be an issue. From this location you can see everything, but you are above the height of most of the action."
O,"Obviously, with Cirque du Soleil, youre going to get incredible talent, mind-blowing acrobatics, sets, music.  This show has the whole cannoli.  Very impressive.

That said, I was just a little disappointed with O.  Maybe I set my expectations too high.  I found it to be a bit flat.  At times, I was even bored.  

I know its unfair to compare it with Love as theyre just too different.  However, now that Ive seen both, Love is a far more entertaining show."
O,"We often discuss the extent of doctors, lawyers, and engineers capabilities to change the world, but seldom do we consider the impact of the performers, musicians, and artists out there. 

I watched O for the first time four years ago, and just recently came back for a second round. Never before has any art form stirred my emotions in the way O can--Cirque puts it so well when it invites its viewers to overflow their senses. 

One of the best aspects of this show is undoubtedly the soundtrack--the combination of Asian and African influence, mystical voices, and exotic instruments is among the most magical Ive ever seen. Among others, Svecounia, coupled with the cerceaux act, is just... absolutely breathtaking. :) Though the lyrics are written in multiple foreign languages, the O soundtrack always manages to get stuck in my head, and Im not complaining. 

I love the show for its touching portrayal of the otherworldly: the surreal, almost nonsensical, realm of O. Every character--Le Vieux, the Comets, and Moonhead in particular--portrays its fair share of angst, absurdity, and wonder, and I love it. To witness these incongruous (read: outlandish) characters interact and fulfill this concept of infinity is unlike anything Ive ever seen--to be completely honest, Im still trying to wrap my head around the jarring concepts and framework the characters operate within. Its awesome. 

For anyone out there wondering which Cirque show to watch in Vegas, its this one. What a treat it is to immerse oneself in another dimension in such an extraordinary way."
O,"Not the cheapest ticket in town but who goes to Vegas to save money? Live a little. Splurging on this show wont be a regretful experience as this is far and away the best Cirque show on the strip.

The actors/acrobats were nothing short of amazing. The things these people were able to train their bodies to do is awesome in the truest sense of the word. High flying, breath-taking and visually hypnotic, O is an experience you wont soon forget. Just as impressive, to me, was the stage for the show. This thing must have cost a fortune the likes of which NASA would have trouble calculating. The stage alters between pool, runway, stage, river, ocean and vortex. It switches between modes so seamlessly that I found myself marginally worried at times that somebody forget to hit a switch somewhere and one of the actors would dive into the hard stage instead of a pool. 

I was visually and aurally impressed for 90 straight minutes. When in Vegas, this is a must, if only once in your life."
O,"What a waste of time and money! The ushers seated us in the wrong seats and then when they moved us to the right seats, they scolded us and told us we are interrupting other viewers. They were definitely rude and out-of-line. Take caution if youre still thinking about booking this show. It was boring and forgettable. My wife and I were both falling asleep through almost the entire show. The only thing worth the price of admission was a 10minute stint of acrobatics. I would definitely not recommend this show. Readers be warned, this is not a kid friendly show and there is a gay love story nested in this show. Bottom line, spend your money on a different show if you must see a show. I would recommend Le Reve instead."
O,"Seriously?!? 
One of the worse performances Ive seen all my life. 
The show is soooooo boring. 
Nothing really out of ordinary. About 50 or so performers just running and jumping without any significant actions during the entire show. 

I couldnt wait till it was done. When it was, I thanked god. 

Basically waste of money and worse waste of time."
O,"Ive now seen 2 shows by Cirque Du a Soleil it would be too hard to pick which one is the best both were very memorable. The acrobatics was top notch and amazing. Each set was incredible. This show had it all too water, fire people diving from the roof. I would recommend this to anyone in Vegas worth the money!"
O,"Absolutely spectacular performance! We had front row seats. We were hesitant to buy front row seats as some reviewers stated to steer clear from the front if you dont want to get splashed. Im happy that we decided to get front row seats. I felt more engaged in the performance and enjoyed seeing the expressions on the performers faces. We didnt get drenched in water like Shamus wet zone. We only felt a light mist of water at one time and a couple drops of water from a performer. Once in the Bellagio, there is ample signage to direct you to the theatre. The theatre was beautiful. Some reviewers also mentioned an intermission. There is not a moment in the show without something going on. So I suggest to get any drinks or concessions prior to the show starting."
O,"I really hate to do this. Partly because the show is art and very nicely composed and partly because it gives such an astounding evidence of what human bodies are capable off that i hate to give it less than 5 stars but i have too :/ i have too because this show does leave something to be desired, which the viewers noticed. First of all, this show need to be cut to an hour. After an hour, myself and many others were either bored, tired or just waiting for the show to end. Since i had already seen La Reve, which is also a show performed in the water i was not in for a complete surprise. 

The performers are obviously graceful and lithe and wow the audience. If the timing was cut short, the show would be great. The addition of the clowns was the favorite part for most of the audience as it brought a refreshing angle to the otherwise monotonous story."
O,"Honestly I dont have enough words to tell you how good this show was. I would watch it over and over again if I could! The technical features were insanely fun to watch. All instruments and singing were done live which was a fun touch! The show had me gasping and laughing and in awe the entire time! If you have the chance to see this show, splurge and see it, I promise you wont be disappointed!!"
O,"Omg, a terrible terrible show. Complete waste of money!!!!!

Too much money for simple things such as jumping and running of people. 

I would totally encourage you to keep your money and not waste it"
O,"O is certainly one of the top shows to see here in Vegas, but it is also one of the most expensive ones. Thats where I cant justify paying extra for O compared to other acrobatic-based shows in town. For example, the acrobatics and the stunts were more exciting in KA and the water choreography/visual dynamics were superior in Le Reve. Maybe I just came in with too high of an expectation (since the ticket price was about 20% higher for O) but I walked out feeling Ok, that was alright. This sentiment was echoed by the others in our group as well, some of whom were their first time seeing Cirque shows.

Also, theres no need to get the lowest level seats thats around the $220+ range. With the way the stage is structured, the mid-level $150-170 seats are just fine."
O,First time watching cirque du soleil and extremely impressed with the quality of the show and skillset of the performers . The stage is just breathtaking and some of the pieces in the show are awe worthy.
O,"This is the best show ever!! It has everything and more of Cirque du Soleil. It combines the athlete-actor thing plus water with new swimming athletes. They are great and keep you watching without a glance every second. Music is so nice I bought the CD and some other souvenirs. The theater is amazing as the Bellagio Love one. I think these two are my favorites by far! The stage is like another actor! It keeps moving. There are lots of people working at the same time and you dont even notice. The actors keep their breath in the water and get assisted by divers...they think i everything!!! Then the actors appears somewhere else!! They are the best!
 Try to book your tickets a month before the wvent because you might not find room week before! The sell as crazy . You cant go without watching it!"
O,"Ive been wanting to watch this show for so many years and I was so excited to finally watch it. Its located in the Bellagio Hotel. The theater is spacious and there are people to assist you to find your seats.  You can purchase snacks and beverages.  They have popcorn, cookies, muffins, pretzel, coffee, tea, latte, espresso, ice cappuccino, ice mocha, ice latte, and fountain drinks.  

::Food::
We got a bag of chips and a bottle of water. 

::Seats::
We sat on section 102 Row D Seats 11 and 12.  It was a good seat but a little too close.  I read some review that suggested to sit in the middle so you will get a view of the entire performance.  I also read the box seats are nice.

::Experience::
Before entering the theater you are welcomed by many statues representing the show.  After we bought some snacks we walked towards the main entrance and one of the staff assisted us with finding our seats.  As we waited for the show to start, there were two clowns that entertained everyone.  They were following people and being silly.  I couldnt really follow the story but there was a lot of activities. What I enjoyed the most was the aquatic performances.  There were synchronized swimmers and acrobats.  The divers performed above and in the water.  During the intermissions two funny clowns would entertain the crowd; they were funny.  The stage totally wowd me!!

::Customer Service::
Friendly 

::Rating::
I give it 4 Stars because I found myself a little bored at some moments of the show.  I expected more action to happen.  Would I watch it again? No, but its a nice show to experience.  I loved the stage and the enjoyed the aquatics performance. 

::Tip::
Call and ask for the staff to suggest the best seats.  

::Ms Notes::
Taking pictures during the show is not allowed."
O,"One of the best Cirque shows Ive seen. Its different than most of the other Cirque shows.

We picked front center seats, second row. You would think the closer to the stage the better. Well, there were some acts that were high up so we had to look up for a long period of time. And there were some acts above and behind our heads. I suggest sitting at least 10 rows back from the stage. That way you can see everything at once and anything that is above you.

No one really got wet during our show even for us being in the splash zone. Maybe a couple drops so dont expect much from that.

We thought staying at the Bellagio would get us a better rate but that was not true. The M Life member discount is all they offer. Make sure to show your M Life cards for better prices."
O,"Im am not sure how some people said they got bored with O. Ive seen several Cirque Du Soleil shows and this one was one of my favorites, hands down. Although - I must say - some acts (like the high swinging boat) you may have seen at other shows, but they put a different twist on it which makes it ok.

To me, the most fascinating thing about O is how quick the water moves. You see people walking over it and in the next minute, acrobats diving into the same spot from 40feet high. The production is mind blowing. 

And yes, theres really not a plot. Like most of their shows. Its a fancy circus anyways. There are clowns, acrobats, music and lights. Its suppose to be amusing and not necessarily tell a story, like the Michael Jackson one, for instance. It is suppose to be entertaining and it surely is. You look around and see grey-haired people with their jaws dropped in amusement. Its a beautiful thing.

I was lucky enough to get amazing seats and I was so close to the stage I could actually get some mist of water on me. Fascinating. It was expensive $180 per ticket, but totally worth it."
O,Mixed reviews on this one. We sat in the third row from the show. It was beautiful to watch but boring at the same time. I couldnt follow it very easily. Not my favorite and definitely not worth the price.
O,"During my most recent trip to vegas, the wife wanted to see O.  I had seen this show before about 10 years ago back then I thought that it was a great show.  Even watching it again after 10 years, I must say I wasnt disappointed.  This time around we sat in the middle section and the seats we just as good and possible even better than the ones I had previously.  The show is still quite expensive I think my wife paid $150 for each seat.  Still worth it."
O,"Great show! 

Valet away from the main entrance on the Flamingo side for the shortest walk to the showroom, its free with a MGM players card

Be prepared if you sit in the front row or two to get a little wet

Be prepared to pay $$$$$ for cocktails before you go into the show (this is our third Cirque show so we already knew)

Be prepared to be wowed!"
O,"After hearing about this show for so long, I was super excited to finally go see it. 

It did not disappoint! The water and stage was incredible. There were definitely times when I had to hold my breath during the performances. The set design was superb, the comic relief in good taste, and overall just an amazing show. I dont know if it was worth what we paid for it, but I can see how much work was put into the production. I especially enjoyed seeing the live musical performances to the sides of the stage.

I was never bored! The only criticism I had was that the show often had too much going on at the same time. Synchronized swimmers on the right, actors in the middle, and dancing/aerobics on the left? Sometimes Id hear applause to find Id missed something because I was looking at another part of the stage. :(

Compared to KÀ, I liked KÀ better, but I think I have a preference for stories. However, nothing can match the water stunts in O. Also, you never knew what to expect so I was kept on the edge the whole time. I never found myself waiting for O to end. :)

Totally recommend if you are coming to Vegas!"
O,"How good were our seats? They were Elton Johns when he attended. Was the $200/seat worth it? Unequivocally YES. 

My little one hates trying anything new. And going to a big show had her nervous for days. Walking into the auditorium, she was clutching my hand like a vice. I was very appreciative of the usher who showed up with the cushion to help elevate her so she could see over the  overgrown princess. --the woman who caused a scene when she refused to hand over her phone after illegally taking pics. Really, lady?!  After the princess was dealt with, the clowns came out and by then, her nerves were an afterthought. --the show had her completely captivated. 

You cant go wrong with the usual Cirque Du Soleil acrobats, coupled with water and high dives.  A fantastic performance for people of any age. There are very few truly family friendly attractions in LV, but this one is at the top of my list. A must see if you are traveling with kids or in need of a showgirl reprieve. ;)"
O,"I saw a Cirque du Soleil show about 20 years ago and I remember I was astounded. This time I was disappointed. The performers were still flawless and I appreciated the live music, but the show itself (the story/message, props, etc.) was unimpressive to the point I couldnt wait for it to be over.  It seemed like a bunch of random characters repeatedly appearing on stage in a senseless manner or just in a way to set up the tricks the performers would do,  which seemed like exactly the same tricks I saw decades ago. It felt like a waste of my money, time, and a vacation experience that could have been something much better.  The only consolation is that my money went to support the performers (hopefully)."
O,"Ive lost track of how many times Ive seen this show. Every time I bring a friend to Vegas I take them to O. 

Its an amazing show. The live music, the acrobatic performances, comedy, the pool that appears and disappears. Everything huge in scale. 

It was also educational going on YouTube and finding videos showing how the show was rehearsed and performed. Its really amazing. Its a water show, its a circus with trapeze acts, its an amazing extravaganza. Its the type of show one can see over and over."
O,"Absolutely incredible, stunning, creative, beautiful, and downright breathtaking.  It made me exclaim in surprise, laugh with joy, clap with delight, and nearly moved me to tears at points.  O is more than just a show; its an experience that everyone should partake in at least once.  The costumes, sets, and music are spectacular.  I bought the soundtrack and the program, so I can relive the O experience at home.  Ive seen other Cirque de Soleil shows before, but Ive never been blown away until O.  If you think you can skip O because youve seen other Cirque type shows, think again.  It was head and shoulders above any other acrobatic show Ive seen.  

O is extremely expensive, but worth absolutely every penny.  I would definitely go again and invest in even better seats.  I was in the 200 section ($157 a ticket after 15% discount), which was good, but I would want to be even closer to the action next time."
O,"The most incredible show Ive ever watched!

Tickets will run you well over $100 per person but you want to make sure you pick a seat that will allow you to get a complete view of the performance. The upper most rows of the Center section are perfect! I have no words to describe how I feel about O...it is a production that gives you the chills, has you in a whole different world. 

Though not for everybody, you will thoroughly enjoy this show if you appreciate theatre. 

FYI:  The acrobatics wont be enough to wow you, you will need to appreciate the entirety of what is happening and how much man power it takes to make this amazing-ness happen. 

From what I here of other Cirque shows, O. is more of a storyline than action packed. So if youre looking for a lot of action, pick something else! Regardless, there is a lot going on story wise and you will need to keep an open mind and eyes to capture the beauty of each scene. There is symbolism in every scene. Blink and you will miss a ton. The crew is phenomenal and the diving techniques and pool they use are crazy!

The show starts before you even find your seats! Be sure to look around you. Wont give away much more...just watch it!!! Also be sure to come earlier than your show time because they are super strict on their timing and you will get locked out of the theatre even a minute late. This show was the highlight of my husband and Is trip to Vegas. Im pretty damn sure that no other show by Cirque can top this but I look forward to watching the rest."
O,"Ooh la la! Another amazing show by Cirque! Ive been dying to see this show for years and this performance blew me away! After the show, my husband asked me if it was my favorite. I simply cannot have a favorite because they are all so different. However, this is without a doubt 5 stars all the way!"
O,"For me, O payed tribute to the beauty of theatre.

O, pronounced the same way as eau, the French word for water. 

Think about this for a moment ...what if you were asked to let your imagination run wild....come up with a circus themed show utilizing hundreds of performers and technicians...then, perhaps add and Incorporate acrobats, aquatic ballet swimmers, trapeze artists, contortionists, synchronized swimmers, clowns and gymnasts all based around a constantly changing stage that moves in and around water...

The O  Experience is just that, an aquatic work of outstanding artistry, skill and beauty.  Produced by Franco Dragone and Barry Farley.  Inspired by the concept of infinity and the elegance of water, world-class artists master their trades creating a breathtaking experience. These men created this show in the 80s when technology was still a dream.  

O is a water-themed stage production by Cirque du Soleil, a Canadian based circus and entertainment company.  The cast is primarily European, very well disciplined in their craft.

The show has been in permanent residence at the Bellagio in Las Vegas since October 1998. Its a classic, one of the first few respected artistic aquatic shows to make its debut in Las Vegas. In 2011, O grossed over a billion dollars since the show opening in 1998.

To understand Os complexity further, take a backstage tour.  Your understanding and appreciation level for the show will  improve and the cost of these tickets (it isnt cheap) will be validated.

Just in case you cant make it to the tour, here are some interesting and amazing facts that you may wish to learn before you see O, which will help appreciate all the behind the scenes activity:

This stunning water show takes place in, around and above a pool of water, featuring water acts such as synchronized swimming as well as aerial and ground acts. The O theatre, which is designed to resemble a 14th-century European opera house, has 1,800 seats, thus allowing the performance to be watched by 3,600 people every evening.  
O was inspired by the infinity and elegance of waters pure form, which pays tribute to the beauty of this amazing  theater. A group of 150 stage technicians assist in the production of the show, the cast has 85 performers: international acrobats, synchronized swimmers, and divers. Some of them are former Olympic athletes.

The pool contains 1.5 million-gallons of water and is cleaned 3 times a day.  When maintenance needs to be performed, the pool is drained in about 12 hours to the Bellagio Lake, causing the lakes water level to rise 1 inch. The pool is kept at 88 F and has an underwater communication system and regulators that allow performers to breathe underwater.  Every member of the cast is scuba-certified.
The underwater stage lift was produced in order for the platform stage to rise and fall in the water without a wake, the surface of the stage has thousands of tiny holes which were drilled out by the technical team. Heaters under each seat help control the theatre temperature for the audience; the goal is to maintain two temperature zones in the theatre. The stage is kept at a higher temperature while the audience area is kept at a lower temperature. A temperature sensor every few seats in the theatre helps to ensure the audience area is maintained at the correct temperature.

The Orchestra
To minimize damage to the musical instruments, the musicians play from glass enclosures in the theater. Some of the musical instruments used in the show are more than 100 years old. The unique string instrument heard in the soundtrack of O is an erhu, a traditional Chinese bowed string instrument.
The music was daring and beautiful all at once.
It paired like a fine wine to each act.

O had its 8,000th performance on July 20, 2015.
Cirque du Soleils O at Bellagio celebrates 19 years, of technical wizardry this year.
There are 15 technicians underwater during the show, performing various tasks such as artist handling and props manipulation.
The horses that the comets ride in the show weigh 900 pounds 
The clown house weighs over 7,000 pounds
Hanging 49 feet above the stage, the carousel and téléphérique (a conveyor system) carries tons of equipment as well as performers during the show.

To maintain a fresh look on the performers, some performers have multiple sets of costumes so they may reappear dry despite having been in the water. Some of the costumes only have a lifespan of approximately 20 shows due to the bromide and chlorine in the water.
O has eleven acts in total, which are performed both in, out, and above of the water.

Take the backstage tour before you see the show, if your not a theatre person, it will help you appreciate and absorb the shows complexity.  

The show weaves a tapestry of artistry, surrealism and theatrical romance.  19 years later, it will still transport you into your wildest depths of your imagination."
O,"I absolutely LOVED this show. My boyfriend purchased the tickets for my birthday and I couldnt have asked for a better birthday present. AMAZING performance. The performers are all very very talented, and If Im not wrong, some of them are actually olympic athletes. 

The performance was absolutely stunning and it actually made me cry at some point because of how beautiful it was. The performance is in, on, and right above water.... all on STAGE right in front of you!!! 

DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS!!! A must see!! Worth EVERY PENNY."
O,"This is a show of absolutely impressive visual art, acrobatics, excitement and confusion. Dont bother trying to make sense of a story, each act appears to be its own and loosely related to each other through a common theme. While visually appealing and beautiful, they keep a wholehearted balance of circus feel to it - slightly crazy, busy, goofy and odd as hell. Enter this show with an open mind and you wont be disappointed. Truly a professional level show."
O,"O was absolutely amazing.  Everywhere you look there was something happening, so you just dont know where to look!  So dont even think about bringing binoculars.

I wonder if sitting up on the balcony enables one to have a better view of the water antics.

PS - When you hear the sound of water, look about!  The pre-show is on, and who knows!  You just might even become a part of it!"
O,"Absolute fun, see the video Ive posted for the opening of the show. This was a really wonderful show. We all had an amazing time. So much going on just focus on the main scene if you start looking at all the background activities youll miss the main acts. What I found really interesting was that all the music is live. You can see the musicians playing to cue with all the acrobats."
O,"been to vegas 1000s of times in the last few years. love it. but this was the first time we saw O at the Bellagio. OMG. If tickets werent so damm expensive we wold do it more. unfortunately no discounts. well be back. music, theme and dancers were perfect. hell of a show!"
O,"Im a Cirque du Soleil fan. They make everything seem so easy. The core strength of the performers is just remarkable and awe-inspiring. 

The first time I watched O was 10 years ago with my little cousin - we were sitting in front and center. Its a wholesome show and safe to watch with kids. I still have the music CD to this show. I got to watch it again on date night. VIP tickets include seats to the VIP suite, bottle service, chocolate bon bons and chocolate covered strawberries - which made the experience more exquisite. Nothing has really changed since the first time Ive seen O

This show involves clowns that wont scare/annoy you, zebras, live music, whips, boats, unicycles, carousel horses, synchronized swimming, trapeze, ladders, fire and dream-like elements. There were a few hiccups during the performance which the boyfriend found amusing since you dont see that all the time.

One of these days when my core is as solid as a rock and bones removed from my body, Ill join CdS. They make yoga look like childs play."
O,Another great Cirque du Soleil show. The act was a little slower than others we have seen. It is more of a ballet format in my opinion. We have been to some that are over the top and this was not one of them. Still an amazing show and worth going to see and worth the money.
O,"O is a very good show, visually stunning and artistically fascinating. However, I find that I personally like KA more than O due to the lack of contiguous storyline thruout O. KA has a much more,compelling storyline and is slightly darker overall which I enjoy more. Nevertheless, O is definitely worth watching and you will certainly enjoy it."
O,"I hate to say this but this show is OVERHYPED and OVERPRICED. 

If its your very first Cirque show in Vegas and then you will love it, but if youve seen other shows like KA, LaReve and Mystere then you might agree with me (or not lol). 

We had very high expectations for the show considering the hype and expensive ticket price ($150-$300) We signed up for MLIFE and received 20% off which made it a bit affordable for us. We paid $150 per ticket and had great seats where you can see everything.

 Its a water show with mostly acrobats, synchronized swimming and some ground acts. It was phenomenal, but weve seen similar acts in other Cirque shows that are better and more unique. The clowns were hilarious but took a lot of the show time. The fire show with the dude burning the entire time was awesome and the contortionist doing all kinds of movements towards the end was incredible. But we felt like there was something missing...

Bottome line, we enjoyed KA, LaReve and Mystere much much more and tickets are way cheaper. I recommend those shows better than O. 

TIP: 
-The show is very long about 1 1/2 hr long so use the restroom before.
-They have snacks at the lobby. Dont get the croissant ham and cheese. Its super greasy! Their hot drinks are way too hot. Be careful. 
-Theres 3 entrance to the show. People were bunched up on the right side to get in, while the middle and left side was empty lol. Pay attention and do not go with the crowd ^_^."
O,"O by Cirque Du Soleil at the Bellagio was well done in many aspects. As usual for CDS, the performers are strong, graceful and daring.  What caught my attention was the fact that the stage in one act would be a deep pool, then regular ground level in the next act. This was done seamlessly. 

The divers were fantastic. The music blended well with the performances. I could have done without the clown acts, but understand that the performers must have been prepping for the next act.

The Bellagio theater was very large and nice. Our view had a slight obstruction, despite being in a prime location.  The show pulled people from the audience that were really part of CDS and this had the audience laughing and gasping. Well, at least the people next to me.  

If youve seen a few other Cirque du Soleil shows, this one is like the others, with some diving added to it. Id recommend it if you havent seen their other shows."
O,"I saw Cirque du Soleils O tonight.

The theatre is beautiful!

I had seen Kurios a couple weeks ago in Toronto and was looking forward to seeing this one ... and I wasnt disappointed.  It is similar with lots of acrobatics, balancing, singing, clapping, laughs and more ... but on and in water!  It was amazing how they made the water appear (becoming a deep pool) and then disappear (becoming a stage).  And it was fun the way swimmers would suddenly appear in the water and then disappear again (without climbing out of the pool)."
O,"I was a little disappointed by the show as it had been so hyped up and I unfortunately had such high expectations.

I think they get the crowd engaged really well before the show starts, and although there are really cool parts of the show, amazing acrobats, and great music and singing, the show was a bit too weird for me.

I also didnt like how for the price you pay, the seats are so packed together, as the guy behind me kept kneeing the back of my chair throughout the experience.

Overall, I much rather watch the free Bellagio water show outside."
O,Good show by Cirque du Soleil at Bellagio Las Vegas. So nice and if you have seat at the first floor that really good Coz you gonna see everything and everywhere
O,"One of the best performances and the stage was amazing, Ill definitely see it again in Las Vegas"
O,"Again, another show we got tickets to because of our collaboration with Cirque.

I cant even begin to describe the depth of this show. It really is just mind blowing. The stage alone is quite incredible. From transforming the solid stage into a huge pool and vice versa, just wow. The synchronized swimmers are phenomenal and so powerful. There are a lot of WOW moments from huge drops into the water, to amazing acrobatic stunts.

The clowns are quite hilarious and entertaining. I cant say enough about this show without giving it all away. Just goooo and enjoy!"
O,"Mind blown! There is so much going on all the time that I didnt event get time to take my phone out to take a picture.

The performers are very talented and the way the show is set up is amazing... definitely a must watch"
O,"By far my favorite Cirque Show! 

Its changed over the years but always impresses me. 

They now perform over water, I dont remember this being the case years ago, but its smart. Much safer for the performers.

Every time I watch O, Im disappointed in my parents for not putting me in gymnastics when I was younger! I watch in aw and envy. 

The performers are amazing! Its a magical show. Enjoy!"
O,"This is the Cirque show I recommend when people are coming to visit Vegas and they are not huge Beatles fans (the Beatles fans I send to Beatles Love which is the best Cirque show of all of them IF you love the Beatles.) With a thousand reviews, I wont talk about the show, but I will say why you should choose this one over others. First of all, its cheaper. The venue is not the largest so its a bit more intimate than the larger shows. (I had obstructed view seats to the left of the stage but it was only obscured for like three minutes at the very start of the show so Id sit there again.)

Not only is the show itself amazing, its in the Bellagio which has the most non-gambling things to do of all the casinos. Bellagio has an art gallery (yes, really) that changes periodically. Ive seen several shows there and all were good. And Bellagio has the spectacular flower exhibit that does not take long to walk through but is a must-see in Vegas, anyway. Theres also a fantastic coffee shop in there next to the flower exhibit. And the water show that you see in every movie about Vegas! 

Bellagio also has my favorite Strip restaurant which is Lago. It puts you eye level with the water show so ask for a window seat. Its a bit loud in the restaurant during peak times but if the weather is not too hot you can ask for outdoor seating and it is much quieter outside. Its the best outdoor seating on the Strip, and theres not a lot of outdoor seating on the Strip! Book in advance if you want window seats or outdoor seating. (Another good thing about Lago is it has a bathroom IN the restaurant so you dont have to walk out of the restaurant and into the casino. Which might not sound important, but it sort of is. Also, it is a really nice and private bathroom! Though, they do use sage scented hand soap which is the bane of my existence....)

Should you also stay at Bellagio? It is a great hotel, but it is not where I usually send people. I usually recommend Aria which is easy walking distance to Bellagio (easy walking distance is also rare on the strip but not in City Center which is where Aria is located and which connects to Bellagio) or I recommend the Cosmopolitan which is right next door to Bellagio. Aria has the easier parking/valet service if that matters to you. Best shopping is there in City Center and all three of these hotels are on the best part of the Strip. There is also Vdara in City Center if you dont need a casino in your hotel and want to save some money. Those three are newer hotels, less smoky, and a bit more upscale than the other hotel rooms including Bellagio. But if you want a more traditional Vegas hotel and you dont intend to leave the hotel you are staying in then, yes, Bellagio is my recommendation."
O,My favorite Cirque show so far and I have seen a few. Nothing compares to this visual effects of the gorgeous water stage and the music is amazing. Dont miss the opportunity to see this show while in Vegas and definitely splurge for the better seats. Its so worth it.
O,Spectacular Cirque Show!  Water themed and inspired combined with the elegance of the acrobatics is just a beautiful visionary dream.  The skilled performers are flawless. Cirque shows arent cheap. This is worth the splurge.  I left in utter amazement and lots of respect to the artists and their focus to deliver such an extraordinary performance.
O,"Absolutely amazing. 
Must see show in Las Vegas.
They will take you to somewhere amazing world that youll never been.....
Just sit back, relax and enjoy.
(Inside of theatre was freezing cold. I recommend you to bring a jacket or long sleeve shirt...)"
O,"I watched O last May on a Sunday (10pm showing). I think I was too tired from traveling to Vegas that day to truly enjoy the show, literally started falling asleep during some parts prior to midnight. The music was soothing at times. Nice, comfy theater and the plop of rain drops still makes me smile up to this day. Just thought it was very expensive, but it was all worth it after my dad enjoyed his first Cirque du Soleil show and mom loved her late Mothers Day gift. I chose the seats online, section 203 row X (last row in section) seats 18-21 smack dab in the middle costing me quite a bit. You could see everything! Thank goodness for income tax refunds ... Behind us were some box seats. Full house the day before Memorial Day. 

My favorite parts were the ones with the performers on the floating house. Comic relief. I dont want to leave any spoilers. 

After a colorful show like Mystère at TI, moonlit O was indeed mesmerizing but I kind of expected more. 

Pre-show entertainment calls for a few wet encounters."
O,"The first time I went to this show around the year 2000 was great, but I was too close.  The next time I went was a year later.  I sat a greater distance away and i felt the show was wonderful.  

Now, 16 years later, I went for the third time. I purposefully chose the middle.  This was way too far away. Has the theatre expanded ...? Or is it just that You need to be in the first section no matter what. 

I remember the show being much more impressive years ago. I feel like the show is now riding a lot on its name.  I wasnt impressed this time."
O,"What a great show! Their was much to watch from the synchronized swimming, cast members in the audience, raining from the ceiling, surprised fire and more. Get closer seats its worth it."
O,"I hate to admit this... but honestly, I fell asleep during the show. I guess being up super early that day and then attending the 9:30 show didnt help, but we didnt think that the show was all that its hyped up to be... especially for the price! 

Dont get me wrong -- a lot of the show was really cool, but I guess it just wasnt the high-flying/acrobatic style of Cirque that I prefer like Mystere. 

The Bellagio hotel is beautiful and the staff at the show treat you like royalty, but Im glad wifey and I finally crossed this one off our list."
O,"We chose this over all others based on a friends personal opinion and so glad we did! I can say for definite there isnt a bad seat in the house and only avoid the front few rows if you dont want to get wet. 

If we could give it more than five stars we would... Amazing"
O,"O was really cute... my second time watching it and I can say this time, Im more then satisfied. 

It has amazing stunts, cute little bits of comedy, and a few surprises for the audience. 

This is one to watch but as a person who has seen it twice, once was enough."
O,Hands down my favorite cirque du Soleil show Ive ever been to. Theres a lot that happens at once so would definitely go again.
O,This is a very creative and well thought out show. The cast was amazingly talented and kept me hooked on the performance the whole time. Also kuddos to the beautiful live music players.
O,"Got to see this show recently and it was awesome! While my favorite is still Zarkana,   this show takes place mostly in the water and that in itself is unique! 

We were lucky to get 2nd row seating , aka the splash zone, but it actually wasnt bad at all. Seems like the clowns are in every single cirque show and they were actually funny in some parts. A lot of diving from extremely high points...(dont know how they can do that @@) dancing underwater in sync with each other. 

Overall, I can only say that these performers are super talented and its a must see show in the cirque du soleil series. Ill be taking my parents when they come to visit!"
O,"Ive been to three Cirque shows (the others being Kà and Zumanity). If I had to choose between O and Kà I would give a very slight edge to O. Theyre different presentations of Cirque shows, with Kà more story-oriented and straightforward and O being more abstract and dreamlike. I just prefer O because of the acrobatics revolving around a water theme... and that the show is just simply more beautiful.

The No1DP purchased two tickets in section 103, row F, seats 18 and 19. Two Golden Circle aisle seats will cost a pretty penny... $198/person with base and entertainment tax. The view was quite stunning and I got to see the faces of the people closest to the stage. For purchasing tickets the No1DP purchased them directly from the website. We actually had a hassle-free experience picking up our tickets. Line was not long at all. Moral lesson? Purchase your tickets directly from the website. Buying from third party just creates undue hassle.

O performs twice a day Wednesday-Sunday at 7:30pm and 10:00pm. We ended up doing dinner afterwards as we learned our lesson being late twice to two other Cirque shows to do dinner *after* the show ends. We ended up being on time.

At the entrance is a permanent exhibition of artwork by Richard MacDonald that depicts dancers and acrobats at work. We didnt check it out all that much but from the few sculptures I passed by it looked like there was plenty of detail and effort to bring the sculptures to life.

We *finally* got to see a Cirque preshow - two (literal) clowns dressed in sailor uniforms entertaining the audience. The audience interaction is more limited than Kà or Zumanity. They also act as a sort of intermission. One particular scene with the audience was one of the most entertaining parts about the show.

Without spoiling the plot of O is the amazing dream of the primary male character and the primary female character represents the quest of the dream. I certainly liked the water setting but what impressed me more was the acrobatics (especially the Russian swing) and several people doing the fire display. The curtain call was pretty spectacular and gives you the only photo-op of the show. No1DP also liked that at some point the safety divers come up and are silently acknowledged by the play as being part of the production. As with Kà, all parts of the theater are used. If you look on both sides youll see a quartet on the left and two singers on the right.

Gift shop contains merchandise of O as well as more limited quantities of the other Cirque shows.

This brings up my number of Cirque shows Ive seen to three. Along with Kà I would recommend O for a good Cirque show to take a first-timer. No1DP and I differ what to see next - ONE versus LOVE. Just remember two things: purchase your tickets directly from the website and arrive on time to prevent delays in seating."
O,"We enjoyed this show but would not pay that super high price tag to see it again. 

Your typical Cirque acrobatics and the stage itself was impressive with what it could do... i.e.- one minute someone is ankle deep in water and then seconds later someone is diving from 20ft up into that exact same spot. 

We sat in Section 102, Row N, Seats 20 &amp; 21. Theses were excellent seats. Great views and one of the best things is that you are right by the entrance so when the show is over we were the first ones to walk out. 

We paid $172 per seat and after all the fees it was probably closer to $215 or so per seat which to me is insane. Great show but to me not worth that kind of money."
O,"AMAZING performers, outstanding choreography, and crazy athleticism! I was lucky to score VIP booth seats at center stage, for the cost of regular mid-range tickets, which was a great view of the show.

My fave were the divers and acrobats, but to each their own!"
O,"What an outstanding performance!!!
Gymnastics, acrobatics, divers,music and props and stages!
There isnt a bad seat in the house!"
O,"I saw O for the fourth time this past Thursday and it was excellent as always!  I first saw the show in 2004 and I have gone back every three years--not planned--but it just worked out that way.  I had a front row seat in the center section and it gave me a different view of the show than Ive had before.  

I remain amazed by the theatre and it never fails to make me say, Eau.  The acrobatics performed by sometimes wet performers, the swimming accents, the motorized sea horses (my words) all add up to a big wow factor!

The clowns are quite funny and I enjoy the interludes they provide.  The man on fire has always amazed me, too!  The thing that I like so much is that there are a lot of small things that make up the entire show--the way the red jacketed men run, the costumes, the man in black, and the divers.  It all comes together in this marvelous show that is so very entertaining. 

I am a fan of Cirque du Soleil shows--well except for one.  This still is my favorite.  It would be very hard to top this!"
O,"AMAZING! 
We came to see this show on 6/28 9:30 pm.
The show was awesome, seriously if you are in town I highly recommend !
my first cirque du soleil and not my last. 
ill admit I wasnt sure if it was worth the price ($145/ticket)
Theres water, fire, swimmers, divers, acrobats, and they are even playing the music live!
idk how they do what they do but everyone in the show is so skilled!!! 
(wont spoil it for anyone)



ok so tip : get there at least half an hour early.. there might be a line but if you already have your ticket YOU DONT NEED TO LINE UP. Just go straight for the theatre (obviously dont push and be rude though)

also: DONT BE AN A-HOLE
we had GREAT SEATS 7 rows up from the stage and I was so annoyed with the people behind or around us trying to get a picture with FLASH ON... seriously dont be that guy.. youre annoying and youre ruining it for other people.. besides youre TECHNICALLY not allowed to bring phones in.."
O,"A lot of people have said that this is their favorite Cirque du Soleil show. This was only my third but Id have to agree and am now uninterested in seeing any others (bad business model!). Being a swimmer I really appreciated the skill of the diving in the show. It was amazing to watch people, homo sapiens, be so graceful in the air and water as well as land. It felt like I watching another species (aquaman?) onstage. 

I sat up on the balcony so could see a lot of the behind-the-scenes stuff like the scuba divers swimming like shark underneath to take the performers offstage. I still havent figured out how they disappeared. Is there an underwater entrance or just a tunnel we cant see where they take them backstage? The use of the vertically moving stage was dramatic and visually moving as well. I cant imagine the work that went into designing and maintaining such a wet set!

As usual with CdS they had the street performers and clowns. I didnt really understand the plot or point of these aspects. It was really distracting from the main show."
O,"More 3.5 stars but I rounded Down. 
I enjoyed the show, but it simply fell to meet my expectations.  


I have a goal to see ever Cirque Du Soleil show eventually.. And O had been on my highly anticipated list of shows to see. Maybe thats why Im giving it only 3 stars. O has been renowned as THE best Cirque Du Soleil, and thus I had been looking forward to seeing it for years.... 
Unfortunately it failed to meet my expectations. 

The music is beautiful. The performances and choreography are on point. However, the show wasnt able to fully keep my attention. The first 20-30 minutes were enjoyable, where the final 30 minutes I was barely able to stay awake. My date dozed off for a bit. The story wasnt able to grasp our undivided attention. 

I would recommend KA and Zumanity, but cannot really recommend O, especially with its more premium price tag.  

At first, I was really bummed I couldnt get center Orchestra, but being able to get center upper orchestra in my opinion is better. Youre about to see everything better. Plus, since the show didnt mean my expectations, Im glad i didnt spend the extra premium for the lower area. 

Ive seen discounted seats on the middle towards the side, with an obstructed view. 
As we were waking to or seats, I dont think those bars would be a huge distraction. 

For those on a budget, I would recommend them. I didnt sit in them so you may want to refer to a reviewer who has, but from the walk by, it seemed worth it considering theyre heavily discounted. 


I cant really recommend the seats on the far sides for any show. You really want to be as center as possible to be and to see the symmetry and get the full experience (this is for any performance). 


The photographers at this event charged an arm and a leg, but one cant turn down some tuning and romantic photos. 
Im upset they never emailed me the digital copies they promised me though. 

Overall, I do recommend seeing O, but keep your expectations slightly lower. 

I still enjoyed the show, it simply didnt meet my extremely high expectation."
O,"Top shelf production. 

Amazing visuals and performances! 

This is a must see show.

Nuff said... Just go see it for yourself."
O,"As a huge Cirque fan, O didnt disappoint, but it wasnt my favorite show. The water and high dives were definitely fantastic points of visual interest, but towards the end, there just wasnt enough to keep my attention. 

Music was alright. The acrobatics were outstanding per usual. Once in a lifetime watch for me!"
O,"Great show. We were 7 rows from the stage. Amazing seats. Worth seeing !! 
Everyone was so amazing and on point. This was my first circus o show, but wont be my last !!"
O,"The only other cirque du soleil show Ive seen prior to this one was iris
In Hollywood, too bad they closed for good. My wife and I really enjoyed O
I think its way better than iris although both are great. 
The production and live music and stunts are just amazing.
A must watch if youre in Vegas"
O,If you like Cirque du Soleil it is a must. It is so cool that it all takes place on or in water. The sets are incredible and has a story. Recommended!
O,After seeing O in 2007 my husband was excited to see O this evening. Our group of 10 people eagerly bought their tickets based on my husbands enthusiastic encouragement.  Five minutes into the show my husband and I were compelled to suggest that we would reimburse our friends for their tickets. The show dragged as if the performers were extremely tired.The acts were mediocre at best and there was not a story line that I could tell. One of our friends said she was glad that it ended when it did otherwise she was about to nod off. Save your money this is not the O that we had come to love.
O,"Why is this show called O when there are so many possibilities? The only thing I could come up with was the fact that your mouth is in the shape of an O for majority of the time these acts are flipping, contorting, and diving through the air. Gape stupidly, I assure you everyone else around is doing the same.

In terms of plot there isnt as much as other shows by the circus of the sun, but boy oh boy there are so many other things going on. I probably spent most of the time figuring out how the divers came bursting out of the water without warning like sea nymphs.  

O is water-themed, with a pirate ship and flame wielder or two to keep things spicy, as well as a couple clowns for comedic effect. The live music is crafted to fit the atmosphere to a T. The complexity of the acts is always astounding. Costume design and stage setup is absolutely fantastic! 
 
I came out of O very pleased. Wished for a bit more plot but honestly I cannot give Cirque du Soleil anything but just for the sheer athleticism and technique of the performers and creativity behind each and every show.

Bravo!"
O,"An amazing show, though the theater is pretty big, so get seats close if you can. 

The show involved a pool which made it more interesting than the normal cirque shows. It alternated between acrobatic acts and humorous acts, I assume for stage transitions or to give acrobats time to change. Interestingly, they also had 1 or 2 live vocalists for most of the show. You could see them through the glass on the side.

One of the most dramatic parts of the show was the way they opened the curtain. When they put it back up dramatically was very bittersweet- because it was awesome but also meant the end of the show.

Dont miss checking out Richard Macdonalds sculptures on the way out. Its absolutely mesmerizing."
O,"I saw this show in February 2018 for a postponed Valentines Day celebration. I had seen Cirque Zumanity and Ka prior to seeing this show. Ka is just an amazing show overall and Zumanity was very entertaining and engaging. I had also seen Le Reve which is very similar to O in that there isnt really a story and it is a water based show. Out of those, Ka was my favorite. In my opinion, Le Reve is better than O also.

I am inclined to agree with some of the other reviews for this show in that this show was not as interesting as other Cirque shows. The acrobatics were great for the show and the stage was amazing. The music was done live and was great as well. What was lacking that puts Ka way in front of O is the lack of story. O has zero story and thus you do not get engaged. At times I was actually bored. 

The show was also much pricier than the other cirque shows. I sat in the 200s (231 and 232 respectively) and we had an awesome view of everything. I do not believe you would have had a very good view if you were sitting up front because of some of the aerial stunts, whereas sitting in front for La Reve is the only way to go.

Overall, I would say this show is entertaining and go see it to say youve seen it but if you are looking for a better overall show I would go to Ka over this. I would pay full price to see Ka again but would not pay to see O again."
O,"Absolutely breathtaking show! I first saw O almost seven years ago, on Christmas Eve in 2008 and Im still blown away by their beautiful performance!

We splurged on $150 Lodge seats in Section 104, Row E, Seats 13-14 and the view was phenomenal, so worth it! Close enough to see costume details, makeup and the artists expressions but slightly removed to see the total environment happening around the stage. The Lodge is extremely raked (i.e. at a very steep angle), so from my perspective the first two rows will force you to look up for a lot of the acts in the show - therefore if you can find a seat somewhere in the middle, or at least from Row E and back the view will be spectacular.

That being said, what makes O go above the rest is the attention and focus on the entire picture, not just the central act. Characters will appear and disappear from the water, run across the stage, fly in and out and create a picturesque backdrop that completes every scene to the most minute detail possible. The 1.5-million gallon pool is gorgeous, as well as a fantastic engineering feat controlled with such ease to come and go. You can even get a glimpse of some of the dark shadows of the divers who help the performers at the bottom!

The clowns are adorable and funny, though clowns arent usually my favorite. The best act has always been diving from the Russian Swings, super graceful and inspiring to watch. Theres a ton of talent in O and theres truly never a dull moment throughout the performance. Whether its quirky characters, gorgeous scenery or rain falling from the ceiling, youll always get wet with envy at how impressive Cirque du Soleil truly is!

Ive seen 14 different Cirque du Soleil shows, both in Vegas and around the world, all with their own special characteristics that make them wonderful, but O will always remain in my Top 5 list of performances. I could come back again and again!"
O,good show from what i seen i was a little late so i didnt get the story line at all but to me it was over priced specially from where i was sitting
O,"Great show. Was amazed how well they danced while being in the water. Use of water and regular stage was good.  Hard to follow the different stories, but just to watch the show was amazing. Just amazing to see people that can perform and move like the way that they did."
O,"Our family went to see the show recently.  We were very excited as we like acrobatics, swimming and theatre.  Unfortunately my 10 year old daughter got unnerved by the dramatic presentation and burst into tears as the curtain went up.  She wanted to leave and since she was audibly sobbing I quickly took her to the lobby.  Immediately, an alert usher approached us and nicely asked what was wrong.  I explained the problem and she offered to re-seat us in the back of the house so that the experience would be less intense for my child.  Unfortunately, my kid was too tilted at that point to enjoy the show so we declined.  As we left, a very understanding manager approached us and offered me a refund for our tickets.  She quickly gave me a refund and even gave us a beautiful souvenir.  Best show I never saw thanks to the house staff:)"
O,"Awesome show, a must see, really enjoyed it, we sat in section 204 and the seats were great , no need to pay more for closer seats trust me.
I have seen other Cirque du Soleil shows and by far the O is the best out of all of them.
Please note no kids under five are allowed."
O,Great show!! This was my first time seeing a show in Las Vegas but everyone kept telling me this was the best and now my expectations might be set too high for all other vegas shows. O is such an amazing show! A must see!!
O,"Youll Appreciate the show if your really close to the Stage .. Front seat is phenomenal.. Row A Seat 1-2 Section 103

Its just like watching Live TV show right before my eyes.. You can see their face Reaction to their Moves.. .. Bravo..

An added perks was Being an MLife member. You get an Special discount for just being a MLife member and staying at their groups of hotel.. Vdarra Corner Suite Fountain View 

Left the show with an Awesomely experience..."
O,so yes i saw lots of kids here. i think that this show isnt for everyone. there was like 4 guys behind me sleeping. its very opera-ish. im not a cirque expert but i liked la reve better. the ushers were super strict there. they will catch you on ur phone or doing something. get tickets early as they do sell out even if u try to get tickets the day of. my advice: go see it there are really amazing parts. it lasts about 1 1/2 hours.
O,"Best Cirque show by far.  They hit it out of the park with this one in terms of the whole package (stunts, sets, costumes, story, music and humor)

The most amazing part when you look back in your mind is the stage itself how it goes from a deep pool to bone dry before your eyes.

If youre in Vegas and are in the area of Bellagio, check this one out."
O,"I have no clue what the story line is aside from the fact that the guy is trying to return the girls scarf, but it seemed very disjointed to me.  The acts themselves are feats of anatomical mastery, as is to be expected for Cirque.  Im not sure Id go to this particular show again, however, just because it seemed to lack continuity."
O,"Id rather see O again instead of another Cirque de Soleil show.

* * * * * * * * 

What row are we in?
O.
Are all the rows O?
No. Supposed to be good seats though. ***

Oh.

* * * * * * * *

That was AMAZING! What was your favorite part?
ALL OF IT.

* * * * * * * *

*** Row O provided a nice view of the stage but was marred by a front row view of the many latecomers who wandered in."
O,"Situated just inside of the luxurious and elegant Bellagio of Las Vegas, O is not just another one of Cirque du Soleils resident shows that located on the world famous Las Vegas Boulevard; O is the ultimate performance that embodies the highest level of artistry in stage, costume, as well as acrobatic acts that is a sheer triumph. 

Corresponding to the theme of Bellagio, its resident show O is a tribute to the infinity and elegance of waters pure form. Unlike its whimsical (ok... and naughty) cousin Zumanity, O carries on a more serious and classy tone (I suppose maybe thats why theres a woman snoring behind us throughout the show...!!)  

The story of O is about a Sicilian boy Philemon, and us as the audience following his journey of seeking Aurora, a beautiful and mysterious girl who represent the quest itself. Throughout the show, there are acts of clowns, synchronized swimming, fire, high dive, just to name a few. Personally, I have seen this show twice, and similar to the time when I was visiting Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC, I wept as I was immersed in its fine imagery and score. 

Mind you, this class of entertainment is not cheap, the ticket alone can very well exceed one nights stay on the strip (depending on when and where youre staying.) But trust me, it is well worth the price for those who appreciates theatrical/performance arts; which is why I came back with my BF for a second show."
O,"Any CDS show is bound to excite me, however, this one left something to be desired. i have seen only 3 cirque shows, but so far this was my least favorite (LOVE and Zarkana).  It was Entertaining of course, but i think the layout of the stage does not do the performance justice.   i did go into this at a friends recommendation, it was her favorite CDS show ever and so maybe i had some high expectations going in, and it just couldnt live up to the hype? 

either way, the performance was decent, i would have like more circus feats, i didnt enjoy the water acts as much as i would have liked to, and i did not connect with the story (or maybe i just didnt understand it).  

For me this is a pass, there are better shows to see in LV."
O,"Birthday week in Vegas for my wife. This was the top rated show on yelp in Vegas. It didnt disappoint. 

It cannot be expressed in words the experience you have watching this show, but Ill try. 

The sights, lights, music and synchronization was unbelievable. Everything from the dancers to the seats were perfect. 

All I can really say, is no one who goes to this show can be disappointed, unless you have no soul. 

If you are in Vegas, you HAVE to see this show. Trust me, you wont be disappointed. Do yourself and your loved ones a huge favor. If you dont care about your loved ones take them to see Chris Angel."
O,"Outstanding show, opulent theater, outrageously talented performers: thats O!
Ive been wanting to see this show since my first visit to Vegas and the wait was well worth it. Show itself was amazing, the characters and scenes made me think of a Dali panting brought to life. 

As at other Cirque shows, there is little to no story line- this show seems to be more of a dreamlike world and I enjoyed the mostly instrumental music. 
The introductory scene is always a cant-miss moment: from the oddball characters interacting with the audience prior to start, to the way the opaque red curtains are removed to show the unique stage. The various stage transitions were by far the most unique aspect of this show specifically- I now have much more respect for my former college roommate, who was a synchronized swimmer.

Favorite performances were the girl balanced on her head (youll know her when you see her), the endless ladder going up to the ceiling, and the black-and-white-striped dancers with the metal rack- think Jabbawockeez on steroids, in midair, over water.

If you ever have the opportunity to see this show with VIP tickets, it is quite a luxe experience with a great view that allows you to see the entire stage without the constant neck-swiveling to make sure you dont miss anything."
O,"Out of all of the shows I have seen in Vegas this one blew me away! I have never been so tranquilly lost in a production as I was in this one.  From the moment the show started until the end I was amazed by the beauty of this show.

We sat in the fifth row (out of the splash zone) and I cannot think of a better investment.  I literally felt like I could reach out and touch the stage.

When the slight breeze hit us when the curtain rolled back, I felt like I was being transported into a magical world....and we were!  The grace, bravery, and skill of the artists is just amazing.  I still cannot believe some of the awe inspiring acts that were performed.

The music blew hubby and I away.  I honestly did not know it was all live until I saw the musicians on the sides.  I feel so blessed to have been able to see this show.  We definitely be going back with our son so he can see this incredible show.  Love all the cirque shows BUT this one stands out among them!"
O,"This is the most spectacular Cirque du soleil show I have seen and the price we paid for the best seats are worth it. In some scenes, there are so many things going on at the same time that you have no idea what to look at - you need like 5 pairs of eyes to see everything happening. There are numerous acrobatic and intense diving routines, with little side skits for humor. O is a not a traveling show due to the stage, so you can only see it in Vegas. Go see it! Worth it!"
O,"As frequent visitors of Vegas my husband and I have seen almost all the shows in Vegas and many other Cirque du Soleil shows as well.  Given the price for tickets for  O  this was one of the latter shows we have seen.  I purchased the middle range tickets $140 and we were seated in section 303 in the front row.  We had to sit forward and look down from the balcony, which made viewing a bit difficult. The water theme of this performance was probably the only thing that made this show interesting.  In fact I had to fight to keep my eyes open.  In my opinion this was quite boring and Im happy that I did not spend more $$$ on tickets as I couldnt wait for it to be over!!   If you want to see a good Cirque du Soleil show go and see Ka or Love by the Beatles or Zumanity for an adult version of Cirque.  You will leave feeling like it was $$$ well spent."
O,"Visually tantalizing!  Simply stunning theatrical production!! 

Opening and closing with unbelievably big red drapes that has got to be the most wrinkle resistant fabric ever~ 

One of the most memorable show in the many that we have had the pleasure to attend.

Why 4 star? Well, it is on the high side on the ticket price. They were pretty good seats but when you talk value for your money... Well, as I said before, it was a spectacular production.

Bravo, O!"
O,"I am not a show type of guy but really enjoyed seeing this! The best part is that the show is 1 hour and 40 mins straight through, no intermission. So it is non stop action throughout
Before you head in they have a bar inside the theatre, so you can grab a few drinks while you enjoy the show
Besides the action, the show does have some funny parts as well
I was in the 3rd row, which was probably a little too close. I would suggest sitting in the center section, probably 20 rows back or so"
O,It was just ok... there were parts where I almost dozed off. For the cost of the tickets I dont think you get what you pay for.
O,"Love.. Check.
Ka.... Check.
Mystere.... Check.
Zarkana... Check.
O... I can now check this one of my Cirque du Soleil list! 

This particular Cirque show was simply O-utstanding!  If youre stuck trying to decided between the slew of Cirque options in Vegas.....I would suggest you see O or Love - theyre tied for my top spot. I do feel that Love offers more pizzazz  in the acrobatic realm. However, O  delivers an elegant and artistically refined performance that will not disappoint. 

The focus of this aquatic themed show is the breathtaking aerial acrobatics, synchronized swimming, spectacular diving, and a bit of humor. As other reviewers have stated, the stage seamlessly transitions from a pool to a solid surface throughout the performance. It is quite magical. There is so much to see during the performance that you wont know what to look at. The showmanship of the performers is breathtaking!

Go ahead and Treat-Yo-Self to this show. Its worth it. Its Vegas. Youll love it."
O,"Cirque: seen one, seen em all. O is basically the same shit, different day -- this time in water. 

Not to dismiss Cirque; I mean, these are outrageously talented performers performing AMAZING physical feats....but after 4 or 5 variations, the shtick gets monotonous...ya know? Beautiful stage sets, weird costumes, insanely fit Russian and Chinese acrobats, nebulous story line and an overdose of whimsy. 

If I had to choose a Cirque show, Id go with the Beatles or Zumanity -- at least they are substantially different. The rest are more or less the same."
O,I could see this over and over! Love this ! One of my favorite Cirque shows! Very creative and full of imagination!
O,"I will never forget the first time I went to a Cirque show. It was way back in the early 90s when most people (at least in the U.S.) had never heard of the troupe - including me. I was visiting a friend in NYC and her dad gave us tickets. When I looked at them I thought $120 was an awful lot of moola for a silly circus. As I approached the Big Top in Battery Park I began to understand something was different. I think the show was Quidam (or maybe Alegria). I left memorized and with a bagful of expensive Cirque merch as I was certain I would never see anything as amazing again. 

Now, after having seen countless Cirque shows (both touring and those permanently housed in Las Vegas) I can say that O is definitely one of the top 3 Cirque shows ever!

Its hard to believe that Cirque could outdo itself in terms of creativity; however, they succeeded with O. So much so that I have now seen it twice and was even more impressed the second time around. 

O is Cirque meets Water Ballet. I cant think of any other way to describe it. Amazing acrobatics, beautiful costumes and body paint, diving extravaganza....overall surreal serenity. Think vivid imagery similar to those in the film What Dreams May Come. Just doesnt seem real...more like a splendid dream. 

The theater inside the Bellagio was custom built to accommodate this very special show. The performers utilize this circular theater by performing on the stage, as well as the rest of the house (keep your eyes open up and down the isles). Somewhat interactive. On both occasions, my husband and I purchased tickets in section 102 in the wet zone. Fantastic seats and only a few small splashes of water here and there. No worries. And, if you want to spend a little less money, I cant imagine there being a bad seat in the house. JOUIR!"
O,"The worst Cirque show Ive ever seen.

Slow, boring, unenthusiastic - nothing special about the water.

It seems that the multi million dollar stage did most of the work.

I only really enjoyed one of the acts throughout the entire spectacle.

KA at MGM is the way to go - thats a show worth your money."
O,"This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show so I didnt know what to expect or how to compare it to the other shows, but it was AMAZING!! Since then Ive also seen Le Reve and dont think its as good as O.

This show is very acrobatics focused. There is no story but every scene is is like a tiny story, if you will. I really liked the live singers in the booth on the right side of the stage, and the clown scenes were pretty funny too.

Some parts of the show were kind of creepy/weird but still very cool; like one of those real circuses. There was always so much going on I wish I could watch everything at once, but there are just too many people doing too many different things at once. I guess it is part of the overall effect, though.

There are a couple of surprising scenes involving audience interactions, but I wont spoil it for you. The way they open and close the curtains was very innovative and unexpected and fit very well with the whole show. 

Overall I would definitely come again!! So worth the money!

TIP: find seats near the middle/upper sections. Youll be able to see everything going on on stage and wont have to crane your neck to see the first performer descend from the ceiling!"
O,Enough can not be said of this show. Id give it more stars if they were available. We had 5th row (first non splash row) seats but all lower level seats are great. Make sure you are on time because they hold seating once it begins. Worth going more than once.
O,"Amazing performance, I literally gave a standing ovation. The Asian girl were my fav. I would definitely recommend this show."
O,"This finally concludes one of the last shows I have never seen in Vegas, as well one of the only Cirque du Soleil shows I havent seen yet.

I cant find a way to give it 5 stars simply because their proliferate use of actor audience members got really tiring after a while, but I have to say I am extremely impressed by the stage, the show, their entrances and exits and their visual appeal.

The only thing I disliked was that there was a huge lack of storyline. I mean I think they tried but it seemed like they had a small box and tried to cram too much into it. It just didnt work.

Visually, this show is absolutely stunning. Theres nothing short of breathtaking from their acts to their various themes and multiple stage changes throughout the show. I dont know if this show is worth the high price tag that you pay to see it if youre interested in a story line and something coherent to grab onto but its definitely Vegas entertainment at its very best. 

I would say this is a must see show for Vegas, so if you havent seen it, pay up because it is worth seeing at least once."
O,"Ive seen 10+ different Cirque shows leading up this in 3 different countries. And this one certainly lived up to the hype. This was my second Las Vegas Cirque; first being Mystere. For O, we sat in the center, 7 rows from the stage. For the majority of the show, the view was perfect. We did miss a bit of the opening act since it took place above and a bit behind us. In hindsight, the second tier seats would have worked as well."
O,"Im not a big Cirque du Soleil guy, but this show was fantastic.  Ive been to 1 other Cirque show, and I did not find it very enjoyable.  I usually like shows with a more involved story line and music.  For O, everything from the music, to the staging, to the performance, to the story was great.  We had pretty good seats, and I was amazed how the stage was able to change so quickly.

I have not seen the other Cirque shows in Vegas, but I cant imagine they are any better than O.  If you have the opportunity, go see it.  You will not regret it!"
O,Words cant describe what I just saw here last night. Its my first Cirque du Soleil show and I can say they got me hooked! Book this show - its worth every penny!
O,"This show was outstanding from beginning to end.  I couldnt think of one thing to improve on if I had to.  There was constant movement, the characters, stage, and music were beyond outstanding!  If the price were to double, it would still be worth it!!  This is a must see if you come to Vegas"
O,"This was my first show in Vegas and my first show of this kind.  

Now I understand or see where the people on all of the talent shows go to perform and show their skills.  This might sound cheesy but I am admitting that this was something completely new to me.  The incredible acrobatic skills and feats of strength and flexibility are just a few of the amazing acts shown throughout the show.  

This semi-aquatic show is extremely impressive and is really worth all of the money.  Of all of the things that you can spend money on in Vegas I would argue that seeing a show like this is probably the best spent.  You wont have any regret in spending your hard earned dollars on some of the most magnificent displays of art and talent.  The amount of hard work and planning that goes into a show like this well exceeds the price of your ticket.  

This hour and a half or so show will keep you engaged throughout with audience participation and comedic aspects.  The stage itself is tremendously impressive and the engineering that goes into it has to be intricate.  During the show the stage rises and lowers providing different levels of water where underwater acts are performed.  It is truly phenomenal.  

I dont really need to or want to go into detail of any of the acts but I can promise this show will not leave you disappointed."
O,This is probably the best circus shows I have ever seen. Recommended for people of any age. Just an observation - sometimes theres so much action going on the scene your eyes could get lost :)
O,"An Aquatic Masterpiece!
Breathtaking!!
Simply The Best!!!

Short Review:  
This was my first Cirque show in Las Vegas and I gots to say....I had the time of my life. We watched O for Valentines Day and the experience was breathtaking from start to finish.  Theres no sense going to great detail of what youll experience with this show since most of the reviews on here already explain a lot.  Bottom line, Cirque du Soleils O is as good as it gets.

Shorter Review:
Do This!

Longer Review: 
Cirque du Soleils O is performed in Bellagio.  O, French for water, features at least 10 different acts in water, on the ground, and in the air.  Youll experience acts from acrobats, trapeze acts, fire dancing, contortionist, high dives, synchronized swimming, and even some clowns perform. All acts are performed with live music, which is perfectly synchronized with all of the performances. Its really hard to say which of the acts was my favorite because all delivered a performance thats simply magical.  You have to hand it to all the performers.  The strength, the focus, and the grace that these performers exhibit is second to none. I look forward to watch more Cirque shows in the future and will consider the backstage package for O as well.  But dont just take my word for it, check out O for yourself.  


TIP: O performs Wednesday through Sunday with only two performances, 7:30 PM and 10:00 PM.  You can get tickets at one of M Lifes casinos (ie. Excalibur, Luxor, Bellagio, etc) or online.  Unless you have a hook up, general admission per person starts at $108 for Level 4, $119.90 for Level 3, $143 for Level 2, and $170.50 for Level 1.  Because it was my first time and didnt know what to expect, we got seats at Level 1. However, the theater isnt too big and is set up perfectly.  In other words, I think that you can still enjoy the show from Level 4. 


YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (049/366)"
O,"See La Reve at Wynn instead. Disappointed.
We were looking so forward to this show. Had great seats to celebrate our anniversary and were expecting much more. I literally fell asleep. 
The live music was a nice touch but the show was a bit sleepy. We saw La Reve at the Wynn and expected equal or better. And the tickets cost twice as much. Bummer."
O,"Ive seen this show 4-5 times now and its good. Great story line and the stag/production is amazing. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because its not in my top 3 best cirque shows. Having seen 90% of the shows of the Las Vegas strip being a concierge its good but not in my top 3, just being honest."
O,"I really dont know whats up with me,. but I somehow cant get myself to like any of the Cirque shows! Its not that the acrobatics arent phenomenal or that the grandeur is wasted on me. But every single time, I have found something lacking - the storyline.
I have been to multiple shows in Vegas. And Ive covered almost all of the Cirque shows (Only Mystere remains!) Granted that O was the best of the lot, it still doesnt stand a chance compared to La Reve. Both shows are water based. Both shows have been diving into the water from heights unimaginable. But La Reve was incredible. O, in comparison, was a let down.
For the price you pay, it is a bummer. I enjoyed Ka a lot more."
O,"This is my second Cirque du Soleil show and I loved it. Although I didnt fully understand the story plot, I was just fully immersed in all the acrobatics and water action.

The prices do seem a bit pricey, but you can always do some search online and find random deals for as much as 20% off. So this does help a bit.

Also, there is no intermission and its a full 1.5 hours so plan on not going to the bathroom or anything until after the show.

Some of the fillers just didnt fit at all into the whole O experience, but I guess they have to do what they need to do, to get the real acrobats where they need to be. But at least the fillers didnt take up too much time and did not distract you from the main show.

Overall, it was a great experience. I would definitely do this again after I see a few more other Cirque shows just for comparison.

Again, go search for some discounts online!!!"
O,Incredible show. This is the 3rd cirque show Ive seen and it may be the best so far. I loved everything about it. The staging of the water elements are so impeccably timed. Entertainment at its best here. Spend the extra $ to experience O it is so worth it. Also if you are a M-Life member the tickets are greatly discounted at the counter ahead of time. There were better seats available from the counter than there were online as well.
O,"This was an amazing show that was totally a birthday surprise. I had no idea this was on our agenda until we showed up a few minutes from show time. To top it off the GFF got us VIP seating which meant we had private balcony seating all to our selves excluding the millianiel couple who shared our booth. Since they did not say a word it was like we were all by ourselves. The show was spectacular from start to finish blending music, exotic singing, amazing acrobatics and colorful lights and phenomenal waterworks. 

One must be deaf, dumb and blind not to be totally impressed and moved by this outstanding work of art and human achievement. 

To enhance the experience try the Circue French Restaurant also in the Bellagio. Make reservations in advance and try one of their course meals. Simply delicious with service that rivals the finest restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Fantastic show, amazing venue, delicious pre-theatre meal.

5 out of 5 stars."
O,"If youre going to watch one Cirque show in Vegas, make it this one!

Trust, its one of the best Cirque shows ive ever seen on the strip!

From the breathtaking panoramic scenes, amazing set changes, and jaw dropping acrobatic performances, this show is a MUST for any Vegas goer.

The water element was what took this show over the top for me.  Much like Le Reve (not a Cirque Du Soleil affiliated show) it was incredible seeing how the set dynamically changed from dry to wet and even wetter!

Just do yourself a favor and do not, i repeat Do NOT purchase tickets for the front rows. Youll eventually end up breaking your neck trying to see all the aerial performances! For me, the sweet spot for any Cirque Du Soleil show is middle and center. Youre able to see everything comfortably from this vantage point and that IMO is priceless!

With the combination of the inspiring live soundtrack, exotic sets and spectacular performances, i can guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience that you will treasure for years to come!

Happy Times!"
O,"O-mg! What a fantastic combination of performance and set design craftsmanship! 

I came into O with zero expectations. It was the show my group wanted to see, and I since I had no knowledge of the Vegas show scene so I rolled with it. To be honest, in the past Ive never had an interest in seeing a Cirque du Soleil show. I wasnt against them but I just didnt have an large desire to see one. 

However I knew I was in for a thrill the second I walked into the theater. The amphitheater was huge and the faint sound of a drip could be heard in the background of the buzz of conversation. 

Once the curtain opened, the set blew me away. The stage seemingly seamlessly changed from a pool, to a larger pool, to a hard stage floor so many times throughout the performance I would only be able to track the changes if I was  consciously counting the changes. The fact that there was a pool on the stage alone just blew my mind. Now add a cast of talented acrobats, swimmers and divers to the mix and you have something really special. 

There were various movements to the show, none of which I saw had a consistent plot with the exception of the two clowns. The stunts, acrobatics and aquatics were so thrilling it really didnt make a difference that I couldnt follow a specific storyline. I do have to say that I didnt love the two clowns however I guess the rest of the cast needed a rest and a time to change up the set. 

I would love to see a behind the scenes of how this production works. Although there is something to be said about the magic of my imagination. 

Despite a steep price tag for the ticket, O is worth the visit."
O,"I saw O many years ago from the cheap seats after a full day of partying and I hardly remembered anything. Recently, I saw it from a back seat in the lower orchestra and I have to say that it is awesome. Its a fever dream combined with another fever dream. I loved it. It barely eeks out my other favorite show, Absinthe, based on sheer scale. I wish I could say that every seat in the house is a winner but that just isnt true."
O,"First of all I liked to thank the management of The Bellagio because I misplaced my Cirque De Soleil ticket at the Casino and they immediately called me since it was forwarded to their lost and found department. Thank you so much for the honesty and fast communication.

For the show, they delivered as what we expected. I liked it because it was indeed an entertainment, circus and show at the same time. I liked the choreography, music, production and how graceful the performers are. I was amazed that there was a pool in the stage lol. Would I recommend the show? Yes I will. :)"
O,"What a show! Id never seen a Cirque du Soleil show and this was the one I wanted to see!

We stayed at the Hotel which made seeing a 10 PM show on a Saturday evening pretty easy. 

The theatre is beautiful, well designed for the show. We sat on the far side in a section with slightly less expensive seats. The theatre was less than half full...though there were quite a few people right around us.

As soon as the show started and the lights went down, most of those around us got up and moved to better seats. It was strange, it was like everyone knew the trick...everyone but us!

The show is very good, entertaining, dazzling, some moves took your breath away. The storyline was...hard to follow. Okay, I wish Id had more to drink or something, maybe it would have made more sense. 

But in the end, it didnt matter. It was an awesome show that stretched the boundaries of what we thought was possible with every scene."
O,"I have been wanting to see this show for YEARS!!! It is one of the more expensive Cirque shows here in LAs Vegas, and now I see why.

From start to finish it is a living, breathing piece of art. So much to look at!  So many exquisite visual moments. It was amazing! As I sat there in awe, all I could think of was the list of loved ones I would like to share this incredible show with!!

The show itself is a visual masterpiece! Not typical of other Cirque shows that will focus on one act or two on stage. O has the acts happening, with a ton of other stuff going on simultaneously. It is so alive with motion, amazing costumes, aquatic shenanigans, stages coming in and up and out of the water, water levels rising and falling. It is almost visual overload, but not because there is a harmony to the entire production.

I you live or or are visiting, trust me when I say this is a really special show. Worth every penny of the high price tickets."
O,This show was amazing. Id seen it on Netflix but it was so much better live. The show that gets put on is magical some of the things they do seem terrifying to watch but its executed flawlessly and the show goes on. A must see here if youre in Vegas
O,"I have not seen any other Cirque du Soleil shows. I have only seen a handful of musicals because usually shows do not interest me. But then I heard the hype about the O show...and it was spot on.

This show was ridiculous. It was colorful eye candy with an amazing score and the most athletic (yet graceful) performers ever. I was absolutely blown away. This show was much more than expected, even with the hype. I didnt really understand the story line at all but appreciated the stunts!

TIP: Main doors open 1 hour prior to show time, but the show doors dont open until 30 minutes before
TIP: There is no intermission, so use the restroom beforehand you fools!"
O,This is the show thats on my list for the longest time and I guess I just set my expectation too high especially I just watched reve the dream the night before so im kind of disappointed...its still good but just not as good as I thought it would be...and there seems to be no connection between acts to acts...just a series of random acts...not something I would go back to
O,"Totem, O, Mystere, Zumanity, LOVE, ONE, serously any of the Cirque du Soleil shows are a hit. They house some of the most creative imaginative people in the world! If you want to be taken away and mystified into a dream world then goto a Cirque du Soleil show. They travel around too with smaller shows, but in Las Vegas they have ongoing performances all year round that are gigantic and glitzy. 

Its perfect for families, no nudity or anything, just lots of talent and creativity channeled to the audience. Ive been privileged to goto Cirque du Soleil shows throughout my entire life, I can honestly say that they still impress me even now as a full grown adult as much as they did when I was 9. 

Tickets are expensive, but there are a lot of third party ticket vendors in Las Vegas, so your chances of getting a slightly discounted ticket are high! Just ask around and stay alert. Zumanity is very sensual, maybe you wouldnt want to bring your kids to that one. O is geared towards a broader audience from kids to adults. Its a family show."
O,By far one of the most amazing shows Ive ever seen. So much talent goes into this production. I didnt want the experience to be over. I was taken aback by all the beauty that fills the stage. If I am ever in Vegas again this show will be on the top of my list of must-dos!
O,"My friend really wanted to see this and she finally got a chance to get tickets. I was a bit disappointed. I have to agree with some that it was a bit all over the place and not much of a storyline. There was some parts that were good, but not as engaging as Mystere to me."
O,"Its been a year since I watched this --- but I still feel the same all these months later. This is an excellent Cirque show!! 

Its my favorite after ONE. Its a water show and much of the time I kept wondering how did they do that? I would see it again in a heart beat. We were on the very last row up top - but still could see everything. Its an immersive experience. Highly recommend this. Its one of the more expensive shows -- but worth it!"
O,"Im giving this 4 stars because the performers are top notch.

But I was glad it was over. I felt I have seen better at shows such as KA and Mystere, even Ovo &amp; Totem.

Big production and staff is great, but intimate settings are better.

For the price you pay here I would pay for KA and this is just expensive for being Bellagio. Lets just face the fact that its the location.

For what the price you pay, I wanted to be wowed, Cirque Du Soleil does wow me, but this show didnt probably because some of the show is repeated.

Im glad I saw it with my own eyes, now I can say I have seen it an was just ok with the performance."
O,"So you would have to be a real jerk to give this show a bad review so I will give it 5 stars. 5 stars because the water is amazing and the functionality of the stage and props not to mention the performers are again amazing. I have seen La Nouba, Love, Mystere, Zumanity, Totem and now O. They all get a 5 star review if you ask me but for the record this was not my favorite. This particular Cirque Du Soleil lacks the humor and the crowd interaction that some of the  other shows have. In the Vegas area I think Zumanity is my favorite and when it comes to the traveling shows I really liked Totem ."
O,"I have no earthly idea exactly what the storyline was supposed to be - everything Ive read says that this production was intentionally made that way so each viewer could interpret it their own way - and it was amazing. 

There was so much going on that youre not quite sure where to look. You could see this show several times and see something new every time. 

We would see it again in a heartbeat."
O,"This was my very first Cirque du Soleil show and I cant say it was worth it. My boyfriend saw KA on his last trip so I choose this one since it is one of the top shows and he hadnt seen it either. While the acrobatics and synchronized swimming was pretty impressive, I feel like the show was a bit boring. I was hoping for more action and excitement. I was actually falling asleep! I guess I had more expectation for the price and the hype. Wont see it again. Wouldnt recommend it either. Our cab driver back to our hotel recommended the MJ show which was my second choice but only choose O because of the reviews. Oh well, while in Vegas- you gamble."
O,We were very disappointed in this show.  It is very strange and not funny.  It is almost the same act over and over just in different outfits and different props.  While you wait for the dancers to change their outfits you have to watch two clowns that are strange and not funny at all.  Dont waste the money.  We spent 777.00 for four people and we are just sick about it.
O,"Simply put...amazing, outstanding, worth every penny! 

So far I have seen Beatles Love (also really good), Mystere (did not like) and this show. This one tops them all! 

I didnt care too much for the clown type skits, but better than just having an intermission. 

We had top row balcony seats on the side. It hurt my back to lean over the railing and not sit back in my seat (dont worry no one was behind me, kind of hard to explain), which was the only real disappointment, but the view was so so worth it!!! We got to see the stage changing as the water depth changed and truly appreciated all of the hard work that went into the show. My boyfriend and I didnt want it to end!"
O,"Its hard to put in to words how absolutely amazing this show is! All the performers are so incredibly talented- all of their stunts and acts would be impressive as they are, but the added element of water takes the show to an unparalleled level. O really offers everything you could want- there were moments I had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard, moments that I struggled to control my racing heart because the performances were so extreme, and everything in between. If you have the opportunity to see O, DEFINITELY see it!! It exceeds all the hype!"
O,"I am not given to superlatives, but O is easily the best show in Las Vegas, and possibly the best in the world.  But if you take my word for it and go with expectations of the unbelievable, you may be disappointed.  And you may resent the substantial amount of dough you plunked down for tickets.

On the other hand, if you go without SPECIFIC expectations and just let the experience wash over you, not trying to follow the story line -- which doesnt exist in any case -- you most likely will leave with a grin on your face, a smile in your heart, and a five star review forming in your head.  Its happened to me four times over the years.

Here are a few hints --

THE DOS:
1.  The best seats are around the tenth to fifteen rows (row one is indeed A here), and not towards the sides.  The main theater consists of sections 101 - 105, with 103 being the center.  102 and 104 are also fine.  Order way ahead - O often sells out.
2.  I like the 10:00 time better because this is a stream-of-conciousness type of show and a couple of drinks (just a couple) frees the mind.  You can buy them just outside the theater and carry them in if you want.
3.  Experience the theater itself - it is a wonder.  O could not be performed effectively without this super-venue.

THE DONTS:
1.  Dont worry about the two clown routines, which are somewhat sophomoric.  They are needed to provide rest for the cast and a chance to change scenes.  Youll see why the rest is needed.
2.  Dont focus entirely on the main performers.  Each scene has a focal point, but there will also be other things happening all over the stage.  These are an important part of the whole, so let your eyes take in the entire flow of the action.
3.  Dont try to understand the lyrics -- consider it an sort of extra-galactic opera.

By the way, O is a Cirque de Soliel show, of which there are five or six running in Las Vegas.  There is a simple way of determining which are the best: the shorter the name, the better the show.  O is #1, followed by Ka, Love, etc.  Forget about Zumanity.

And guys, if you are taking a date, O in Las Vegas is as near a sure thing as there is."
O,"O is an absolutely magnificent show with all the bells and whistles that youd expect from a world class Cirque. I have seen most of the cirques in Vegas and a lot around the world and O really sticks out above the rest. The acrobatics and overall storyline is wonderful and visually stunning. Make sure you book seats ahead of time as weekends can get sold out quickly. Overall, highly recommended to anyone looking to be amazed.

Cons-
A bit pricey"
O,"O-Mazing production. A show I want to see over and over again!!! We had front row seats, sometimes it was a bit difficult to see everything going on but still loved the production."
O,"Given that I got the tickets as a comp. Its around $170 per person. I will still have to rate it as if I shelled out the money. About 45 mins through the show, all of a sudden, theres a voice message stating that they are experiencing difficulty and that they are doing their best to fix the issue and to stay put and they will set to begin in a few mins, 30 mins or so after, thats when they start from what they left of. So if Im paying for the show, theres 30 mins of nothing but sit. NOTHING!!! No return tickets. 
If Im paying $170, its worth only half, probably less."
O,"Not my favorite Cirque du Soleil show, but its an okay show.

There is not a lot of a story line to the show, at least not one as memorable as some of the others Ive seen.  The high dives and some of the water tricks were pretty amazing, but I found myself often getting bored in the show.  

The theater is beautiful, and the costumes and makeup are right on par, but in the end, I wasnt really impressed overall.  I find that I usually forget to breathe during their shows, but this one wasnt really as such.

It was a solid show.  Definitely a good show, but for my money?  Id probably prefer to go elsewhere on the strip for a better Cirque show.  (Make sure you use an M Life card when purchasing your tickets.  Best deal I could find on them!)"
O,"Amazing worth every penny! about 90 minutes no intermission. Really talented people.

Only downside is if your seat is next to a bunch of loud partying drunks which is what happened to me and the ushers wont do anything to help. I spent about $350.00 for two lower seat tickets but you can find cheaper and all seats appeared to be pretty good."
O,"I know Im not the first person to say this, but this show is pretty O-mazing! ;D

This was my very first Cirque du Soleil show and now Im officially inspired to watch many more. Im not sure what I can talk about that wont spoil the show for you but I will say that if you can sit in rows 3-5, you will have a really good eye-level view of the stage. We sat in the third row which is considered a splash zone but we got nothing more than a mist.

I once took synchronized swimming when I was 12 years old and the coaches told us that a really good synchronized swimmer can hold her breath for up to 3 minutes. I think these performers held their breaths way longer than that and Im still attempting to figure out how they stayed underwater for so long!

The ariel performers make what they do look easy and they do it a billion feet up in the air! Ok, maybe a billion is exaggerating but you get the idea :) Im especially impressed by all the catapulting and high diving.

The clowns were kinda adorable. I usually think clowns are scary but these clowns made me smile :)

The stage, set design, and set changes were very innovative. There is a pool in the middle of the stage that disappears and changes to a dry stage via moving platforms that float in and out with such fluidity.

Theres a lot going on during the show so if I were to watch this show again I would probably see something that I didnt catch last time. Much respect to the performers, musicians, stage crew, and all involved in this production. Good show! :)"
O,"I loved it.

I just came back after spend nearly $230 and it was well worth it.  The clowns make the show - from the clown that gets hit with the hammer multiple times to the sinking boat.    The visuals will just take you away.  For me - what I also loved was the music..now I have to get the CD.  I was in row O and it perfect.  Now I want to see the other shows."
O,"This show had me intrigued from start to finish. The costumes alone were enough to draw my interest. I definitely loved the water element to the show and I think it added something that the other shows dont have. The performers are amazing at what they do and the show is non-stop once it starts. This show in particular has so many amazing feats occurring simultaneously that I couldnt do anything other than sit in amazement. Its definitely one of the pricier Cirque shows, but absolutely worth it."
O,We saw the show for the second time recently. This is a must do attraction while in Las Vegas. The best Cirque show by far... Although all are fantastic
O,"what an amazing show!  its got to be the most expensive cirque show ive been to for where i was seated (balcony - 203), but i can still see the stage pretty well.  ive seen almost every show that came to our area, which tends to be smaller.  but the O stage was seriously amazing, and i see why they wouldnt be traveling.  the water area comes and goes with each act, and the set is just beautiful even though the theater itself is a little old.  this is my second cirque show within 7 days of each other (luzia being the first one before i came to vegas for O).  so i was able to compare the experience.  i loved being closer in luzia, but the acts that integrate water element in O are simply amazing (although luzia also had a little water).  i would definitely recommend seeing the show.  get tickets early!"
O,This show was more than I ever expected. The production is exceptional and the performers are EXCELLENT even the 2clowns. The way they incorporated water into the show sets this apart from all the other Cirque show you can choose from.
O,"O is the most expensive cirque show in Las Vegas. I had high expectation about the show. I give it only 2 stars because i think it is over rated. First, the flow of the whole show has no coordination. Stunts/Actors would just pop out anywhere and theres no story to follow. Their stunts were amazingly daring and i liked it. However, it is the nature and overall plot that is hard to understand.. The clowns were not even funny.. 
I have seen Le Reve at Wynn Hotel TWICE! It is by far the most awesome show in Vegas! Theres a story in the show and they truly unveil the beauty of imagination! Its like a dream within a dream! The lighting effects, water stage, and actors were superb! I would suggest that if you are torn between Le Reve and O, i highly recommend u watch Le Reve first!"
O,This is an amazing show and well worth the ticket prices. Did I follow the plot no not at all but the performers and stage are amazing. They are all very gifted in gymnastics diving or some other unique talent. The hardest part was figuring out who to watch. The first few rows might get wet but other than the very front corners I dont think there could be a bad seat in the house.
O,"My husband and I have seen Ka, Le Reve, Mystere, Zarkana and now O.

O is definitely as amazing as the other Cirque shows (although Le Reve is not Cirque but its the same thing). You cant go wrong with this show.

However if you had to chose between this and Le Reve I recommend the latter. O theater is HUGE meaning more possibility for bad seats where as Le Reve is in a circle with 10-12 rows so there are no bad seats. I felt like O had less stunts then other shows. And Le Reve has a story line where as this does not. 

Regardless this was money well spent and it was just amazing! Absolutely beautiful and a lot of attention on the musicians which I appreciated. 

You will not regret seeing this show!"
O,O-M-G!!! So amazing. We scored 7th row tickets for 20% off and it was the best! I had never seen a Cirque show and this one set a high standard.
O,"This is a show I rant and rave to everyone about.  It truly is a piece of beauty and art.  The stage alone deserves a 5 star review because it is simply amazing.  

The show has a great balance of mediums with acrobatics, dancers, synchronized swimmers, and the list goes on and on.  

Highlights include:
Everything!

Low point:
Nothing!"
O,"O is the epitome of the perfect Cirque de Soleil show and hands down the best show on the Las Vegas strip. Its an aquatic cirque show with incredible acrobatic performances and breathtaking music. Even the clown acts were entertaining. Ive seen many cirque shows on the strip and am also guilty of sometimes snoozing off during shows (I hate to admit this, but its a dark room and the musics very calming!) I have watched O twice and was 100% awake both times. :)

O also has a lot of impressive performances/acts while some other cirques do not. I dont want to go into detail of the specifics of the show - you will have to go watch and find out for yourself! Definitely worth your time and money."
O,Pretty cool! Still not sure how they did the water on stage like that.  I would get a close seat if possible.  Lots of diving.
O,"This was an amazing show. The best cirque show by far! There were so many aspects to the show. There was a bit of comedy, romance, acrobats, body contortionist, and many more. I would give a longer review, but I do not want to give anything away! Just go see it!! Its the most expensive one, but totally worth it!"
O,"Ive been wanting to see O since the last time I went to Vegas 5 years ago.  It was definitely worth the wait! The showmanship and athleticism was beyond amazing! The faith the performers have in each other and the set changes happening appropriately left me in awe.  Its pretty much indescribable.  I also loved the clowns in between set changes that kept thing entertaining from the very beginning. The only thing that would have made this show even better would have been a storyline - even a very loose one.  This show is definitely worth the cost and a must-see in Vegas!

Definitely recommend getting tickets in advance since popular times may have limited availability.  Also, you can probably score some deals online to save a few bucks."
O,"Before O, Ive only seen one Cirque du Soleil show which was a traveling show called Corteo.  While that was impressive, O offers you something of a much larger scale.  Lots of water and acrobatics!  Feels pretty magical.

If youre not willing to pay the prices for the very front or risk getting wet, I would suggest aiming for the front row in the middle section.  Beware that there is a railing so if you sit short then it might obstruct your view.  For us, it was fine and you get more leg space.

I walked by the half price ticket booths a couple times and saw a couple of the other Cirque shows but didnt see O listed so buy your tickets beforehand if youre set on seeing this one."
O,"The most amazing show Ive ever seen. Imagine the most opening olympic acrobatics, all conducted in water. Definitely the MUST SEE Cirque du Soleil while in vegas"
O,"Beautiful theater, beautiful scenery, perfectly executed... But my party of 4 just didnt get it.  I dont like to rain on all of the great reviews posted here.  The show felt to me like it lacked  a story.  We all walked out of there saying, what was that?.

I saw all of the great reviews, we were really excited for the show, we were all set but were disappointed.  Better luck next time..."
O,"We spent about 90 percent of the show trying to figure out how the stage was moving, where the props were going, how they could dive from such a height into such a tiny space... So much going on at every second, well worth the wait, and a beautiful way to experience Vegas! 

Make time for this one!"
O,"I am a self-confessed Cirque nut. I actually cannot remember the first show I ever saw...either Quidam or Mystere. In either case, dont ask me how many Cirque shows I have seen...and in how many cities...

But this one bested even Ka for me, held my breath throughout so much of the stunner. Knocks the wind right out of you,...really does. The water stunts and amazing lung capacity of the athlete/ artists.....wowzahs...

My special guy has seen both water shows, and says I wont have any problem saying Le Reve is even better. We have tickets in a few months, which gave me pause to review one of my all-time fave Cirque shows.

PS Was my least favorite Kooza, or Corteo...?"
O,"Best Cirque du Soleil show I have seen yet, combining the artistry/visuals seen in the newer shows (i.e. LOVE) with amazing acrobatic acts as in the older shows (i.e. Zarkana). 

I know why tickets are so expensive now. How does anyone come up with an idea like this? Water never looked so elegant. Oh the things you can create with water! The artistry from the second they pull back and whisk away the red curtain to reveal the stage of water; I was captivated from the beginning to the end of this show. It just cant be summed up in this review, but wow. 

TIP: Pretty much any seat will do in this theater, but I think upper orchestra is probably the best as it is not too close. I think its best not to sit up front for these shows as there is so much to take in, actors walking around the aisles, things flying overhead, etc. DO NOT sit in the first row of sections 201 (seats 1-3) and 205 (seats 1-3). I dont know if they actually sell these seats but they should not. There is a handrail there that will block your view. Luckily I realized that I was in the wrong seat because I almost cried if I had to sit there."
O,"Just a spectacular show.  It was my second time seeing O and my sons first time.  Of the two we saw, O and LOVE, O was by far his favorite.  With 832 other reviews, its hard to come up with anything unique or new here so lets just leave it at - Go, you will not be disappointed.

At least I kept it together and didnt cry at how beautiful it was like I did the first time I saw 9 or so years ago!"
O,"I took my mom to see Iris awhile back and she loved it! And seeing how much I was raving about it, she decided to surprise me with tickets to O this time! She is so wonderful!

I love love loved it! It was almost the same concept but just in water. But wow talk about breathtaking! The performers were all so beautiful and the music was just so soothing and fun! There was a beginning act with clowns, and Im usually afraid of clowns, but these two were just too cute and refreshing! They added the right amount of comedy to the show.

Definitely a show I would love to watch again! :)"
O,"Im a fan of many Cirque du Soleil shows and have seen quite a few - Ka, Love, and Mystere, and O can be reviewed a couple of different ways.

1) Versus the other hydro-centric show, Le Reve. I saw Le Reve three nights after O. Long story short: Le Reve is better. Le Reve is a more intimate stage as the audience sits around the pool 360 degrees. Le Reve had less clown time. And Le Reve had more action / acrobatics. Its a no-brainer. Whats sad is we saw O on a Wed night and Le Reve on a Sat night and, despite having hundreds more seats, O was far more packed than Le Reve. Brand recognition does matter.

2) Versus its price. O is expensive - outrageously expensive. Tickets are almost $200 (best Le Reve tickets are about $115). Its not worth it. There are too many other entertainment options on The Strip for a fraction of that price (e.g., Absinthe or Le Reve). Fortunately we paid $70 via Craigslist.

O is not bad. You might even like it if you love fancy costumes and surreal motions that leave most people saying, WTF? But if you want action, acrobatics, and more intimate setting at a fraction of the price, go see Le Reve (or Absinthe, the best show on The Strip, and I have seen over 15)."
O,"Saw the show on Saturday, Dec 27, 2014.

4 stars because Im sure you will like it.  I personally was disappointed.  Of all the Cirque du Soleil shows, this one is never discounted much.  Ive seen Mystere, Ka, Le Reve, Believe (UGH!), Zumanity, and Totem (in LA)... O, Ive been saving for a special occasion.

The good:
- I heard there were no bad seats; true.  We sat up at the top and no complaints here.
- I was simply in love with their soundtrack.
- The stage and costumes were beautiful, but...

The bad:
- I heard the water stage was awesome, but I imagined it would be some crazy water tank where most of the acts were of the underwater choreography type... sometimes its good to do a little research beforehand

Oops, I guess that was really the only bad thing.  I totally admit it was my own set of expectations for the show that led to my disappointment, coupled with the high cost of tickets.  I feel like you can get a better bargain (at least for those whove never seen a Cirque show), watching Ka (whose rotating platform is also quite impressive)."
O,Absolutely stunning! The show is very intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The scenery and costumes are beautiful and full of intricate detail. Id highly recommend making this show part of your Vegas experience!
O,"I have to say for my first Cirque du Soleil show, I was taken back by just all the visual appeal! So much symbolism and beauty, everything from how the curtain came down and back up, to the random pop-up of characters and the colors and shapes of their costumes. 

Though there is no main story that is strikingly apparent, there are some things that tie into each scene and its sometimes hard to capture those little moments since there is so much going on the sidelines, background, in the air and also in the water. Just from a theatrical standpoint, that revolving pool and stage was amazing!!!! I wonder how long it took to come with the mechanics and choreography for all their pieces.

The acrobatics and death-defying stunts of course, were spectacular. Im not a fan of clowns so when that portion came about, it was not as terrifying as I thought. The one scene I truly enjoyed was the Polynesian fire dancers. Not only did they includes some moves and tricks Ive never seen before, but one the of the dancers had the beautiful traditional Samoan tattoo.

I cant wait to watch the other shows!"
O,"Loved O!  

Lets be honest-  CDS shows are all kind of the same.  So far, Ive seen Le Mystere, Iris, and O.  Ive also seen the Chinese circus several times and a lot of it is much of the same.

Id been wanting to watch O for years but balked at the high price of the tickets.  Definitely the highest priced of the CDS shows, but worth it IMO.  The water/pool adds an additional element to the show that makes it a lot more exciting to watch and creates a lot of sequences/acts/effects that are impossible in other shows.

I really enjoyed O and highly recommend it.  Definitely my fav CDS show so far."
O,"Hands down the most exciting, impressive, and magical show Ive ever seen. It was beautiful, and the performances were jaw dropping... I couldnt believe the things they were doing! Definitely a must-see. In fact, I think well go again."
O,"Best Cirque du Soleil production ever!  The star of the show is the water stage.  I loved how the water tank would be deep one moment, and gone the next.  The water stage also gives performers a new route for exiting the stage - underwater.  I was fascinated by the engineering throughout the show.

I am not a huge fan of the acrobatics, though.  A lot of the moves look to me like gymnastics with better decorations.  Maybe I am jaded, but I have been to several gymnastics meets for free, and seen routines that are just as challenging, if not more.  

Nevertheless, I am glad I finally caught the show after many failed attempts on prior trips.  But with kids in tow on this trip, I wasnt going to be distracted by the gaming tables or bars."
O,"My husband and I were vacationing in Vegas for the first time and wanted to see some amazing shows. Weve seen Cirque du Soleil Ovo and Kooza and were eager to see another. I heard from some friends that O was a must see. Its expensive! But I found that it was worth it.

From beginning to end, the show is amazing. Make sure to get your tickets early because seats go fast. Our trip was in June and I barely was able to find tickets 2 months before.

I cant even describe it... water, mystery, acrobatics, comedy, fire, suspense, singing, beauty, fear.  Yep. Amazing. A must see."
O,"This show is so much fun! The stage set up is incredible.  Enjoyed the plot, although it was tougher to follow than KA. 

One thing I could have done without are the clowns. I dont find them humorous but that might just be my particular sense of humor. 

Would recommend to anyone in Vegas."
O,"Simply AMAZING!! This is my first Cirque Du Soleil show, and boy did it set the bar high! I was seat in 204 row Q seats 3&amp;4, seats are normally 180.45$ with tax and fees and those seats were pretty perfect! You can pay the same and sit in lower orchestra, but do not expect to call a few days before the show and get amazing seats in L/O, PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS EARLY! Also, look online for promos(usually a 20% off) and CALL to get your tickets! This way you can actually choose your seat!! (Ok, I actually work in the contact center, so you may speak to me!!) 

ONTO the show! So its recommended to pick up your tickets AT LEAST 1 HR EARLY TO AVOID LINES! ALSO DO NOT GO LATE, YOU WILL BE HELD BACK FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PERFORMERS IN THE OPENING ACT! We were seated and the excitement came over me! Ive never seen any show, so this was my first! Word of advice, if you get cold easy, TAKE A SMALL SWEATER! It gets cold in here! So 2 clowns came out to entertain the guests whilst seating began, I normally am not easy to make laugh, but these guys sure did! They were silly and a great way of not having to just sit there waiting. People say they were not funny, but those people probably have a stick up their butt bc they were pretty silly! Besides, this was an added bonus aka intermission for the performers to transition outfits and make up. Give them a chance!

So the show starts and I was in awe, the ceiling is stunning blue and green and down comes a performer. She was amazing and flawless, such a sight! So out come other performers running around the theater, and so the show begins! Amazing acrobats, I found out the 2 girls who perform trapeze are actually sisters! AMAZING! They were soo athletic and seriously amazing! Depending on the day you go it will either be these 2 or a single girl doing this act, both are amazing! The stage is insane, its a rising stage, so it goes from being a pool to shallow water to a solid stage, AMAZING TRANSITIONS! In addition to that the drapes and entire area is just breath taking! The water changes colors and the performers know cues from the music that plays (underwater as well!) seriously amazing!

This show has many different amazing acts and the story line is of Philemon being lost in the world of O, it follows the story line very well IMO, displaying the wonderful world of O.

My favorite acts (all of them really!) were:
Russian Swing
Aerial hoops
Barge
High dive and
Fire

They also have a Washington trapeze, she was amazing! Bateau act, sync swimming, and contortion. All these acts were awesome, but I loved the others a lot more! I also loved the horses at the beginning of the show, soo cool and cute! The clown act was a fun act, they were very funny and kept me awake. Another neat thing is all the music is performed by a live orchestra! Its like you get 2 shows for the price of 1!! Theyre very good and the singer has an amazing voice!

Interesting facts: O has many Olympians and some are even gold medalists! The pool at its deepest area is 25 feet deep and uses 1.5million gallons of water! Every performer is scuba certified! This show is one of the more popular show bc any person can follow the story line, there isnt any english in the show so everyone can understand the show! Awesome!!

Its a pricey show, but its seriously worth every penny! Like I said before, check online the cirque website for special offers! Everyone who can appreciate an amazing show full of exquisite athletes should see this!  I did go at 10pm and it was a little late for me (Im like an old grandma and need sleep! The show lasts 1.5 hrs so be prepared!!)"
O,I saw this show about 15 years ago and they still put on an amazing show.   The suspense still got me.  I took my 19 year old daughter and she did say someday she will take her kids to see it.
O,"This was our first Cirque du Soleil performance, and we werent disappointed! The acrobatic skills and the choreography was absolutely amazing. We bought front row seats on the mezzanine level, which I thought were perfect as you can see the performance in the water, which I doubt we could have seen if we had been seating at ground level. 

The usage of water and fire were cleverly done, I loved the hilarious clowns in between the acrobats, and the singers voice was ethereal and angelic.

I cant wait to see my next Cirque du Soleil show!"
O,"Dull, slow paced, over priced, and elegant are the 4 words that come to mind when I think of O. The script is completely up to interpretation and the pacing is all over the place. IT IS SO SLOW!!! So slow paced that a women in front of me fell asleep! The acts were nice to watch but the energy was down half the time obviously because of the lackluster pacing. The clowns were not funny in the slightest. I laughed because I felt bad. The price is way to expensive! I wouldnt spend more then 50 bucks to see this show and I paid almost triple that. The only thing that saved this show was its elegance and that is one thing that O does do well. But I felt the mood was not set like other cirque shows such as Zumanity which I felt was far superior to O and cheaper. As much as I love elegance I dont think its worth paying 150 dollars for 90 minutes of it."
O,"I dont get it. I really dont. What is all the hype about with this show?

O is considered to be one of the top shows in Vegas but I found it to be the worst show Ive seen so far. And Ive seen about a dozen shows in Vegas.

Granted, the stage is amazing but the show itself is terribly boring. It mainly consists of glorified synchronized swimming and diving, 2 sports I avoid watching during the Summer Olympics. So why should I pay $150 a ticket to watch it live?

There was an act where a half dozen performers swung around on some wire grid in and took turns diving into the water. After they were done, they posed and waited for applause. For what, I have absolutely no clue. Anyone could have done what they did.

Even the clowns werent funny. All of their jokes were painfully obvious.

I had never been as bored in a show as much as I was in O and considering its high price tags, I was very disappointed. If youre looking for a Cirque show in Vegas, One, Mystere and Ka are all better by far.

O may have been amazing when it opened about 15 years ago but now it lacks any kind of creativity, energy and awe factor. It was a giant waste of time."
O,"Fabulous.  We had seats way up in the center of the balcony.  At first, I thought it would be too far away to see, but the seating was actually great.  The first act, a trapeze artist, came down right in front of us.  She was amazingly dexterous and balanced on her head.  The show had its funny parts, but the real  interesting part was the stage...  Sometimes it was full of water and choreographed actors swimming, and then, the stage was clear of water.  Within moments.  The lower stage must have a fancy elevator system that pumps the water quickly.  Full enough to dive from a a few stories high, then dry enough to walk upon...  Rainfall and umbrellas...  There was always something to see.  The drinks were expensive... A 12 ounce Coors Light can cost $8.50!  It was hard to consider tipping the waiter at that price!  They also sell theater food, like popcorn, but we dont patronize that concession.  The music seemed to be live as we saw singers and musicians in the booth to the right side of the stage.  The other side had sound mixing and who knows what else.  It was packed, so make your reservations early.  Things were going on all over the stage so watch carefully.  It cost a lot but it was well worth it.  The show was about 1 1/2 hours long, but so entertaining that I forgot the time.  I wonder if the water is heated a bit as the actors were in and out of the water constantly.  It was about $125 per ticket, plus resort fees and taxes but well worth the expense."
O,"We had an amazing evening, three rows from the stage right in the center it was as if we transcended ourselves into the performance we were so close.  Truly captivating."
O,"There arent many acrobatics, period. What you see in the trailer is all you get in the show.
I see that the stage is well thought through. It must have been made with a fortune too. I also see that the performers and crews have a lot of work to do backstage. However, I still had to see more acrobatics. : ( 
I would have appreciated O much more if it were to be any show other than Cirque Du Soleil. 
FYI... Too dark for kids... I personally felt like the story is all about death and afterworld..."
O,"Great show by Cirque. There are some that I could do without, but others seem to fly by and leave me wanting more. This is definitely a I want to see this again kind of show. 

The story is simple and enjoyable (or so complex that I didnt get it), but there were a number of reoccurring characters that were fun and funny.  The clowns were great, the circus master (assuming that was his role) was eccentric and dark and yet humorous.  

We had a great time and we will probably recommend this show to others."
O,"Other than the clown element, I really enjoyed O.  Fire, water, and acrobatics all made for an enjoyable performance.  However, if there was a story, I had no idea what it was.  But to be fair, we sat in the VIP suites at the back of the theater.  Private suites that seat four (although we had only two in our party) with a bottle of champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries and truffles.  So I probably spent more time counting how many chocolates my husband was taking over his 50% than paying attention.

The private entrance came in handy when my husband claimed he set an alarm for 6 pm and yet I woke up at 7:10 wondering why I was so well-rested.  After the fastest costume change ever, we literally ran to the theater and arrived just after it started, but did not disturb anyone.  The cocktail server whisked in just behind us to open the champagne.  I was miffed at my husband for missing the chance to get our photo, but a photographer came to our suite before I had a chance to start bitching.  

Sadly, the $335 per ticket price did not include a photo, which I looked hideous in, but yet I still felt compelled to buy both for $90 so I could study at my leisure which one was less ghastly.  I am just grateful he told me to pose in such a way to hide the arm fat.  I later got an email that I could buy a digital download which I would have rather done to begin with so I could work my wonders with Photoshop.  So before you buy a photo with the stupid album you might not want anyway, ask if you can just fill out the card with your email address for the download.  

I probably wouldnt see O again, but I thought it was a great show and really enjoyed the suite!"
O,"Eh.  It was just ok.  I liked Ka far better.  The story was non existent, the clown acts went on FAR too long (I didnt pay that much money to watch four grown men slow dancing with each other, and plus they were not even funny), and the ticket prices! OMG!  Looking around online, the cheapest I was able to find was about $150 plus taxes.  So about $380/couple, ouch!  I kept thinking to myself when the show was gonna be over.

Now the stage is really cool, but the overall show was just alright, and bc of the price and annoying clowns, I cant give this more than two stars.  And the fake audience members they pick out to be in the show doesnt fool anyone.   I was very surprised the show got a standing ovation."
O,"You know, having never been to a Cirque du Soleil performance before, I was really skeptical about dishing out close to two hunnerd clams to see a bunch of Canadians prancing about in tights.  There was bound to be mincing.  And someone mentioned clowns.  Oh boy.  But, on the recommendation of a whole lot of people, I bought us some tickets to take a gander.

Holy crap -- this was an amazing performance.  From the startling open reveal to the equally stunning closing bit, I enjoyed every minute.

Even the clowns.

Its quite impressive to see the physical acts that the human body is capable of.  Trapezes, high dives, contortionists, guys on fire -- its all there somewhere.

We sat kind of near the back and still had a good view of the stage -- I dont think theres a bad seat in the house -- but it would be REALLY cool to be up close in the middle of the front sections.  So buy your tickets as early as possible."
O,"I really enjoyed watching this at the Bellagio during our recent Vegas trip. I cant believe we didnt see it sooner. Although, if youre scared of clowns/circus related things, you might want to skip this one. 

The show is about 1 hour 1/2 long and consists a lot of acrobatic moves with water and fire. The performers dive from really high up into the water while other performers are underwater doing their own moves. The costumes that were created for this show is very unique. If youre in Vegas, watch this."
O,"O.....what a disappointment. As a long time fan of Cirque productions, this was a true let down. At first, I was mesmerized when the curtains drew back and the stage was seen in all its majesty and fantasy. I was sure this would be the best Cirque performance ever. 

It was all downhill from there. The production value was unmatched, unlike anything Ive seen before. Thats the good. Now the bad: Cirque performances, with all their fantasy and surrealism, still contain a story with a protagonist and antagonist, were there is the buildup of conflict, and subsequent resolution. This story did not have that. There was no character development. Next, the quality of the performers was not what I have come to expect. None of it was jaw-dropping. None of it left me amazed or in wonderment, like Cirque performances historically. There was no mention during the performance wjere i caught myself with my mouth hanging open. It was like watching syncronuzed swimmers. Its as if the producers put all their eggs into the production value basket, and left the important parts out.

The night before, we saw Absinthe at Caesars Palace. It did not have a fraction of the production value. But it was memorable. Ill always remember it while O has already been forgotten. Production value means littlr without character development. And a circus should throw me back on my heels. This left me yawning."
O,"Superb! I saw this show when it opened a million years ago. It is still fantastic! A few things have changed but the excitement and talent has not changed at all. These performers are so talented.  Its hard to wrap your mind around how strong and athletic they really are. We have seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas and our favorite is LOVE, but O is a very close second.  Tickets are not cheap. Even the cheapest seats are expensive but its worth it to see these spectacular performers in this awesome show!"
O,This is truly an amazing show but bear in mind if you get front row seats especially in the middle like me and my wife you will get a little wet from the water I didnt mind but my wife was like ohhhh no I am getting wet.  The show is engaging with the viewer especially in the beginning of the show.  Really amazing to watch me and my wife truly enjoyed the show.
O,"I know I might be crucified for this, but I really do not see why so many people give this show a 5 star review. Yes it has some nice acrobats, and yes the music is great, but the reality is, to me, to stands very short of other Cirque shows and some of the few non Cirque shows on the strip. 
 
First off this is one of the most expensive shows and it always seems to sell out, or almost at least. So youd expect it to be the best of them all. So there is a man on fire. So there are two clowns who take up twenty minutes of the show (in between sets, I assuming so the actors and change). And honestly that is all that I can think of that was amusing. Perhaps I have seen too many of these shows and expect too much.

For a water show they really only used the pool as a set, to make ascetically pleasing, but other than that they fell very short on  the action and usage of the water. The whole show, to me, was full of dancing and a few actions that were cool, but mostly just the standard show of strength and what not. The boat scene, however, was the best part of the show, hands down, and if they had incorporated that throughout the show, then I would be able to see the hype. 

But I dont, and so I will say that the Other water show on the strip is much better."
O,"One of the best shows Ive seen in Vegas, had to see it again five years later and it was just entertaining as the first.  I love the acrobatics and the clowns in the acts are perfect and hilarious.  If you sit in the front section, make sure you bring a rain coat as they will try to get you wet."
O,"This is easily the best theatrical performance Ive ever seen. The acrobatics were incredible- I was wondering how the three girls in the red costumes had backbones- and the pool as the stage made everything that much more unique. While it does not have a plot or story line, I was certainly not bored at all with this show. The next scene continued to be better than the last. Im not sure if the price we paid for the tickets was worth it, but Im glad we did. I will also mention the theater staff at the Bellagio were fantastic. Please see this show if you have time, you wont regret it!"
O,"Saw O with my girlfriend after eating at the Bellagio Buffet, so I was in a bit of a food coma.  This was my second Cirque show, and while I liked it a lot, I liked my first one better (Zarkana).  The stunts are great, and the choreography and stage designs are beautiful.  The problem is that there was a lack of coherent story to follow.

I felt that Zarkana has a couple of things outside of the stunts and gymnastics that added variety, whereas some of the acts during O felt repetative.  The water definitely adds to the excitement in O.

Comparisons aside, had I not seen Zarkana, I would have thought this was amazing.  From what I understand, its not unusual at all to think that your first Crique show is the best, so I guess its not all that crazy.  I saw Zarkana at Radio City in NY, so while I am assuming its the same show as the one at Aria, I also need to point out that I have not seen any other of the Cirque Vegas shows, so I am in no position to tell you if this is better than Ka or Mystique(?) or Love.  

You cannot go wrong with seeing O though.  You will enjoy it if you like Cirque du Soleil, and if youve never been to one, this is a great first experience.  As I said, I would probably push Zarkana over O, but seeing O is still money well spent."
O,"The only Cirque show I had seen before was KA, and that was really good. The O show was very impressive as well. The different is that (besides O is water themed) is that O doesnt try to tell a story with the performances, and the stunts while impressive and expertly choreographed, I just think KA was slightly better.

O stage is really impressive, many moving parts to the pool platform, and lots of crazy dives and acrobatics. Highly recommended, too. Limited view seating starts at 120$ and are actually pretty good seats. I dont think there was really any bad seats. Even limited view seating which starts at $120 is worth it.

Tix4Tonight usually wont have O, so you need to go to the Bellagio directly."
O,"I purchased tix to this show while staying at the Bellagio. It was my anniversary and I wanted to do something nice for my wife.

I figured I might be bored but I would suck it up for her. I didnt think we would both dislike it.

First of all, it is grossly overpriced. I paid hundreds of dollars for each ticket. Let that sink in for a moment. For 2 tickets I could have made a mortgage payment. Thats absurd. I understand the show is expensive to produce, but I expected more for the amount I paid.

Basically it is a bunch of circus acts that perform around a pool. 

There is no story, few moments of wit or delight, and nothing to actually grab the viewer.

There are elaborate costumes, but costumes do not a show make.

My wife and I fell asleep during it. I wasnt trying to be rude. It just happened. I was embarrassed by it when I woke up and realized Id passed out. But then I looked around and saw I was not the only one in my section. Seems like quite a few of us ponied up for a very expensive nap that night.

No substance. At all. Go to ABSINTHE. It is much better than CIRQUE. And it has no pretension."
O,"Its a worthwhile Cirque show to see when in Vegas. Lots of cool acrobatics going in and out of the water. The theater is quite small so you can clearly see the main stage from just about everywhere. The clowns on this show are very funny. 
Be prepared to walk through the entire casino to get to the ticket counter, the show gets full too."
O,"oh my goodness gracious. can we ask everyone to describe the word magical? thats what this show brought out. the music &amp; act was so ethereal and emotional with pretty much NO words spoken at any time. something i love about cirque du soleil is that because majority of their shows are acrobatic and visual, it leaves a lot to your imagination to interpret what you see. 

throughout this show enchanting music in sung, amazing tricks are done beyond skillfully &amp; gracefully. the makeup, the hair, the costumes, the attention to detail in everything theater really blows your mind away. 

so besides all the amazing skill that is so worth seeing... let your mind wander... what is the clown thinking? is that guy really on fire? is this a story about love? adventure? fear? magic? a dream? or just a whole other reality all together? you gotta tell the story in your own head &amp; get back to me... im still trying to decide if im set on the story Ive told in my head.

a must see masterpiece that you wont regret experiencing!"
O,"4 stars because its Cirque. Long but clever transitions between acts. Its my fourth show and the fourth best Ive seen. Kooza, mystere, and allegria are better. The clowns were the highlight of this show. It gets warm, so dress in layers!"
O,"This is my third Cirque du Soleil show - Ive watched Totem and Ka. While this was definitely the most whimsical and beautiful set (the stage was basically a huge pool) I felt that Ka was much better - in terms of storyline (O had zero storyline) and aerobatics stunts. O I felt was like watching one big synchronised swimming performance. Lovely but whats new? However, I did like the way the stage changes fluidly between sets. Some sets had dry land and some were all water... others was a mixture. The characters also has beautiful costumes and popped in and out of the water with such grace. The breathtaking high dives had us at the edge of our seats.

I think a storyline would have helped tie the performance together better and made it easier for the audience to follow without dozing off as one Yelper put it. 

Tips for snacks: Dont get the mango freeze. Its way too sweet! Feels like drinking a pound of sugar. Pop-corn on the other hand was way too salty, almost as if they felt like they had to match the mango freezes extreme levels of sugar just to be consistent."
O,"My favorite Cirque show in Las Vegas hands down! Yeah they have the priciest tickets but oh my goodness the whole experience is worth it! The stage, live music and performers are just absolutely amazing! Dont sit too close to the front rows of the stage because there is a lot happening above and to the sides of the stage. Family friendly show that will be enjoyed by all ages. The acrobatics the performers do are just jaw dropping. 

I dont understand the people who come in late! For O, dont come late, the beginning of the show has the coolest stage effect I have ever seen in my life. Dont miss it, seriously!"
O,The best Cirque du Soleil show and Ive seen 5 now. The tickets for this show are a lot more expensive than the others but its an experience you will not forget.
O,"This is my favorite Cirque show in Las Vegas.  I saw it twice with two very special people in my life.  The first time I saw this was almost 4 years ago with my best friend.  I remember being in awe the entire show.  The moment it ended I had already wanted to see it again.

Fast forward to this past weekend.  I am once again seated in the O audience totally captivated by each act.  This time I am with my boyfriend.  Still, my favorite part is the opening scene where the large red drape opens up to reveal the stage made up of water.  It takes my breath away EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  It almost hypnotizes me.  

The dancers/swimmers are as strong as I can remember.  I still love it."
O,Never....in my life....have I experienced such a breathtaking show.  It is beyond amazing.....honestly...you cannot skip this show if you go to Vegas.  Ive been to Vegas 2-3 times a year for the last 8 years or so and have never been.  I think due to the $180 price tag attached.  I finally said screw it and decided to pay the money....and I kick myself for not paying sooner.  Simply.....amazing.  Nuff said.
O,Totally worth watching! You will definitely go home with a huge smile! World class show!
O,"Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!

but it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldnt pay to watch it again though."
O,"This is my third favorite Cirque show (in Vegas). Ive seen it a total of 4 times, which is more than any other Cirque show. Its solely a water stage, though at different times, therell be an actual stage without the water, but that doesnt last very long. I love the concept of water so this was a must-see for me originally. However, it is kind of overhyped so my two friends werent too impressed with it afterward. Either way, its the best selling Cirque show in Vegas still.

The theater isnt too big and Ive sat on the 1st &amp; 2nd levels, but I would like to try the balcony seating one day (hopefully). There is also a section between the 2nd level and the balcony thats called the loggia but youre kind of facing it at an angle because of the seats themselves. Thats what Ive heard but Ive never seen it close enough to tell so *shrugs*.

Most seats are good but there are what Cirque considers limited view seating and its considered limited view because of the railing that would be in your view during the entire show. However, youll still be able to enjoy the show for the most part, depending which limited view seating you have. I had a limited view seating, but it hardly bothered me.

Theres not a story (as far as I know) and so each scene is pretty random, I guess. There is a preshow so you dont want to be late! Be early! Our favorite 2 clowns will be the preshow and those 2 are pretty awesome. 

Enjoy the show, dont be tired nor too drunk (or youll probably fall asleep), and clap hard for the artists!"
O,My boyfriend and I came to watch for the very first time ever. We had such a good time. The acts were so perfectly timed and sooo breathtaking. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. It was worth the bucks ...
O,"This is by far on my list of top 3 favorite Cirque shows. The water is mesmerizing, and all of the performers do amazing jobs! The theater is located in the back area of the beautiful Bellagio Hotel &amp; Casino. I guess not the back-back....the upper corner? Its a little bit of a walk from the front lobby, but pretty easy to find. The price is a little steep for a ticket, but take my word for it - its worth it! Heres my tip of the day: skip the higher priced orchestra level seats, where your view might be obstructed anyway by a taller person, and get seats in the loggia. No one in front of you, and you get a unique view of the theater. Be sure to take note of the ceiling, its gorgeous!"
O,This was an amazing show and worth every penny.  I was impressed by how they popped in and out of the water.  Things appeared and disappeared off the stage.
O,"I almost cried when I shelled out for tickets for Julia D and myself to see O at the Bellagio over Christmas but $260 for two upper tier seats turned out to be money well spent and one of the highlights of the trip to Vegas. 

The theatre is pretty good and even though our tickets said they were restricted views it didnt really spoil my enjoyment of the show. O is a water based show with the stage constantly evolving and adapting with the protagonists swimming, diving or appearing to walk on water at various times. O was my first Cirque du Soleil experience and I was very impressed with the whole set up. In Las Vegas there are so many shows to see but if you are willing to part with the cash I would recommend seeing this one."
O,"Ive seen several cirque du soleil shows and this is one of my favorites. The clowns, which usually annoy me, were really entertaining and the music was phenomenal. The only thing I did not like was the African American gentleman wearing the thong and red corset. He appears to be talented, but he was distracting and his costume did not mesh well with the theme of the show. I felt they could have utilized his talent more appropriately. Overall, a great show worth seeing twice."
O,Awesome show. My favorite I have been to. Five of them. First time they took my phone. No pictures. No mercy. I begged to get my phone back. I even offered to delete the pictures there. I totally understand but my kids were with a sitter and I was denied. 400$ of tickets. No warning. Maybe in the pre show but I missed that.  So here is ur warning. They will take no matter  what
O,"I feel like I shouldnt have read any reviews or have had high expectations because I felt like there wasnt anything that blew my mind away. Dont get me wrong, the show was good, just wasnt as good as everyone makes it out to be, in my opinion. 

The price of tickets were kind of high, but we sat in section 201? The obstructed view seats because of a railing blocking the view so tickets were cheaper. Honestly I think these seats are a good deal, youre sitting right next to people who paid $170+ and your view isnt obstructed like at all. You can still see everything fine, just a thin hand rail slightly at eye level. 

When the show first started I thought it was a bit weird and didnt really get what was going on. Then the acrobatics woke me up. Some of the dives had me nervous and the strength and talent of the performers is just amazing! 

Two of the fire performers dropped their stick and rope thing, I think one of them burned themselves so hoped he was okay. I thought the fire part was one of the best parts of the show. 

Overall I thought O was just ok. Good but not mind blowing. Dont go in with high expectations from all the reviews. To me, maybe because Im not much of an artistic person, I felt like the show was more about art than a story or acrobatics. I went in expecting more acrobatics and stunts, but if you can enjoy the artistic value of it Im sure youll love it!"
O,"6 years ago I saw this production on a family vacation to Vegas (yes there are some family things that can be done). We didnt have the best seats, however, what we did have allowed us to share in the experience of the show. This has no real story line which makes it accessible for everyone to just enjoy the art without having to think about the plot too much. After all it is Vegas where no one really thinks about the plot to things. I loved the lady dressed in black and white that looked like a clock."
O,"Seen one youve seen them all. This was a bit boring because its the same thing for an hour which,  bore me to death and its one of the more expensive shows. Dont waste your money seeing this"
O,"I wish that I could give this show a higher rating but after sitting in the upper mezzanine all I could see for about 30% of the show was the big bright backlighting that made it hard to see the act. I was thoroughly disappointed by that. It seemed to me that it was unnecessary to have that light on at all! 

Over all it was a pretty great show and I did enjoy the clowns a lot. But for FUCKSAKE TURN OFF THAT BRIGHT ASS LIGHT! 

If youre going to see this show spend the extra money to get the closer seats off of the mezzanine. 

k thx bye."
O,"What an amazing water show!!! Just incredible!!! I never saw them change the shape of the stage!! It was so well done that the time passed unnoticed, because we were so entertained. Totally worth what we spent on it. I am so very impressed with these cirque performers. I would totally recommend this show.  It was my husbands first cirque show and he enjoyed it so much he cant wait to see another!"
O,"This is certainly not my first Cirque du Soleil show. I have been to a number of them in the past and they are my absolute favorite! O is no exception. Loved it, loved it! The performances are so good that they keep you at the edge of your seat during the entire show. The costumes are excellent, the lighting and the music, just so perfectly synchronized. They also have a cute gift shop just outside the theatre.

Highly recommend when you are in the Sin City."
O,Dont waste your money.  Performers mediocre at best. Music was good.  Contortions were good but only lasted 5 minutes.  Seats were very small like a airplane with out your own armrest.  Big disappointment.  Go see mystere very entertaining.
O,"O was the second Cirque show I have ever seen and it has always stayed with me as one of my favorites. It is an innovative and beautiful show. I have been twice over the years and unlike every other show, this is the only one I have actually had to pay full price for each and every time. That says a lot about the demand for this spectacular show. 

I recommend spending a little more to get tickets closer towards the front. It is a very large theater and although every seat is good, being closer is definitely better."
O,"This show was terrible, I have absolutely know idea what I just watched... There was no plot, no names of the characters introduced, nothing but acrobats and music in another language. 

To top it off, security screamed at my fiancé for looking at her phone. This was a boring, rip off, not customer friendly show!

Save your money here and go and see Le Reve The Dream, it puts this show to shame. I would give this show 1/2 a star if I could."
O,"Was so excited to see this show,  first show we booked as soon as we decided to go to Vegas!! Had such great reviews.  Was pretty disappointed and didnt think any of it was amazing.  Maybe all the hype had me overexcited, but honestly couldnt wait for it to be over and I could move on with my night!  

Again some of it was all right and kind of cool, but was expecting so much more."
O,"Over hyped, over rated and over price. No story and I dont feel any connection with the show. The acrobatics are unique with the water and diving performances. Good costumes and make up. The color is good and dreamy. Visually stunning. Great effect. The huge turn off is NO storyline, confusing characters. Ka is much much better, it has great storyline, memorable and much better music than O. Better watch Ka couple times than O. Personally it deserves 3 stars rating. However to balance the over hyped review, 1 star rating is given."
O,"The BEST Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas. Other aqua shows in Vegas cant compare (I dont think I need to mention names here).  I saw this show in 2009 and I cant wait to see it again.

The music was great as well."
O,This is my all time favorite Cirque show. I am just amazed by how they use the water stage. O and La Reve are both pretty mesmerizing in this regard. I have seen O three times and it still blows me away every time.
O,"This is an awesome show. We sat in the 3rd row orchestra level. These seats were great. We did get a little wet, but it didnt matter. Without giving away the show, it is worth every penny."
O,"Beautiful show! My husband and I sat front and center on the balcony and I felt like I was able to visually consume every bit of the performance. The dancing, acrobatics, colors, design, music, costume, EVERYTHING was beyond phenomenal. Even the short comedy skits were great. I continue to rave about the show and encourage my family and friends to go see it. 

Would absolutely do it again!"
O,"Amazing show! My husband and I went for our date night on our vacation, away from the group. The stage was incredible how it one minute was a deep pool, then suddenly it was the stage. Performers did great and the clowns are too funny!!!!! 

They take pictures when you walk in so after the show you can get a great souvenir of you and your loved ones. $75 - a little pricey but I thought the moment was worth it.

Snacks and adult beverages available which was nice!"
O,"This was by far the best cirque show Ive seen. The whole show transports you to another world. Its a little eerie and some of the acting is predictable but they have really amazing feats! I was holding my breath half the time. 

The stage and all the props were so intricate. It consisted of so many moving parts. At times, people just came underwater seemingly from nowhere. At every scene there was always a ton to look at. Not just the acrobats but side performers as well. Never a dull moment!

We sat in the fifth row and seriously, these were great seats! Completely worth seeing up close."
O,"How can you give this show less than 5 stars?  Perhaps Im just easily amused, but I loved everything about the show from the way they opened the curtain, to the way they closed the curtain.  The price of the tickets compared to other shows, combined with the fact that it seems to be sold out quite often, suggests Im not the only one who loves the show.  I hear that some people dont like chocolate though, so I guess everyone has different tastes.

My wife and I had seats that were in the front row in the very corner, so we missed a bit of the show before they opened the curtain because our view was blocked.  I was a bit annoyed at first, but quickly became involved in the rest of the show and the 2 minutes I couldnt see didnt really amount to much.  

I think the location of our seats in the first row really emphasized how high the aerial performers were and possibly made the stage seem that much more impressive.

I found every bit of the show to be world class as another reviewer said, and since learning that the music was performed live, I am once again blown away as their performance was flawless to my ears.  Because of our location in the theater we could not see the musicians.

Even after spending several hours on planes earlier in the day, and waking up at midnight Las Vegas time that day (meaning we had been awake for approximately 19 and a half hours when the show started) we were not lulled to sleep as other reviewers were.

The tickets may be pricey for some, and the $108 we paid for each ticket is not small change to me.  It was worth every penny.  In a town where you can spend hundreds on dinner or a couple of hours gaming, it seems like a downright good valu.  So, eat at McDonalds, stay away from the slots for an hour, do whatever you have to do to see O.  It will be much more memorable than the steak you skipped to see it."
O,"Its difficult to give only 3 stars to Cirque but I have to. Ive been in two more Cirques out of Vegas and this was, in comparison, disappointing. I was aware and agreed with the no storyline but the acrobatic performances were mediocre and the comic part wasnt funny for me. Yes, the pond and the water performances were innovative and amazing, but that excitement lasted 10 minutes. I really got bored. I still remember some performances from previous Cirques. I dont think the same is going to happen this time."
O,This show is fantastic if you havent seen Le Reve at the Wynn. In comparison it doesnt even come close... If we had seen this first I probably would have given it a better review but Le Reve was like The O on steroids.
O,"I was visiting Vegas with my Dad and sister and brother.  For my Dad and sister, it was their first time in Vegas and my brother and I wanted to take them to a Vegas show.

I had booked suites at the Bellagio and thought that logistically it would be best if we saw something there.  Cirque du Soleil O was an easy choice.  Ive seen Cirques Ka and Zumanity before so I knew they would enjoy it.

The venue is quite large.  We got mid-range seats since I wasnt quite sure they wanted to see it.  (It was more my idea then theirs)  The venue is quite large and from what I understand some of the less expensive seats have obstructed views.  The show is has a water theme so the the front few rows are in a splash zone.

The show is very good.  As always the acrobatics are amazing and the stage transforms from a dry surface to a large pool several time throughout the show.  The show is about 2 hours.  I got the tickets online.  Be prepared to wait in a bit of line to pick up your tickets a will call so plan ahead.

All in all, a great show to see in Vegas although Id probably recommend seeing it on your first night because I dont care how good the show is,  the 24 hour party in Vegas and lack of sleep will probably have you falling asleep as soon as the lights go down.

Stay sexy fellow Yelpers!"
O,FAN FKN TASTIC!  never seen anything like this ever!  Almost as good as the shen yen acrobats!  Well worth the cost of the tickets just to see the aerials and high wire artists perform their lovely choreographed acts.   I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
O,"PROS: The costumes, the characters, the lights, the acrobatics, the huge 1 million gallon pool, the enticement!! OMG this show is a MUST SEE! Im seriously in love. I was completely absorbed in every moment of the 1 hour 40 minute show!!

My boyfriend bought us tickets to celebrate my birthday here, and I have been and still am extremely happy from the experience. 

The 1800 seat gorgeous theater was completely filled! Our seats were almost as perfect as I could have wanted. It wasnt up too close where youd have to look up, hurt your neck, and get your nice cocktail dress or suit drizzled by the water. And it wasnt up too high where you cant see squash. Our seat number was Section 102 Row N, which is in the middle of the auditorium. Seriously, spend the slight extra money for good seats because youll probably enjoy it so much that youd want to go back. (Then... you might as well get the cheaper ones).

As for the show, I wont elaborate too much because there are so many reviews and synopses online about the story. Some people I talked to didnt seem to catch the story, and others did. But overall, it was magnificent.

Just to announce it again: Highly, highly recommended!!! I was so in love with the show that I bought the O cushion frame/folder with our pictures inside for $40.

Also, to sum it up... Few hours after the show, we stayed at Bellagio to play for a bit, and we ended up playing craps with Guy Laliberté... Umm WOW? (pictures posted for your entertainment)


CONS: None!

:)"
O,"MEHHHHH! I would have given this 3 stars probably, but seeing as I paid $238 for 2 LIMITED VIEW seats, heres 2 little stinking stars, you assholes.

CONS:
-SLOWWWW - I was literally falling asleep in the beginning. The soft music was lulling me to bed, and it was hard to really see what the synchronized swimmers were doing. 
- Stupid clown act. Literally every time the clowns came out, a little piece inside of me started fuming for having dished out the cash for this show. I paid for breath-taking choreography and death-defying stunts, not a clown/mime act that my neighbors little kids could have performed. I guess these two clowns were supposed to be funny and charming and serve as a break for the real performers to rest, but all they did was piss me off.
- Absolutely nonsensical story-line. Did the plot just progress? IS there a plot? Shit, are the damn clowns coming back?

PROS:
- Show ended better than it started, as the music picked up and the focus shifted from boring synchronized swimming to trapeze and fire-dancers and contortionist acts.
- Music was live and it was fun to see the guys in the studio windows jamming on keyboards and stuff. 
- Special water stage set-up was cool 

After reading all these rave yelp reviews, the show was pretty disappointing. O didnt even come CLOSE to the Cirque LOVE show, so go see that one instead!!! Its faster-paced, has better stunts and music, the stage arena is positioned better so that ALL seats are good, and its more affordable!"
O,Quite simply the best Cirque Du Soleil show and a must see if you like their shows. The set is absolutely amazing as is the performance!
O,"Its a great show if you are into the Circue de Soleil,  however, you need to like acrobatics. Comparing to other shows that are more upbeat / fun, this one is on the slightly slower side. Also, comparing to similar concept of La Reve,  I like the last one much much more. Still, its a great experience"
O,"The show is just so cool.  From the first moment the curtain is pulled back you are in awe.  The costumes, the sets, the pool...its all pretty incredible.  I swear you nenver saw anyone actually getting out of the pool.  The one thing I will say is that the story lines are always a little bit strange in Cirque shows but they are really entertaining nonetheless."
O,"This is my 2nd favorite show in Las Vegas. I love the  pool, and the acrobatics were really nice. I splurged and bought front row seats, and boy was it worth it. My favorite part was the diving with all the twists and flips. Its a great show. The performers are very strong and talented."
O,"Breathtaking! This was our first Cirque show and it definitely wont be the last. I wasnt sure what to expect, but knew I wanted to go to Cirque show while in town. Amazing show, with too much to see. I am looking forward to going again to soak in everything I may have missed the first time around. 

Dazzled by the artists and their ability to move so gracefully whether high above the ground or throughout the water. We did not have any issues with people being ushered in late as with some other posters. We sat in the lower section, row k, just left of the stage. I do not believe there is a bad seat in the house."
O,"DAMN. this show is GREAT.
yes, the tickets are expensive, but well worth the price.
everything is spectacular about the show. i think every seat in the theater is a good seat.
acrobatics and stunning visuals complete this show."
O,"Wow how I love Cirque du Soleil-O! 

I have never seen a Cirque show before, O was my first one and wow I was so amazed on how beautiful this show is! I think I was on the edge of my seat the entire time my girls and I were there! The acrobats, music, lights and colors will make you forget where you are. 

It is a lot of money-but if you are in Vegas for a special occasion, you minus well treat yourself on something you deserve- a great show! I want to see the others KA, The Beatles and MJ show those are next on the bucket list."
O,"Sometimes hype can be a bad thing.  Cirque du Soleils O is truly a technical marvel.  I was flabbergasted by the fact that there is an aquatic acrobatic performance for the stage.  Sprightly little divers from China somersaulting through the air and the plunging into a pool that seemed almost bottomless.  But this novelty lasted about 20 min, then it became a bit tiresome.  There are only so many variations that can be done of people twirling and diving into the water to a background of haunting music.  The best way to sum it up is to compare it to my love of pizza.  It is one of my favorite foods, but I cant eat a thousand slices of it.  At some point I have to say stop so that I can keep it my special food.  

But, I cant deny that it is a very unique show and I think that it is worth watching once.  My seats were in the mezzanine level.  The good thing was that it provided an awesome vantage to see how the stage changes and transition from hard floor to water were made.  The bad thing was that there is a severe bright light at the back of the stage that is aimed right at the mezzanine.  On occasion, I felt like I was staring into the sun.  If you want to see something different, O might be a good choice.  But if  you really want bang for your buck entertainment, you may want to try a different show."
O,"Acrobatics, water ballet, comedy, and magic.....
I suppose these are the keywords/tags I would use when describing this performance.
Every single second I was in awe.
I tried to document every fascinating snippet as I experienced the magical moment this group of talented performers brought.
Not only are they extremely talented in what they are able to do with their bodies, they also show a heck of a lot of trust. Performing 10 times a week and going through a years training before performance shows determination and passion for what they do. I am very impressed.
I found the clowns adorable with their acts and some of their stunts like mini magic tricks, the water ballet simply fierce yet graceful, the acrobatics and flame jugglers fabulous and precise...
Standing ovation. Best show in Vegas and with the full audience to show."
O,"The costumes were gorgeous.  The cast was superb.  So why was I bored?  For all the time and effort Cirque puts into choreography its wasted without a story.  

I had no idea what was going on and wish they would hire some writers to develop a plot.

To much time was wasted on the clowns.  This isnt Barnum Bailey and in the middle of the show I found them on a boat.  Why?"
O,"Still in awe! Las Vegas, more than anything to me, means theater, and this performance was the very best of the best. The talent, creativity, choreography, staging, music, costumes - everything was outstanding! Save what money you had planned to spend in the casino (or just spend your winnings, you lucky duck) and buy a ticket!"
O,"An amazing out of this world show...
Process to get it..out..ticketing. .all of it..

Must see....best seats..row 3 to 10..worth rhe money..do not you dare try to save 20 or 30 dollars you cheap bas...ds...this is not where you save money on vegas..skip a meal and take the ticket..
The meal..eventually goes down the toilet.
The memory..for ever..

Why four stars...well..no one is perfect"
O,Wonderfully creative..like a fantasy.  Great performers.  Very entertaining.  Tip:  if you are local..tell them for a better price and we bought our tickets an hr before and got great seats at a great price.
O,"Cirque Du Soleil shows are always amazing, and this one is no different. 

My boyfriends mom had given us rave reviews of O and we had heard many great things about this show online, so we purchased tickets to the 10pm show of O.

This show is visually stunning. The combination of water, lights, song and performers was amazing. I was stunned how they show incorporated the moving floor into the deep water. 

I liked the performers of this show -- there were divers, swimmers, dancers, and stunt performers who put me to shame physically wise. I just wish they had more acrobat performances in this show since that is what I go to to see a Cirque show to see. Also, there was so much going on in this show at once that sometimes I got side tracked watching the side performers instead of the main act. That was kind of a bummer. 

Id recommend this show if you are looking for a different type of Cirque show, but if you are looking for more of an acrobat type show, this one isnt for you!!

Cheers!"
O,"O is for Overrated. Yes, I said it... but its still a very, very, very good show.  Im going to be extra critical of this show in this review because it gets so much praise.

I wanted to start with my best tip for the show (since its Cirque du Soleils most popular and consequently most expensive show - rarely there are discounts in off season) - the restricted view seats in section 203, row P. There is a brass handrail at the very bottom of your field of vision, but it doesnt take away much from the view of the show. Tickets are around $109 instead of the $180 that your seat neighbours are paying. You need to buy the tickets by calling the box office, they are not available online.

So why overrated? O is widely known as CdS best show, so I went in expecting perfection. And perfect it almost was - so perfect it was a bit boring. The circus acts were very unique with the water element, visually beautiful and elegant, and flowed together seamlessly, but there was not as big as an excitement factor overall. Actually - if you google comparisons of La Reve (the other water show in Vegas, from former CdS people) vs O, many say they enjoy La Reve better for that reason. I havent seen La Reve personally (hopefully next time I go to Vegas), but I can see where they are coming from. O is beautiful but boring.  Still a lovely, lovely show for Cirque fans, though. 

When I saw it, another thing that bothered me is that in one of the climaxes of the show - the swinging boat - the performers missed the last catch (which in itself didnt matter to me because it is hard to do!), but there was no room to retry this trick, so it was a bit of an anticlimactic ending to the act. I understand that trying it again would disrupt the flow of the show, but it was kind of a letdown that they didnt.

Criticisms aside, it really is a beautiful, aesthetically stunning show that is one of Cirque du Soleils best.  I wouldnt necessarily recommend it for a fun night out (go see Love or MJ: one), but definitely a must see for hardcore cirque fans and those wanting something more elegant and classy."
O,"I want to write the treatments for the events that transpire during a Cirque du Soleil show. Apparently, their staff is at liberty to suggest stunts that require obscene levels of fantasy, whimsy, mortality-testing, and glitter, all of which my little girl heart holds near and dear.

The script for O is pretty close to something I wrote up years ago actually, when I was 12. In fact, I might check on copyright infringement. Here is a checklist of items O borrowed from my childhood brainstorming.

1. All performers will have mutant powers - Check
2. At some point, there is going to be fire blasting all over the stage - Check
3. Also there will be tons of water, and people will be making death-defying leaps, spins, and twists in the air before diving at least 40 feet into a below-stage pool - Check
4. Super-humans will be twirling over the stage, the audience, and the graves of their ancestors - Check
5. The audience will be made to feel lazy and completely ordinary - Check
6. The costumes are to be made while the tailors are on a combination of hallucinogens - Check
7. There must be massive explosions and lightning! - Check
8. There shouldnt really be a story, just all the genius stuff I already wrote - Check

You should see O to identify your own kidnapped ideas from days of yore. You probably thought they were foolish, but now Cirque du Soleil is dreaming up crap all the way to the bank. Well get in on a joint lawsuit."
O,"Why people give five starts to this? I dont get, seriously. The whole show is just a mess: boring music, costumes, not that impressive acrobatics. And the storyline... Wait... Was there any? Not worth of watching at all. Save your money."
O,"This is now the second Cirque show I have attended and been absolutely bored. When you think typical Cirque you think crazy acrobatics, awesome music, a story, humor, etc, basically something for everyone. However, this show is very similar to KA that I had seen earlier. It is one of the most expensive show tickets on the strip, and when you leave you feel like you pretty much paid for the location, the mechanics of the show, and thats about it. The music was bland, the acrobatics were almost non existent. I guess they were really hoping we would be so impressed by the water they didnt need to put much into the actual production. If you want to see a water show, pay a couple bucks more and go to Le Reve at the Wynn. They actually did it right, or go see Mystere... Save your money, its not worth it."
O,"An amazing production. From ticketing to seating to close, everything was executed in great style. The staff is very efficient and knowledgeable of seating arrangements, timing, crew even. They kept photography stealers to a minimum by discreetly scanning them out. But lets be honest, who hasnt tried once to photograph this beautiful show? The dancers, acrobats, all performers are beyond talented. Their moves are perfectly timed and I really was sucked into the magical world of O. The only bad thing (only for me) was the cold theatre, but I am part amphibian, Im always cold. Im sure the temperature is controlled for the safety of the performers, so suck it up and bring a sweater. I  would recommend the mid to upper seats (the ones they recommend) which are higher in price, but theres a reason for it, as the production uses the entirety of the stage so you want a full view, top to bottom. I have now seen all Cirque Du Soleil shows except the Beatles show, and this is by far my favorite."
O,"Cirque du Soleil - O  is actually the first show Ive seen in Las Vegas. So its hard for me to do the rating because I have nothing to compare it to. So for now, I will give 5 stars until I found something better, I will go back and change my rating. ;-) 

Ive been hearing about O from many people, so I went into the show with a lot of expectation. Plus, we paid for $180 per person. We were on sixth row to the left of the stage which was very close to the stage. 

I gotta say the production is truly world-class. All the music was LIVE. The stage was amazing. I cant figure how all the flat-forms moved around. I dont want to spill a lot of information here to ruin the show. But I was very impressed with the stage. The performers were incredible. There was a few times that I felt like I had a heart-attack. 

It is very pricey for 1.5 hour show.. but you are in Vegas.. and this is really, again, truly world-class production with absolutely no mistakes."
O,"Took my from-out-of-town friend here for some Vegas shock and awe.  And we were quite in the shock and the awe.  

I knew we were in for a special treat when we walked into the theater and I could smell the water from behind the curtain.  The stage and theater are specially designed for little surprises and various random things that happen throughout the show (e.g the scuba divers, random dancers in the corners).

Tip: If you can, go to the 10pm showing.  Tickets are usually 20% cheaper than the 730pm show.  Also avoid the first three rows, which is the splash zone.  Aint nobody got time for that!

The only thing I didnt really like about the show was the clown segments.  Although cute and funny, they were quite lengthy."
O,"OOOO-mazing! Yes, it is OOO-mazing! 
The tickets were $150 or $180 for what I paid and the seats were GREAT. Go to see amazing views and I love every moment of it. 
I have seen many Cirque du Soleil shows and this is far the best show there is in the strip!"
O,"So im the only person who hated this show?

Hear me out...

I have seen MANY Cirque shows. Therein lay the main problem.

After seeing all of them I was able to see most of their previous shows mashed into this one... with the addition of a swimming pool. Which is used for some of the show, but not all.

This is touted as a water show... correct?

Too bad the pool is covered a majority of the time.

Theres no central theme. Im not 90 years old, so synchronized swimming doesnt work me into a tizzy. Its a circus, yes, but whats with the EXCESS amount of clown interludes... yes -- clowns, clowns and more clowns. Usually at cirque shows you deal with them as the stage is altered. WRONG.

They should call 0 the clown show with some short water acts and all the other acrobatics and gymnasts youve seen in every other cirque show.

Skip this and see a Cirque show when it comes close to you."
O,This show is the most amazing show I have ever seen.  It is so cool.  It is totally worth the price of the tickets.  You do not need to sit up front.  We sat in the back and still loved the show.  I have been to 3 Cirque du Soleil show and this show was the best one.  I have seen magicians and the blue man group but this show was the best.  I could not believe the acrobatics and the big pool used in the show.  It is so amazing.
O,Pink Floyd meets Salvador Dahli but excellent performance just no context. Worth $300 ? Not sure but left with a smile
O,"A very entertaining show.  Pretty pricey compared to a few other shows available.  I was surprised that the show lasted 90 minutes, you really get your moneys worth.  Some incredible acts."
O,Awesome performance! This was very much a theatrical show. It combined the best of both worlds that only Cirque can do! I love that they involved the audience in the performance. I couldnt keep up with the story...maybe because Ive never seen Avatar...maybe because I forgot my glasses. A must see for the entire family. Kids will love this!!
O,One of the best live performances in Vegas Ive seen. The acrobatics in the show made it hard to blink. We set up pretty high but were still able to see everything clearly. I highly recommend!
O,"When I went to Vegas last year, I booked through Southwest Airlines (the Air Taxi as I call it) which had a package that included a ticket to one of the Cirque de Soleil shows in Vegas. Since I had never seen a Cirque show in person I checked up on Yelp (naturally) and found that everyone raved about O, so I chose this one. I was expecting to be falling asleep because with all the dimmed lights, but was I dead wrong

This show is in the Bellagio hotel (amazing hotel by the way). No matter where you sit, the way everything is angled you will not miss the action ...I even got to see the scuba divers at the bottom of the tank. The clowns that come out before the show to keep everyone entertained were hilarious

I had never watched a Cirque show (only seen quick clips), but it is something you need to experience in person because the way the choreography and acrobatics are performed are just jaw dropping. The music that accompanies is amazing too. This show just kept me alert and awake"
O,"Wow. This was amazing. A pool of water in the middle of the stage! High divers! Synchronized swimmers! Contorists! 

The only bad thing is that sometimes there would be too many things going on at once and you have no clue where to look.

Other than that, go!"
O,"I keep hearing things about this show so I made it a show stopper to come see what I hear is the best show in Vegas.  I had my hopes up really high and usually thats not a good sign.

The theater for O is pretty nice.  When the doors opened you walked through the doors and got led through a hallway of very beautiful sculptures of characters in O.  They came in many different sizes and I stopped to look and admire many of the pieces.  Once you walk past the artwork you are at the theater doors where ushers help point you to the right seat.  

The O theater is pretty nice and cozy.  We had center seating about 10-15 rows back.  We sat down for a few minutes when the show started with some of the case walking around and we thought were just goofing off with some crowd interaction to get the crowd into it.  This went on for about 10 minutes and there were some good laughs.  What we didnt know was that this was a lead into the show and an introduction to some of the characters. 

I dont really want to write an in depth review to spoil this show so Ill just say, if theres one show you want to see in Vegas its O!!!

Visually its beautiful, the music and vocals are gorgeous...and live.  There is a lot going on so dont sit to close or you can miss things.  I was taken through a roller coaster of emotions but the one that was there throughout was joy.  At times I was scared...youll know when you see it and when the show ended I wanted to cry because I didnt want it to stop.  

Did I mention I didnt sleep the night before and was running on an all nighter while watching the 10pm show?  It kept me awake and wanting more.  Id definitely see this show again!"
O,Amazing water performance. The multiple layers of stage and captivating characters had me enticed throughout the whole show!
O,"This was my second Vegas Cirque show, the first being Ka.

I think that the water added a very cool element (see what I did there?) to the show. However, I felt that there wasnt one solid storyline. It felt more like a greatest hits album. 

Pros: Live singers- VERY cool. The water- I wasnt sure what to expect, but the way the stage opened up to allow different parts to be completely pool like, or just a few feet was unlike anything Ive ever seen before.

Cons: Who brings their CHILDREN to a Cirque show in Vegas??? Also, the ushers didnt bring booster seats into the theatre until AFTER the show had started. For $100+, I expect nothing to hinder my ability to enjoy the show. An usher standing directly in front of me definitely does.

I cant wait to go back, and see another show."
O,"I had such great expectations for O but it fell so short. I expected a story line somewhere in the lines of magical. However, O has 7-8 acts thrown in at the same time without a constant to link them: synchronized swimmers, clowns, trapeze, a man with a whip...I felt like I was in a lighter version of American Horror Story at first and then it just died out into boring and monotone acts. The one act I did enjoy was the two contortionist girls. The most boring ones were the clowns... They were not funny at all. I didnt understand anything that went on during those 90 minutes and I would NOT recommend you to see this show. Please see Abstinthe instead, that my friend, is one amazing intimate performance!!"
O,"The  best  show I have ever seen from Cirque, Music, set, everything leaves you Breathless.
A memory sure to last a lifetime.
A show not to  miss, if I get the chance will see it again."
O,"Breathtaking, amazing performances, super talented cast, simply awesome! An amazing Valentines present :*)

My boyfriend and I sat 5 rows from the front and got to see every small detail that were put into the production. It was so magical to see an aquatic show brought to life. I still cant get over how amazing the set and production was. A breathtaking 1.5-2 hour show!

The only downfall was of course, the price. This show is probably one of, if not the most expensive in Vegas. The stage was huge but the theatre itself was pretty small, which means that you would probably still get the full experience purchasing the Level 3-4 tickets. Also, each row of seats drop pretty low so you are not blocked by the person in front of you. 

Would definitely love to see this again! 

A+!"
O,This is the Cirque show of shows.  Amazing feats of water acrobatics and the pool constructed for the show is equally amazing. My only criticism is that I hated the clowns and the show dragged on a little bit too long.
O,"We got front row seats (note that they are close to the scene and water can splash).

The performance was amazing and had a nice story to it. 

Wish it was longer ;-)"
O,"This is the best Cirque du Soleil show I have ever seen and I was so sad when it ended! Before I saw the show, I thought it would only be synchronized swimming but there was so much more that it blew my mind! It was like Olympic synchronized swimming and diving or Sea World with people instead of Shamu combined with a weird, creative, artistic, and imaginative dream. The show consisted of acrobatics, diving, synchronized swimming, and fire. Like all Cirque du Soleil shows, the live music was inspirational and the costumes and stage were beautiful. Everyone who performed in this show was so talented! I wish I could join Cirque du Soleil."
O,I went with my girlfriend to watch the O Show.  This is my 2nd time watching the show and her 1st time watching the show.  Just watching the show again was amazing.  My girlfriend love it so much and she said it was an amazing and beautiful show.  I am just glad i was able to watch it again.  You will enjoy the show and not be disappointed.
O,"Magical!

Breathtaking and captivating aesthetics; the water element of this show really is well done. Transitions were seamless and the music (live orchestra to the upper left and right of the stage) blended beautifully with the show. There is a lot going on though, so at times it was hard to figure out what to focus on. O was thoroughly entertaining and stimulating, despite there being no story line.

Seeing a Cirque show is a Vegas must. Looking forward to seeing the others!"
O,What are my eyes seeing?  Who imagined this stuff?  A sensory experience unlike any other.  Must experience.
O,"What a disappointment

Ive seen many Cirque shows and this was the one I was most excited about. Maybe its so hyped up, maybe my expectations were too high that it was a bigger let down.

The stage was the best Ive seen, no doubt about that. The costumes and music were amazing.  However, the acts were mediocre. Come on, its Cirque du Soleil!! I expected more than this. Ive seen traveling shows with more difficult and entertaining acts

All Cirque shows has funny acts in between to give the performers a chance to rest &amp; prepare for the next acts. O has the WORST. Not funny at all and it dragged.

Theres also no storyline."
O,"First off, Cirque due Soleil is an amazing company and my family and I are die hard fans. 
My mother introduced me to Cirque and has seen over 27 performances from the resident Las Vegas shows plus the traveling performances, and we decided to take her to O as a gift for finishing her last round of Chemo.
I bought 8 tickets for me and my family in row X, section 203 two days ago for the performance on Wednsday, two days ago.
Im not dogging the show or nitpicking any section of this performance- this is a five star show and deserves all the credit it has received, plus more.
The artists are incredible, the skill they show is absolutely stellar. They are amazing, and the dynamics of the  stage were phenomenal.
But they allow cell phone use and photos throughout the show- the majority of the audience was courteous enough to not abuse that privellage, but the guys being us were taking videos, talking loudly, and using FLASH with their photos.
My issue with them shouldnt reflect on this review, but the fact that no ushers were around to stop the issue! It sucked for us, but we can see it again I suppose- however, if a performer is jumping off a high platform and misses a step because theres an incredible light constantly flashing in their peripheral, the result could be catastrophic! 
We wanted to enjoy the art, not hold our breaths every time a flash was made thinking it would be the KA incident  all over again. 
Your ushers need to be policing this kind of stuff so much better than what they have been- you cannot play around with this kind of stuff!"
O,"THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!

The tickets are a pricey for sure.. made me think whether it was necessary.. but lemme tell u that it was worth every cent! 

The show is around for two hours, so you may wanna hit the restrooms before..and if you arent well rested you might feel its a little slow..but im glad i wasnt in any of the former situations so i actually got to enjoy every moment of it..( wouldnt say the same for my husband though)..

Such amazing acrobatics seen.. and the risk taken would make your heart skip a beat..
Try not missing out any, as there were lots of sequences.. all happening at the same time on different parts of the stage..its a little hard to keep up most of the times..

Oh ..and the music..it was not until the last we noticed the music was live too.. really thought it was some prerecorded tape. .

So if you arent in Vegas for much longer, and you really wanna sit and relax for one evening rather than shopping or walking through the casinos.. i would ask you to see the show once.. 

#DontMissOut #WorthIt"
O,"Im finally getting around to checking out these Cirque du Soleil shows. Because cmon, Im so over the clubbing nonsense of Vegas and can do Sin City classy.

Overall, this show is definitely worth checking out once when you come to Vegas.  There are moments in the show that it gets a little too much French-like humor and the outfits here leave ZERO imagination of the performers. I did go wow a couple of times throughout the 75 mins show.

Grab a seat towards the center back of the theatre as they utilize everything in the building. We got seats about 12th row back, so it was just perfect!"
O,"Ive seen a few Cirque shows (KA, Mystere, Love) an IMO this one was the best. The ticket prices definitely reflect this. They hardly ever have these tickets on special, so theres no need to wait. I would recommend getting a seat in the middle area, not too close to the stage. There is so much to look at, Im sure if you go again,  you can see something you missed the first time.
Sitting in the theater you can smell the pool water and feel the humidity in the room. Once the curtain opens, I was mesmerized. I had bought a drink before the show started and when the show ended I still had half of my drink. I was so into the show and the imagery that I ignored my drink. That doesnt happen very often. The acrobatics in this show are different than the others since you have the water feature, they didnt seem as jaw dropping, but they were enthralling none the less. My mind kept going back to the word creepy to describe what I was seeing. Maybe odd, sexy, and fun as well.
I dont want to give anything away, but I highly recommend this Cirque show."
O,"Bad show? Or did a series of unfortunate events skew my judgement?

First, we were seated in the balcony which is so far away it is impossible to enjoy the show. I have perfect vision and if i cant see from there the seats should not exist [or should cost less]. I was so disconnected from the performance it felt like i was watching TV. We booked 3 weeks before and those were the only seats.  Still cost me over $110 for a ticket. 

The show had some slow parts which were coupled with 0 audience interaction at my level. 

I fell asleep for a brief moment...yes i was tired going into this already and i had a large alcoholic drink to my face beforehand :) :)

I have to say, i appreciate these people 100%, the acrobatics are great, the performance was crazy but i really was not feeling this one at all. I go on entrainment factor and i was just not entertained. 

I learned my lesson, book early and sped the few extra dollars for the better seats. 

I WILL make it a point to go back one day and sit closer."
O,"Another Cirque performance that makes we want to do acrobatics!  This one is amazing plus some because of the water.  My friends and I all agreed the stage/pool was one of the coolest things we had ever seen.  One second it was a dry floor, then people were either flying into or coming out of the water.   They kept your attention elsewhere while the floor morphed into a pool and vice versa.

After we left, we heard there is a tour you can take of the inner workings.  This would be worth it after you saw the show to better understand that amazing floor!  

The athleticism is unbelievable, and I would really like to know how they have feet strong enough to hold on to a flying trapeze and another person at the same time. 

 I have never seen a Cirque show I did not like and this one did not disappoint."
O,"Im in love with Cirque shows to begin with. But O is my favorite. Not only do you get the usual amazing stunts and talented performers, but the water element is added. The divers and synchronized swimmers were amazing. I loved the show and give it two thumbs up!"
O,"This is my second Cirque show, Mystere being first. 

It is a water based show, very fitting to be in the Bellagio! But the stage moves around so at some points it is a dry stage. 

Shortly after the show starts, be sure to look up! I would have missed it if my friend didnt tap me to let me know (haha oops). If there was a story to the show, I couldnt really tell what it was. 

The costumes, makeup, and performances were amazing to say the least. The section I was sitting in, it was hard to see all the little details, but from what I could tell they were very interesting and some were even kind of like an illusion at some point. It is definitely like a circus without any animals. The acrobatics were pretty cool and it went well with their costumes. 

The music is live, if you look to the boxes by the stage youll sometimes see the singers and musicians performing! (only when they light the boxes up, sometimes its dark)

I believe this show is over hyped which was why I took one star away, I saw Mystere first and loved it, comparing the two, I would rather see Mystere again."
O,"Went to Vegas specifically for this show and glad I  was able to see it.  The synchronized swimming was amazing and my favorite scene was the thunderstorm.  Had seats in the balcony right side single section seats.  They were good seats to see everything, however the chair sat a few inches away from the balcony.  With that being said I had to sit on the edge of the chair to be able to see over the balcony which was a little uncomfortable.  Also, I felt that the theater was a little too cold."
O,"Cirque has done it once again.  This was a fantastic show and the wonderfully talent company did not disappoint this night.

We had very nice seats at the back of the theatre but not so far away as you were struggling to see the goings on.  In fact, the seats were like comfy arm chairs you have in your own living room in the far back row.  Im guessing they use them to accommodate the folks that need a bit more room, etc.  Im not sure how we ended up with the last two but we did.  Very nice.

There were some moments where I was fearful for the performers but only because I have a fear of heights and I dont know how they do this stuff.  

All in all incredible and awe inspiring.  A must see if you have the time while in the big city."
O,"Every moment of the show just left me in awe and delight.  It shows how much time, money and effort was put in the production of the show at the highest level one can think of.  I loved how the stage becomes a pool and then back to a stage and I loved how they incorporate the use of all elements in the show.  I love the acrobatics, the stage, production, costume, music, the water, everything!  I loved all of it!  Recommended to those who is looking for a show that will truly entertain."
O,"Absolutely incredible.

Unbelievable.

Amazing.

Spend the money and see this show. It will blow your mind."
O,"I was disappointed.  I probably wouldnt have bought tickets if I knew what itd be like.  None of the acts were that innovative, save a couple. I felt like a lot of the elements were interesting but ultimately didnt have much purpose in the story. Also while the clowns are somewhat amusing, Im getting pretty tired of them.  Seemed a lot like lots of things were going on on stage to cover up for the lack of any one thing being truly amazing.

Go for the beautiful costumes and music I guess (although then again they are hard to see from afar).

I was more amused with The art of Richard Macdonald, who did all those beautiful sculptures that were shown in the theatre entrance."
O,What an amazing stage! The water floor really makes a difference. Ive seen many Cirque shows here in Vegas and they definitely have their own style. I found O to be more visually beautiful with the combination of water and fire.  I was very impressed with the synchronized swimmers and the 3 Asian bends.  Overall it was a great show! In true Cirque style there is so much going on I dont know where to look and Im scared Ill miss something. Must see!
O,The most spectacular thing Ive ever seen. Period dot end. 20 stars! Everyone must see this show in their lifetime. Im not going to spoil it. Just get off your ass and go!
O,"I went to a Cirque to Soleil show in Toronto one time and I paid $65/ticket.  After the show, i thought to myself: WHAT A RIP

I went to O, paid $165/ticket, sat in the third row. During and after the show, I thought to myself, IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.

Its indescribable, you really just have to see it for yourself. But make sure you get good seats in the front so you can get splashed by the water, not from the dives of course, because these ex-Olympians dont splash when they dive into the stage (what?!). From what then? Im not telling.

 Id pay that much again to watch it. I really would."
O,"What a phenomenal production!  Having been a fan of Cirque du Soleil for years, I would say O is one of the best shows by the amazing troupe that Ive ever watched!!  What makes O extraordinary is the water theme as the stage itself is technically a huge pool!  The show consists of diving, synchronized swimming, and other water-based performances,and the performers act and move above, within and on the water!  The stage props and costumes are colorful and beautiful.  Seriously, one must watch the show ones self in order to understand and appreciate how incredible O is!"
O,"426 Reviews and their overall rating is still 4.5 stars! Well its no shocker or surprise how amazing this show is. I was in Vegas for New Years 2010 and one of our adventures included seeing this show. I had been wanting to see it since before I knew we were planning the trip. Its vibrant, full of colorful costumes and the performers are so in tune with each other making the entire show very harmonious. You need to arrive like 1 hour or so before if you dont want to stand in line for tickets or you can purchase them at your hotel concierge. They are always sold out, so dont wait until the last minute to get tickets. Its definitely a show that I 100% recommend. And when I go back I plan to see it again.  Youll leave the show wanting more as I did. 
ENJOY"
O,"Probably one of the best Cirque de Soleil shows ive seen. I wont spoil it for you, but its a must watch here in Vegas! I was able to sit close to the stage, and it really enhanced the experience for me. Get tix well in advanced as its quite popular."
O,"Absolutely amazing. The tickets are expensive but worth it. Its definitely worth paying a little more for the lower sections, but being super close isnt really necessary. There is so much going on to see youll be entertained from almost any view."
O,"This is absolutely the BEST of Cirque productions! The talent and design are second to none.

This  show is based at the Bellagio. The acts are busy,  and  continually stimulate the senses throughout the program. I would consider seeing the show a second time to enjoying everything thats happening.

The  music - especially the string instrumentals and singing - is magical. 

We sat in the 12th row and I think this was better than sitting closer to the stage because there are so many different things going on during the performance.

Regardless, O is a show thatll leave desired and positive memories regarding art, talent and technology."
O,"I cannot say enough good things about this show. Everything was fantastic, the swimmers, divers, acrobats... the stage management was amazing. 

I doubt there is a bad seat in the house. I was on the second row and worried that I wouldnt be able to appreciate everything on the wider scale, but it was still amazing and even better was being so close and seeing the costumes/makeup detailing.

The first two (or more) rows are in the splash zone so if youre sitting there prepare to get a little wet. 

Though sitting else where wont gurantee that you stay dry!

I cant wait to see it again (when I walked out of the theater I was tempted to buy tickets for the 10:30 show as well but my exhaustion after a long day of travel won out!).

Buy your ticket, you wont be disappointed!"
O,Fantastic show. Funny and very artistic. Would highly recommend. One of the best Cirque shows Ive seen
O,"This was our first Cirque show live.  I saw a Cirque show on TV once and this was boring compared to that.  I almost fell asleep multiple times.  So many 5 star reviews talking about how great it is.  If this is great, I will never waste my money on a Cirque show again.  First I checked Vegas.com for tickets and they wanted $400 for 2 seats.  I booked through the Bellagio and got the same seats for $200.  If you have never seen a Cirque I would pay close attention to the non 5 star reviews because thats how my wife &amp; I felt.  No story, leaving you with the though of what did I just see.  Its probably called O because youll be thinking O poop, I cant believe I spent that much money on this show."
O,"I was ready to write off Cirque du Soleil after seeing Love and MJ: The Experience, but it wouldnt be fair until I give the supposed best Cirque show a try. 

FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC. I was mesmerized, engaged, and leaning forward the entire time! The performers pulled you in, and it looked like they had so much fun. There isnt a dark emo, depressing story to distract you like Love. Everybodys having a good time, and all the athleticism is amazing - below and above water. Yea these tickets were a little expensive compared to other shows, but it was worth every penny!"
O,"O is fantabulous!  I cant exactly remember where we sat, since its been over a week.  It was about six rows from the stage on the middle-right side.  
Cant really complain about anything.  Just dont forget to get the O slushy/cocktail along with some popcorn and a magical soda (with free refills).  It really does complete the experience.  The citrusy O slushy was my most memorable Vegas drink."
O,"Incredible.  

The stage raises and lowers, to reveal a pool that the acrobats can dive into.  The acrobats and trapeze artists are always my favorite, but the high divers were so impressive.  Because of the water aspect, I found myself thinking how are they doing that?!

Quick tip, dont splurge on expensive seats.  We had seats along the side of the stage and up above, and we had no problem seeing the show.

Go see this show!"
O,"Feel a bit let down on this show.  After skimming through a few reviews.  I have to agree with nearly everything all of what the 3 star and below reviewers say.  Kind of too much going on, no real storyline that I could follow, just a bunch of random stuff, and nothing to really make you go WOW.

The underwater pool lift thing was already spoiled by my trip on the Oasis of the Seas cruise ship.  They have a show in the back of the ship that is similar to O.  In retrospect, that show was actually a bit more impressive because it had the same pool lift tricks, underwater entry points, guys underwater with scuba gear to supply performers with oxygen.  Oh and divers jumping from 30+ feet into a  22x52 17-foot deep pool on a MOVING ship."
O,"I have seen all Cirque shows and O is my favorite. The stage is amazing, the water is always changing with each act creating a surreal experience in combination with beautiful live music and amazing acrobatics and characters. I have seen the show a few times and would strongly recommend getting good seats to get the full experience, its just not the same when you sit far in the back."
O,"WHERE IS THIS WATER COMING FROM?! WHERE DOES IT GO?! HOW DO THESE PEOPLE BREATH?!

^^Recurring questions I had during this show. Im really giving it a 3.5!

Theater: Built like an old-time movie theater (amphiteater style). Most seats are decent (Balcony looked like it could strain your neck a bit). The ceiling is GORGEOUS, and water comes from up there (yep, crazy).

Acrobats: This Cirque show was probably my third favorite (after LOVE and KA), and Ive seen about five of them. Anything with water and acrobats and diving from a gagillion feet is labeled as impressive in my book. At the same time, having water restricts what types of tricks you can do. Some of the diving ones, although impressive, became repetitive.

Minus one star for price - EXPENSIVE. Oh dear, is it expensive. I wasnt even in the front (middle, left) and our tickets were $159ish not including sevice charge - eep. Im still on the fence of whether or not it was wholly worth it. Also, if youve been to a cirque show, you know that the actors walk around in the audience before the show to mess with you. Well, here they mess with you...and sometimes, its WITH water. Meh, not when Im all dressed and nice, please. Also, the funny nonacrobatic montages were overextended at times.

Overall, its entrancing, and if you have $$$$ to spend, Ill recommend it to you."
O,"We went to both mystere matinee show and the late showing of O on the same night. If you only see one show when youre in town make this the one. Definitely worth the upgrades in any sort of seats that are preferred. The sound, performance and story are just breathtaking. My third time watching the show over ten years and still breathtaking."
O,"While I love all Cirque shows, O is my favorite.  I saw it for the first time back in December of 2007, and just saw it for the second time in July of 2014.  Seven years later, it was just as incredible as I remembered. What really sets this show apart from the other Cirque shows is the element of water. On top of the amazing acrobatics, incredible live music, and mind blowing theatrics that Cirque is known for, O manages to also work impressive synchronized swimmers and high divers into the mix.  Water covers the massive stage, and you can never tell quite how deep it is. The pool must have several layers and compartments to it, because in one moment the water seems so shallow that it looks like the performers are doing jazz runs across the surface, but in the next moment someone will dive into the water from a trapeze height.  The visual effect is a powerful one, and the use of water really enhances the multi-sensory experience that Cirque is known for.

A few tips:
-Dont be late: they will not allow you to enter the show if you are late.

-Dont take photos: flash photography is forbidden, because it can distract and/or cause injury to the performers. A rude group next to us ignored this rule. They were promptly told to stop, and that they would have to leave if they did it again.

-Buy tickets early: unless you plan to get free tickets from the casino or are waiting for a deal of some sort, buy your seats early because the best ones go fast. Its ideal to sit in a center seat section instead of off to the right or left, because its easier to watch everything that is going on from the center."
O,I see why they call this show O It was completely entertaining the entire show. We were seated in the golden circle and the tickets were well worth it.
O,"Absolutely stunning show! Theres no way to describe the outstanding performance of the performers, and the dynamic staging of the pool and solid stages. This is really a must see....Some of the stunts will really take your breath away!"
O,"O was my first Cirque du Soleil viewing, and it was AMAZING! Initially, I did not know what to expect from the show. The layout was gorgeous and the performers were incredibly talented! There was a lot going on throughout and during various scenes, but it was all very unique. Overall, I was very impressed and it was fully worthwhile... This is a definite must-see!"
O,"I went to see O and Mystere during the same week in Aug 2012 and I have to say that O is severely overrated and overpriced.  I enjoyed Mystere so much more.   I also seen Le Reve twice and I prefer Le Reve to O. 

I had Mlife VIP seating smack in the middle, but 10 minutes into the show two couples came in late and the usher told us to move to the aisle so that the two couples could sit next to each other.  I could not believe they had us move to the aisle.

The couple didnt understand why I was so mad.  1) They took my seat.  2) They interrupted the show by coming in late  3)  they just stood there blocking the view.  

The interruption didnt help, but I thought the show was quite boring.

The set was beautiful. 
Synchronized swimming was boring. 
Clowns were not very funny. 
Diving was good. 

I just do not remember anything about this show that stood out."
O,"The highlight of our trip, this show had so much going on at one time. Extremely entertaining, nothing more needs to be said except spend the extra $$$ to sit in the front center section, totally worth it."
O,"Its absolutely breathtaking! Definately feels the most complete and well-rounded of the four cirque shows I visited. The stage design and lighting it particularly stunning. The performers are also very good, and the clowns are quite funny and endearing."
O,"Purchased tickets online before our trip. Picked up at box office. Next time I will spend the extra money and sit at the lower level. We sat in the balcony and missed some of the things in the beginning. A couple of the characters came out and went through the audience but we couldnt see.

Overall the show was good."
O,"I was gifted with front center seats for this phenomenal show.  The acrobatics, the diving, the surprises... Very abstract and fantasy.  Beautiful costumes.  The pools appear and then disappear before your eyes.  It was incredible!"
O,Such a beautiful and exciting show! Recommended my friends to see it too!! Their costumes were so great too. Wasnt too keen on the clowns though.
O,"I have been wanting to see O FOREVER!!!!  My wish finally came true for my 30th birthday as a gift from the boyfriend.  :)

The stage is ridiculous.  The way its constructed and the way it works are both mind-boggling.  

The entire show is gorgeous, and I even bought the soundtrack afterward.  During some Cirque shows, there is a lack of action around the main performance.  However, this is not the case here.  There might actually be too much side action!  I couldnt decide where to focus my eyes, and i was constantly scanning the stage for interesting characters and acrobatics/theatrics.

The only downside is that we came to the later show after a VERY filling (and wonderful) meal at Le Cirque, and midshow we were both drowsy.  I was having trouble staying awake, and the boyfriend was just about completely out.  So....I think both of us missed a great deal of the performance, which is upsetting, but was unavoidable."
O,"Wow-amazing!!! Best show Ive seen yet, worth every $$$... Go see it people, dont want to give anything away, but you will be in awe the entire show. Something going on at every corner..."
O,"Okay, I confess: I wasnt really successful at following the storyline, but who cares? It was nevertheless amazing!

Throughout the show, the beauty of the costume, the choreography, and the music awed me. The stage itself deserves a special mention. The design of this stage is incredible! In the beginning of the show, I wondered, where the hell are all these actors coming from? It almost felt like watching a magic show. From pre-show to the end, there is something going on all the time, so you are in constant state of entertainment.

I purchased the ticket at the day of the show, but I was still able to get great seats. Perhaps its because I went on a weekday. But I wouldnt recommend you to do what I did; go ahead and try to book the tickets in advance to get the best seats possible."
O,"Man this show is awesome. Theres no other way to describe it. If youre looking for shows to watch in Vegas, this is my recommendation. The engineering, make-ups, costumes and the choreography were fantastic and perfect in every way. The stage holds a 1.5 million gallon pool which is the centerpiece for the entire performance. Those immortals who performed out there were out of this world! I cant stress how much attention to details they put into this show. Simply a brilliant masterpiece in itself.
Yes it is a bit pricey, probably the most Ive ever paid for a show, but wow it is unlike anything youll ever see."
O,"we sat row B center stage and were BLOWN AWAY! This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The staging with appearing disappearing pool was just unreal.

I am sure there are ways to get deals, but we paid $170/each and would do it again in a heartbeat.

One warning (Row A got wet), row B was level with stage (phenomenal perspective) and only got a few drops (and one roll of TP!)"
O,"$170 for a ticket right smack at the center of the lower section less than 24 hours before the shows sold-out performance.  Yes, I was very lucky, and the show was worth every penny.

I think the best way to describe the show is with the use of adjectives:

amazing
beautiful
colorful
daring
fantastic - O (thanks Luis C!)
magical
magnificent
O-mazing (thanks Earl G!)
stunning

Oh, who am I kidding?  Janice C. is absolutely right.  There are no words to describe the grace and beauty of this show.  Youll just have to check it out the next time youre in Las Vegas.  Highly recommended, I left the theatre that night in complete awe!"
O,"Beautiful music with graceful acrobats performing amazing stunts and acts.  I couldnt really follow the story because there was so much going on, but it didnt really matter.  I was gasping and wow-ing with every leap and jump.  I was even amazed with how the stage transformed from a pool to dry land in seconds.  How the heck do they do that?!

The show was 1.5 hours but it went by way too fast.  Felt like less than an hour because you just wanna see more!  We had seats towards the middle off to the side-ish for $110 each.  The view was great!  Wouldnt have wanted to sit up too close because you wouldnt be able to see the whole show with acts in the water and sky.  We also opted for the 7:30pm show so we could go out at night time and I noticed prices are cheaper for the late show at 10pm so thats another way to save some mula.

Overall, I really enjoyed the unforgettable performances and am happy I finally got to see what everyones been raving about.  Totally recommend to see at least once in your lifetime!"
O,Awesome Cirque Show! I was so excited to finally be able to see this show. Loved the water aspect. Its amazing how the human body can move in all of those ways. So talented!!! If youre a Cirque fan you have to see this. :)
O,"OMG, OMG, OMG....SO FREAKING AMAZING!

I had seen Ka last time I was in Vegas and thought that was amazing but O blew it away!!!

We couldnt get tickets so we went and stood in the standby line....ALAS, we got seats 5 rows up.  I had never been that close before so it was really cool to be that close to the stage.  These people are amazing.  I cant even explain it, but I would definitely go back and it was WORTH the $$$.  

The floor kept going from floor to water to deep water....I was like in awe the entire time.  AMAZING...great for all ages!"
O,"I was a little disappointed with our O experience.  We spent a lot of money buying 8 front row seats and walked out a little less than thrilled.  The show opened with the usual cirque characters teasing the audience.  It included a huge water pour from the ceiling and completely soaked my brother and his fiance.  They were wet an cold for the entire show and werent offered a towel.

Im used to the death defying acts of cirque shows but this seemed more like glorified synchronized swimming.  Yes, the theater, costumes, and music were beautiful and some of the acrobatics were truly impressive, but it wasnt as great as I thought it would be.  Ive been more impressed with other cirque shows.

I also didnt understand the story.  Was there a story?  There were certain main characters, but I wasnt sure how it all tied together."
O,"Now that Ive seen 4 CDS shows (Ka, Love, O, and Mystere) as well as a random sampling of other strip shows.. I can honestly say this show is the best show on the strip! So freaking incredible.

Ive seen it twice (with a span of nearly 9 years between viewings), and both times it blew me away. The stage moving, the acrobatics, the imagery, the costumes.. WOW.

Ok tip time: Soo Ive sat on the floor and Ive sat in the balcony. I enjoyed both for different reasons. On the floor the show is more mysterious and exciting. The stage seems to magically disappear and turn into water.. you dont see the scuba divers under the set, etc, etc. From the balcony I could see the stage way better and how it worked. I could see the stage coming into view and where all that water goes.. etc. If you want to see how things work, sit in the balcony (especially on the edges). If you like blissful ignorance stick with the floor."
O,Ive seen KA and this was so much more intertaining. Loved the characters and the acts flowed well.  The theater and the underwater stage were incredible. We sat in the golden circle row f center and it was perfect. We got a little mist on us but nothing to worry about. If you havent seen it you should do it!
O,"My first and favorite Cirque show ever! 

The stage is awesome... i love watching the stage transform back and forth from pool to dry floor. 

Love the stunts, cirque du soleil performaces always amazes me. But This whole water theme just took my breath away. 

I saw this show few years ago and i cannot wait to see it again! Theres just way too much stuff going on that Im sure I have missed out on.  It is definitely a must see show when youre in vegas. And book early!"
O,"I saw this with my folks back in January 2001, but sat on the side with an OK view. However, it was a cool show, but not good as Blue Man Groups in Luxor. It would had been nice if they used live orchestra for music."
O,"As much as I dislike jacking up peoples expectations to extraordinary heights that are nearly impossible to meet, O was AMAZING!

I had not-so-great seats -- section 303 [center of the balcony a.k.a. the nosebleed section], row DD [2nd to last row].  However, there was a 25% discount mentioned on the Bellagio website, so it was only ~$85 per ticket for a Saturday night showing.

PROS of balcony seating
- You get to see how the stage works - its pretty cool &amp; complex
- Cheapest seats in the house

CONS of balcony seating
- ... Cheapest seats in the house
- You dont get as much detail (like facial expressions) since youre so far away.  Sometimes, people below were laughing, and we didnt know why.
- Since you can see everything, its sometimes hard to decide where to look because theres just so much going on.
- Folks tend to lean forward to get a better view.  If youre sitting behind one of these folks, then your view gets partially obstructed &amp; you have to lean sideways to see.

Despite the many drawbacks of sitting in the balcony, it was still a spectacular show, so definitely check it out if youre in Vegas!
---
Heres the Bellagios O website:
http://www.bellagio.com/o-cirque-du-soleil/o-cirque-du-soleil.aspx
-- In the right-hand panel, it should mention something like 25% off. If you cant get the discount to work on the Ticketmaster site, just call &amp; ask for the discount over the phone."
O,"I went to the 7/18 10pm showing. It started out great and I was very impressed with the swimming acts. However my experience was ruined by the technical difficulties about 3/4 of the show. They made us wait over 20 minutes then told us we would get a refund then turn around and said the issues were resolved. Once the show began again it only lasted another 10 minutes. It felt like an abrupt ending and I guess Ill never know if they skipped out on other acts due to technical difficulties they didnt want to tell us. Even though the show was great in the beginning, my experience was ruined overall. I was really bummed because I heard great things about the show but the ending just felt rushed and had too many issues."
O,"+++++++++++++++++++++SPOILER ALERT++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you know you are going to visit Vegas and you know a few months in advance, get your tickets asap.  I went through Bellagio website and got great ticks in first row, almost center.  The website will tell you if you are getting splash tickets.  We only got sprayed with some mist, but we did almost get hit with a oversize inner-tube getting tossed overboard, lol.  We thought wed have a souvenir, but one of the nice theater ushers came by and took it away.  

The clowns:  They start the show about 5 mins before the show.  Overall I didnt think any of their skits were too funny, except when they tried to get a lady in the audience to come up on stage.  The smaller clown was pretty funny getting up on the seat arms trying to drag her up onstage.  Their skits didnt provide as much of a comedy relief as they provided a welcome break from the audio and visual onslaught between the primary acts.  

As usual my main complaint is that there is way, way, way too much going on onstage during the acts.  You dont know where to look, b/c you are sure to miss something!  I do get tired too of the obligatory contortionist act, their antics just make me cringe with sympathetic pain, tho I am sure they probably arent in any themselves.  Im also getting weary of the obligatory going-into-the-audience-to-get-an-unsupecting-patron to come up on stage and get into the act, and said unsuspecting patron also pretending to be afraid of climbing the long rope ladder to the diving platform, when of course he is a world class diver and is actually part of the show.    

I will say that this show interacts more with the audience than other Cirque shows Ive been to.  It seems in one act that all the performers are running up or down the audience stairs, and if you are in the right place you may get screamed at by a wedding dress clad lovely, or sprayed with water by the clowns, or one of them may just get up on your seat arms to try to drag you on stage, or you may get winged by a wet inner tube.  

This show has a little bit of everything, including water in all its forms (mist, rain, lake, ocean, swamp) and its counterpart, fire.  As with almost all Cirque shows Ive seen there is usually one or two things that dont make sense and I could have done without.  I dont get the wedding dresses, and the scuba divers didnt contribute to the show at all (they show up, they disappear, thats it), if it doesnt move it forward, I say it shouldnt be in it, but thats just MHO.  Ditto the native dancer, and ditto the red-coated guys running back and forth over the stage.  Oddly enough the signs did make sense to me in a way, what world doesnt have its version of late night TV shows interrupted by sex call numbers, and the applause sign was more of a nod to nostalgia TV when audiences needed to be prompted; these got at least a chuckle from me.  

Overall this show is beautiful and magical, just the mechanics of the stage floor itself is amazing.  If you are a connoisseur of the body beautiful you will get eye candy overload during all the acts.  Do go.  This show should be on everyones bucket list (things to do during life before you kick the bucket)!  As for being good for kids, Im not sure about that.  I wouldnt take my 4yo neice or my 8 yo nephew, but for 12 and up it might be good."
O,"What a show! Totally in love with this one. Brandon, my husband, and I were so happy with this Cirque show. Great staff working the drinks and snacks."
O,Seen 10 shows to date and this show is truely AMAZING!!! The acts are top notch and unbelieveably dangerous! Sit like 10-15 rows back to that you can see the acts from up high. They do crazy acts from up high jumping into the water below. This is for sure one show I want to see again. The acts and music will mesmerize you!! Call to order tickets and you can chose where you want to sit. Discounts for this show are hard to find if any. Its a hauntingly beautiful show!!
O,"This was the first show I had ever seen... picking one show to watch from the many in Vegas was pretty difficult on its own... but paying for the tickets after finding out how much they were... was much more difficult. lol. At the end, I was very very happy with everything... the price was justified. 

A few things to note:
- It is much easier to get the seat you want if you call Bellagio. (there is a service charge but you are already spending $$$, whats another $ for better seats?)

- Id recommend sitting at the second tier. You can see everything very clearly and can enjoy the orchestra + singers who appear live on the windows to the left and right

- As mentioned above... there is a live orchestra + singers hidden behind windows on the left and right. Pretty amazing because I only noticed it half way through the show!

- There are no restrooms inside of the theater... so go before you get in line.

- The line forms before the show starts so you should try to go 30 min in advance. Or you can rush in right before the show starts and miss the pre-show comedy act entertainment."
O,"Likes: Show started off a bit slow but picked up with the fire section which was awesome.  Russian swings was my favorite part.  Loved all the water acrobatics and the solo acrobatic performance with the girl balancing on her head on a swing super high in the air with no safety ropes (at least I didnt see any).  Clowns were funny.  Contortionists usually weird me out but in this show it was just really pretty and artistic.  Live singers can be seen on the sides behind the glass windows.  Costumes and music are beautiful.  I like the zebras :)  Overall a great show!  (Equally as good as La Reve in my opinion)

Tips: Look for discounts or promotions!"
O,"The New Cirque de Sole show called Turek was horrible! We saw it in San Diego at the Sports Arena over Thanksgiving holiday week. It is NOT like any other Cirque show we have ever seen. It was based on Rob Camerons movie Avitar. There was no typical acrobatics, dance, and riveting artists acts; rather a bunch of people dressed up like animals swirling flags and swords around, and telling a story. Seriously!  It was a big disappointment and a total waste of money. NO one in our party of 12 enjoyed the show. It was terrible! I suggest you dont waste your time or money on this traveling atrocity!"
O,"This is probably my 3rd favorite Cirq... Zumanity #1, Mystere #2, then O.  Even though it is not a Cirq show, I saw Le Reve before seeing O and maybe that is what ruined it for me... Le Reve is so much more... FANTASTIC.  If you are planning to spend on a higher cost show, I would skip this and head to the Wynn in a heartbeat, you will not be sorry!
Dont get me wrong O is good...but to me, not worth the cost."
O,"This show was simply...
BREATHTAKING.

Words cannot express how magical it was. Without spoiling the show, I will try to describe the awesomeness of O.

Curtains opened like WHOOOSSSSHhhhh
did a little twirl, somehow disappeared into nowhere
Giant pool on the stage,
oh wait now its gone! Woah its a dry flat stage now!
Performers are popping out of the water... where did they come from? Dont they need to breath?

Ah stage fog. I love stage fog.

Why is that guy on fire?

Oh yeah I keep forgetting to look up. Performers are dropping in from the skies!

JUST GO SEE IT!
:)"
O,"Yes, indeed, I am the man who called Bull.... Baloney.   (Hey, kids read this website too.)   The title O makes good sense, as in Oh I cant believe I wasted this much money on this show.    I cant believe this show has a 4.5 star rating after almost 50 reviews.   

I am a fan of most Cirque du Soleil shows and this one really disappointed me.   The story line was not there... at least the other shows have some theme.   This seemed to be a collection of random thoughts by some drunk monkey.   Ok, I could have been wowed by some really cool acrobatics or other neat feats.   But, nope, I was really disappointed.   The theater seating was horrible, we were on the side seating of the balcony so we were almost looking down on the watery stage.   All of the magic was lost when we could clearly see what the cast was doing underwater.    It aint pretty folks.   

Save your time and money.   Go see Zumanity or Ka instead."
O,"Go Go GOOOOOOOO

Once in a lifetime at least.

O is the most special.


Love it

Best of all the Cirques


TIP:

Theater can be cold and then too warm
Dress in layers

Be awake dont drink before hand.

Ah OK I admit it was a few years ago I went - so if they now have a sign at the back that has a 1-800 number I will deduct at least 3 stars. Hope other reviewers do too. 

Hope to go again in the next year or so."
O,"Alright, spouse made me go. However I am glad she did. Wow, what a great show. Highly entertaining, and well worth the cost.

We both enjoy every minute and highly recommend if you are interested in a good show in Vegas"
O,"Well I could take this review in a slew of different directions, but Ill try to give an overview of my entire experience.  Seating, we were told that the bar in the front row of the upper balcony is considered obstructed view but the ticket agent said it isnt a problem.  So for 4 tickets and $489, it was a problem and here is why.  My two children couldnt see over the bar even though they are 10 and 12, so they had to lean forward in their seats to see.  Then the usher told them to sit back as to not block the view of the people behind us...ehhh?  My wife and I were on the aisle while the bar wasnt an issue, but the high rail at the bottom of the stairs was.  The entire right half of the stage, I had to view though iron railings....not ok.  I truly cant believe the tickets werent discounted, that is an absolute tragedy.

As for the storyline, well I have no idea if there was one and even my children said the same thing.

So what does this show offer?  Fantastic stunt work and high diving acrobatics, a beautiful theatre and set.  

Honestly if your are looking for a Cirque show and you can only go to one, Id pick KA.  The theatre is better, the show is better and the tickets are more affordable than O."
O,"I thought O was very well produced, but not one of the best Cirque du Soleil that Ive seen (Ive seen about 5+ by now). It was much better than KA for sure.

We sat in the 2nd row (Id recommend sitting row 5-10). The water effects are amazing and the dancing is very well choreographed. However, I didnt understand the overall theme of the show. Acrobats were a bit lacking in comparison to other Cirques. 

Its definitely worth seeing, but I would not put this as #1."
O,"This is an amazing show.  The acrobatics, the water, the costumes, the set designs... I could go on and on.  Ive seen the show twice now and both times left completely mesmerized.  The clowns on the houseboat were so adorably funny.

The water filled stage and risings will have you completely filled with astonishment.  Its definitely worth paying for the higher priced ticket."
O,"Ive never gone to a Cirque show before and I am so glad that I finally had the chance to see O. It will BLOW YOU AWAY with its brilliance and masterful performances.

Its at the Bellagio, and I dont even know how to begin to describe the stage. Whoever designed that stage and built it--they have my utmost respect. GENIUSES. And the performers! The strength that they have in their bodies... and the way they have such perfect control over them... utterly amazing.

There really isnt any story in O, but its a visual masterpiece that you will not regret watching. And if youre a little tight on your budget, the 10pm showing offers discounted seats (not for aisle though, which are always more expensive). Definitely a must see.

And obviously ditto to everything in Misti Y.s review :)"
O,"There is simply no better show in Vegas and O is by far the best of the Cirque Du Soleil shows.  The arena / concert hall that it is performed in is top notch and with a dark decor that sets the mood just perfectly as the seats are comfortable from the balcony to the wet seats.  I prefer the wet seats as you are closest to the action and no one really gets all that soaked from the water acts.

The choreography is breathtaking, the singing (in their unknown lyrical language) is fantastic, and they feature some of the most beautiful ballet, acrobatics, gymnastics one could ask for.  The story is clear, yet there is no dialogue throughout the entire show.  Its artsy, but downright impressive.  Words cant possibly describe the magnitude of this show and the Bellagio should thank their lucky stars to have landed such an amazing gem of a show that will hopefully continue for years on end."
O,"O my God was this a good show!! We had third row seats and I wouldnt have sat much farther back because alot happens close to the stage. The clowns that open the show are so funny and once the show starts it is just mouth dropping amazement throughout the entire time.
If there was a story line, I have no clue what it was, but that didnt stop from the enjoyment of the show. Several times throughout the show my husband and I would turn to each other and say I have no idea whats going on, but I love it! The acrobatics are amazing and there are several surprises from plants in the show too. The most amazing part though was the curtain draw. NOTHING beats the curtain draw. For those that have seen it, you know what I mean.
I will definitely be seeing this one again. :)"
O,"Its  amazing show,you cannot skip this show if you go to Vegas.Performers did great .The show has humor,romance and acrobatics,really cool.Worth every penny!"
O,"Im happy that I got a promo price on these tickets as my hubby and I left far less than pleased. This is the final cirque show that we wanted to see in Vegas (have been to Ka, Zumanity and Mystere. Have no interest in Love or Criss Angel) and since I was told that it was the best of all the cirque shows I was excited to leave this one for last. 

Well... I didnt get it. I know that the story lines of the cirque shows can be complicated but not my husband, nor myself could makes heads or tails of this one.  Besides the lack of storyline, my husband told me afterward that he actually nodded off twice! I was a bit relieved because I thought it was just me who was having trouble staying awake. 

The diving was the best part of the show. The weird French Canadian clowns were the worst part. If you havent seen KA yet, go there instead of this one."
O,"Spectacular!! Marvelous!! Inspirational!! I absolutely loved seeing this show. Such a rich, creative and brilliant production. I know the show has been running for 18 years, I suppose the only thing I thought could make it better would be updating or remixing the music to make some of it a little more modern."
O,"Do not let the price deter you. It is worth it.

This is my 1st Cirque show. Ive wanted to see it for years. Its amazing. Its 1000x better than I thought it would be and I thought it would be good.

I loved it.  I want to see it again with my children. 

I love the music. This is a very good experience and its very worth it."
O,"3.5

I have been dying to see this show in forever!!!!! Seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows (Iris- love the music but its ending in week!, Criss Angel--can you even call it Cirque Du Soleil???). 

Weve been going to Vegas for the past few years but never got the chance to see it--sold out the last time! So before leaving, I checked Bellagios website and they had a 15% Internet discount. The website was having some issues so I called. They were great in answering all my questions. I asked her about the seating arrangements and the differences in price. There was no pressure, but she did mention that the front seats would give you a much better view of the stage since there wasnt too many aerial movements and that if I could afford them, I should. With the discount, each ticket ended up being $147 and then with fees, the total was about $ 308. 

Gorgeous, gorgeous stage. Definitely worth sitting up front so you can see how they do the acts.You will be surprised at how they were able to make the stage support each act, as they had a pool under the stage.  

The show was beautiful, but I wish it had more substance. Maybe a story perhaps? I felt that Iris had that a bit more. At the boat scene was a bit long as well. But i liked it when the clown said Aye yai yai. Really cute. 

Was the show worth it? Yes. It was a buffet for the eyes. A big, tasty buffet that I can brag to my friends about. But would I see it again? Eh. But my mom loved it so I was a happy camper."
O,"I have seen this show a few times and it never gets old.. knowing that humans are capable of such things fascinates me... 

The staging, music and costuming alone is amazing, but the performances... they truly are jaw dropping..  one minute someone is running across the water, the next second a high diver  plunges into the same exact spot... the coordination of the elements with the performers creates a breath-taking, mesmerizing spectacle. I do have to say.. WHERE you sit, makes a HUGE difference.. if you CAN splurge to get closer and toward the center..  but anywhere near the front is great..  

It is both funny and heart-breaking.. everything is communicated in movement and music - as there are no speaking lines in the performance beyond shouts and gibberish.. yet you understand..

Must see before you die!"
O,"There were several times I said to myself, Stop. Remember this moment. The artists, the music, the picaresque beauty made me excited as a small child. If you can, go."
O,"If you have ever been to any circus you have seen the acts in this Cirque show. The only difference is the size and setting. The acts are very good and the acrobats very talented, but we were somewhat disappointed after reading all of the glowing reviews and after paying the highest price for any Cirque Show in Vegas. It just didnt wow us. We will try one more Cirque show, maybe Michael Jackson or something like that, but O was very over rated, in our opinion and the prices were just not worth it. I DO HIGHLY recommend Le Reve at the Wynn. Hands down better than any Cirque show."
O,"Pros: You will never see anything quite like this in your life. 
Cons: 20-30 mins too long, no story."
O,"Amazing!! This show sets the bar for al other Vegas shows and blows them out of the water, literally. Amazing and totally worth the money and time. Highly recommend"
O,"This was an amazing circus show. Ive never seen anything like it before. I was just thinking to myself the whole time... how do that do that? and that looks like so much fun, I wanna do it too! LoL."
O,"I really wish I could leave a great, long review, but I cant. Sadly I dont know if it was the stomach flu or severe dehydration but I wasnt feeling good for most of the show and fainted at one point. I didnt get to see it all, but from what I did see...it was brilliant! 

We bought the CD, because the music and live singing was marvelous. It was a breathtaking show! Just wish I witnessed it all instead of passing out :(

Definitely recommend this show to everyone! MUST SEE!"
O,"When O (pronounced the same way as eau, which of course is French for water) opened, several years ago (wow, I just checked, it was 12 years ago!), it was the only reason I ever wanted to go to Vegas. Tickets needed to be bought months in advance, and trips to Las Vegas were planned around when you could get tickets for O.

Luckily its a little easier to get tickets now, but you still want to book them as early as possible. While a friend claims she got discounted tickets for a same-day show, I would not count on this. This is one show you want to buy your tickets for as far in advance as possible, especially if you want the seats closer to the stage.

Ive been to several (albeit traveling) Cirque du Soleil shows, and while they are always very entertaining, they do tend (IMHO) to all feel the same. O changes my perspective on this completely. It is the most amazing show I ever ever seen. Short of natural wonders, Im compelled to label it as a must see venue (definitely add it to your bucket list). 

Do get there early... The show actually starts during seating (house lights are still on). Center front would be great seats. We were the 5th row, slightly off to the side, and it was fantastic (though if I have a chance to see the show again, I will do so from further back so I can take in the whole stage at once). 

The story seems to center around Guifa, a young boy (based on the cap he wears), whose curiosity takes him to a magical place where his imaginations come true. He is a willing captive throughout the adventure.

The stage, costumes and acts are all amazing. A few in our party of 6 complained about the clowns (not so much the clowns, but the duration of the clowns), which we all thought a clever distraction while the underwater equipment was changed.

The show really is too much for a single review. I think its pretty safe to say if you have ever enjoyed any Cirque du Soleil show, you will love O. However, if its your first, it may diminish the grandeur of the other shows (which are still great shows)."
O,"Beautiful costumes, acrobatics, and music.  I love that they have live music!  The story (is there really one?) lacked a bit for me... but if you just focus on the moves, it is lovely."
O,"Oh my god I was amazed with this place. The performance is awesome, and they interact with the audience. They have live music for the show and the singer has an incredible voice. I would totally recommend it to everybody, the tickets are expensive but so worth it. The clowns are lovely and funny."
O,"This is THE Cirque show to see if you only have one to go to. It is the most memorable of the Cirque shows I have seen in Vegas. Dont worry about where you sit, every time I have seen it, I have sat somewhere else, and get to see something new each time.

The athleticism of the performers shows and is awe inspiring!

I cant wait to see the show again, sit somewhere new and see what I did not notice before."
O,"Words to describe the show?

Romantic

ahhh I fell in love with this show...and I want to see it a few more times!"
O,It should have been great coz my husband was awake the entire show for the first time.
O,"besides the fact that i lost all my fucking money at the piece of shit bellagio this show was SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i dont understand how anyone can give this less than 4 stars!

the stage is huge, the acts were great, the songs were exciting, and the clowns were SO CUTE! 

let me tell you.. anything with water and fire is fucking exciting and if you think its not then you live a sad life and youre lame as fuck.

GO WATCH O!! its worth the $22348230948293042.99 or however much youre paying for this show. :)"
O,"My first (and only) cirque show and an absolute stunning experience!  The visuals, sounds, and interaction were perfectly integrated and the enthusiasm of the cast was beautifully emanated to the crowd.

My boyfriend at the time took me to this show on what he termed the amazing date and it would have been had he not followed the show by asking me if I enjoyed the storyline, which I didnt follow at all.  I felt like a complete idiot.  I did my research though to find out what I missed.  Dont be intimidated or feel less than folks, there is no story line.  Enjoy the show for what it is - a celebration of theater and the infinite possibilities of creativity!"
O,"Another fabulous Cirque Show!  O was incredibly visually stimulating.  Unlike Zumanity, the theater is huge...so having a balcony seat may not be the best way to go...tickets are expensive (in comparison to the other Cirque shows) but O is definitely the best Cirque show I have seen.  Its absolutely stunning...you cant look away!"
O,"Came here last Thursday night for the 10:00 PM showing. I was visiting Vegas for the first time with a friend, and she got us the tickets. We had great seats! Front row right hand side. 

O was like any other Cirque show, in that it is hard to give them anything but glowingly positive reviews. The show is an experience, and you are happy to be there.

I have now been to 4 Cirque shows, and O stands out as the most visually stunning. The art design and set, trump any of the other shows I have seen, even if the acrobatics, and other acts are not as spectacular.

The opening scene, and the whole experience, was stunning, and drew me in to a beautiful realm of intrigue and magic. I even got teary eyed. I really enjoyed going to this show, and consider it an experience that I am glad to have had.

Definitely check out one of the most spectacular Cirque shows around.

Any Cirque show you see becomes a magical and memorable experience."
O,"I saw Cirque Du Soleil - Ovo (for $80 each!) in Santa Monica California back in February and couldnt wait to see O.  We paid double the price that we had paid for Ovo to see O. We paid $164 each so expected it to be mind blowing. We had third row seats - a PERFECT view of the stage. 

They had some awesome stunts and it was amazing how the stage constantly changed from liquid to solid. I loved the fact that it was mainly in the water too. Too much acting that wasnt funny though. I paid $160 to see acrobats, contortionists, divers, etc. Not to see clowns prancing around trying to make the audience laugh. In Ovo there was so many moments that my mouth was dropped to the floor in amazement. There were only a few in O. I was so surprised. And the show is only an hour and a half long. Ovo was 2 hours and I paid half the price for it. It was just disappointing because I fell in love with Cirque du Soleil after seeing Ovo and O was not what I thought it would be. Still amazing and entertaining but I thought it would be so much more.

Theater is BEAUTIFUL. Entrance is BEAUTIFUL with tons of amazing art sculptures. Next time Im in Vegas Im gonna try Ka."
O,"Amazing!! What they say about this show is really true! The acrobatics are phenomenal but the set design including the unbelievable pool that basically appears and disappears is like living in a fantasy world. The costumes provide even more visual interest and the music is live and keeps your attention throughout the show. It may seem expensive for a 90 minute show, but the work, talent, and artistry that goes into every second of the performance is worth every penny. We booked the day of the show (on a Wed.) and we got 15% off at the box office for tickets in the front orchestra."
O,"Absolutely fabulous. 

I watched Le Reve prior to seeing O and O definitely trumps Le Reve hands down. 

The clowns were hilarious! Aye-aye-aye! Their humor was a great contrast to the dramatics of the rest of the show. 

The stage is amaaaaazing. Its water then its a stage then its both at the same time! 

I highly recommend getting the expensive tickets (a pair cost my fiance $340) but you get the best view possible. We were in section 103, row K and not only got a full view of the stage and aerial acts but also you can see the performers facial expressions and intricate movements. 

The entire show from start to end was just stunning. 

NOTE: This is one of the shows where they take pictures of you at the beginning and you can purchase them at the end of the show in a special keepsake O frame. Theyre $45 but well worth it. The ones I got came out beautiful and they even had the date on it which means a lot since we saw O on my birthday!!!"
O,"Absolutely a beautifully choreagraphed, mesmerizing performance. And before I forget to say this, CALL AHEAD AND SEE IF ANY LIMITED VIEW SEATING is available. We got seats for 2/3 the price of the ones right next to us (in 4th row of upper orchestra). We really had no problems seeing the stage or the performers, and the only reason they call these seats limited view is because there is a handrail or guardrail that blocks 5-10% of the stage in your line of sight. The reality, is that the people sitting in front of us blocked more of the edge of the stage than the guardrails, so that was not even an issue for us!

so briefly, acrobatics, synchronized swimming, diving, an interesting story line, crowd involvement, and of course, their wonderful clown transitional performances just do such a sensational job of drawing you in to each and every moment of the performance. The only thing is that there is always SO MUCH to see that is going on simultaneously that you cant possibly catch it all! 

If you are looking for a classy demonstration of raw power, yet elegance, grandiosity, but yet refinement, then come and check out O."
O,"I had always wanted to see the mother of all Cirque De Soleil shows, presumably O at the Bellagio, but tickets were always sold out while I was in Vegas. Somehow this past July 4 weekend, I was able to get tickets only a couple days before I left home.

I had seen all other Cirque de Soleil shows in Vegas, such as: KA, Zumanity, Mystere, Le Reve, so my expectation for this O show was very high. 

The stage for O was the most elaborate and beautiful. I give it a 5-star. But the show itself was boring. It was nothing but a bunch of acrobatic performances. Ive seen them all already at the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino(minus the water) in Vegas and the shows there were free, I didnt have to pay a dime for it. Somehow they perform the same stunts at the O and they charge you $200 to see it.

There were a lot of things going on around the stage while the main act is undergoing. Actors were running around, yelling, singing, dancing but its just to give you an impression that the show is big and the acts are grand but in reality they know the acts are boring so basically they have a bunch of people running around so the audience doesnt fall asleep.

Basically its nothing but a bunch of boring acrobatic performances in a beautiful theater. Thats all there is to it."
O,"I know this show is supposed to be amazing and Im pretty sure it is the most popular Cirque show on the Strip, but I was a little underwhelmed.

We were seated in the fourth row (so close!) and so I had a great view of the action. Amazing costumes, makeup, and actors.

Heres the thing: there is soooooooooo much going on, that you cant focus and follow along.  Also, there isnt really a storyline and its a jumble of acts.  Case in point: at one moment in the show, there is a man completely engulfed in flames who walks across the stage, crazy sea monsters coming out of the water, men dressed in French aristocratic servant clothes marching across the stage, and a butler who looks like Riff Raff from Rocky Horror dancing...all at the same time.  At that point I literally turned to my husband and said, What the eff is this shhh? (You can fill in the euphemisms Im sure).

In terms of water based shows, I like La Reve better. And in terms of acrobatics and circustry, I liked Zumanity and Absinthe better.  I just think there are some better shows out there."
O,"Amazing!!! It makes you realize and be grateful that there are people out there with the imagination to create such a story and presentation and those that can execute it.  Ive seen quite a few Cirque shows and this one is at the top of my list.  I would recommend it to anyone, even if you think youve seen it all, you really havent."
O,"Came here during the Dream Fight Dela Hoya vs. Pacquiao weekend at 6PM for the 7:30 showing to pick up the tickets I had reserved online through the Bellagio website.

Picking up the tickets was very quick and as we had no problems whatsoever with that.  While waiting before the doors opened at 7PM, we decided to gamble a little bit on the slots.  We managed to come up $50 so we just stopped as we proceeded to enter the theatre.  Approached by a photographer, we had a couple shots taken of us in the beginning before being seated.  The photographers will approach you anywhere if you are a family or a couple so be prepared to cheese it wherever you are stopped.  

We had seats that were limited view, but to be quite honest, the view was fine for me and Im not even a tall person so if youre unsure about purchasing obstructed view seating, its not as bad as you think.  The first 15 rows are labeled as wet seats as we were in the 19th row in section 203 giving us a great view of everything going on.  

The show itself was very exciting and really captivating! There are a lot of things going on and its probably one that many wont be able to fully interpret.  Even I didnt really understand, but until you realize that your own audience becomes a part of the storyline, then it all ties together lol.  Its just a really awesome show to watch and definitely worth the money that we paid for to see it.  If you havent seen this show, I would highly suggest it as it is one of the shows on the strip that never fail to perform!!!"
O,"This was the first thing my friends did when we planned our Vegas Trip, buy the tickets for this show.
I must admit I wasnt too excited about it.  Ive never really liked circuses or acrobats so, I thought I wouldnt like it.  Was I wrong.
I LOVED it!  

No matter where youre seating youll have a great view.  Theres always something going on at every angle of the stage.  Even if you look up youll see singers.  Theres comedy, beautiful music, water, acrobats, clowns, and more.  The Clowns I dont really like but here were ok, I was having such I great time I didnt mind them, actually, they even made me laugh a bit.

This is another great show for the whole family, people of all ages.  
Definitely worth going.  It will leave you wanting to check the rest of the Cirque du Soleil shows."
O,"BIt of an overpriced Snooze Fest in my opinion.
Will go again someday to see if it was just me and the time I went....."
O,"Out of the 5 Cirque shows that Ive seen, O is by far the MOST AWESOME!

Made even MORE awesome by the GREAT deal David G and I got on tickets through seller pcl_las on eBay (2 center orchestra tickets, Section 103, Row K, seats 5&amp;6 - $170/seat face value, for $240 total - delivered to our hotel), this was the most memorable show experience Ive ever had.

Between the lithe acrobats, the stunning costumes and changing set, the live music and mesmerizing singing, and the WATER element, I was almost moved to tears during this spectacular performance.  Ive loved all the Cirque shows, and yet have never wanted to see a repeat of any of them - until this one.

Something about that water element made it so amazing!

If youre going to Vegas, Id highly recommend seeing this show.  But look for tickets on eBay first.  If youre as lucky as we were, seller Patty (pcllas.lv@yahoo.com) will make your show experience even more memorable than you can imagine!!"
O,"Absolutely amazing!! Very unique and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I dont know how many times I said, Wow! We were on the 2nd row - the supposed splash zone, but we didnt get wet at all. So glad we were up close and personal! I loved the clowns, too. I got to play with them in the spotlight and take home their inner tube!"
O,"This is one of the most amazing things Ive seen in my life, if you come to las vegas you need to see this show, its incredible!!!"
O,"O M G. O took my breath away.

Swimming pool on the stage? Check. 
Diving board 50ft up in the air? Check
Contortionists? Check
Glitzy Vegas surroundings? Check
Great music? Check
Possibility to buy the CD at the door? Check.

But O Cirque du Soleil, you had me at the swimming pool. (tear)"
O,"Cirque du Soleil shows always amaze me.  O is no exception.  Im glad that I was finally able to watch it during my last trip to Vegas, since its always sold out whenever I go.

Theres a lot that you can like about O.  incredible water acrobatics, comedy, amazing contortionists, and great music.  There are definitely a lot of amazing moments going on in the 90 minutes that you spend in the O Theatre.   

Sadly, I cant say that its my favorite out of the 3 CdS shows Ive seen.  Maybe it was the high expectations that I had for it since everyone said it was the best show theyve ever seen and also its won many awards.  Personally I liked both KA and LOVE a lot better but thats just my personal taste.  Overall, despite it not being my favorite, its still worthy of earning 5 stars from me because of the high production value and it is a definite must see when youre in Vegas."
O,"Incredible! Eye appealing! Weve seen a few other Cirque shows, but O was by far the best. Great stage production. I thought it was so cool how the pool opens up, and before your eyes turns into a floor. You can even see the band, and vocalist performing up on the side booths. Great music, great acrobatics, cant say enough. Well worth the price. Make sure you have an M Card to get the best pricing at the box office."
O,"Everyone says this is the show to go to. I went to it for my first experience of Cirque du Soleil and was so bored. You watch people dive into water for an hour and a half, not really something that could hold my attention."
O,"O was the second Cirque show that I have seen. Mystere was the first. Although O is the more elaborate production, I still prefer Mystere. Cant really say why, sorry. O really is a spectacular show. The staging is very complex. One second someone is walking in a couple of inches of water, and all of a sudden someone dives into the same spot and its a deep pool. I guess you can say they really mess with your mind. I recommend getting a couple of drinks into you in order to take full advantage of the insane staging of this show.  

As far as the good for kids, I checked off not sure. Everyone knows their own kids, so you need to determine their maturity level. This show is more adult than Mystere or Love, so if you have kids along and are not sure, you might want to go for one of those. (you can read my reviews on both)."
O,This show is an absolute must see In LAS Vegas. It has been in production since 1998 and is still consistently sold out. The best production value of any show I have ever seen. Such a gorgeous theater.
O,"To summarize with one word: STUNNING.

If I could rename the O show, I would call it the O So Random show.  Lots of water.  Fire.  Clowns.  Weddings.  Ships.  Spaceship.  Random.

Im sure there was a storyline of some sort behind the production, but I was too busy staring at the acrobatics to even follow the story.  But thats okay.  This show is all about intaking the stage and performers with your eyes.  So much is happening at once and while I want to concentrate on the center act, my eyes were drawing attention to the ensemble and other parts of the stage.

Loved the fire poi and any of the diving acts.   Just amazing.

And my mom really, really enjoyed it, which is rare since shes Asian, doesnt understand anything, and mostly just complains about how things dont make sense and suck, but she absolutely LOVED this."
O,"We saw O &amp; Ka enjoyed them both.
Something you just have to experience for yourself.  Truly spectacular!  Great way to spend an evening in Vegas."
O,"O is all the things you love about the Olympics rolled into 1 show: Diving &amp; gymnatics. And if syncronized swimming and clown acts are your faves, well, added bonus.

Do yourself a favor and read the website or wikipedia about the show. Almost everyone in my party was confused about what the hell was going on. Theres a back story, but not.

Have ADHD? This show is for you! There are sooooooooooooo many things going on at the same time - I wasnt sure where to focus my attention!

The auditorium is supposed to be a sort-of replica of an ancient theater. Unfortunately, if youre in the 300 section, row 2 and above, you miss some of the show. The clowns do something down below, I could only see a bit of it without risking falling to my death. Good thing I hate clowns!"
O,"3rd favorite Cirque show on The Strip. A little bit hard to follow, but beautiful to watch. Outstanding diving!"
O,I dont know how people can give this a bad review unless you dont know what youre going to see.  Maybe cirque du solleil isnt you thing; then go see a comedy show because you are wasting a seat.  The performers are amazing.  Yes the story line is weird and hard to follow but you arent there for the story.  My wife was upset that I spent so much and tickets and she thought it was going to be stupid...but she quickly changed her mind.  She wants to go again.  This show gives the term O-face a new meaning.
O,"Best Cirque show Ive seen, ever.  I love the Cirque shows and have seen several, this one cant travel due to the elaborate set so I strongly recommend seeing it if youre in town.  The music was awesome too.

Sat in the 200 level and saw very well but it would have been perfect to middle of 100 section at lower level.  Dont sit too close or youll be looking up and all around to take it all in.  Leaving the show after it ends is pretty slow so dont expect to get out of the theater until ~20 minutes after the show.

I thought some parts were pretty scary for kids under 7-8.  Just the costumes etc."
O,"Did anyone else see the 1-800 number on the sign during the performance? 2/3 of the way through...one of the characters carried a sign across the furthest point back on the stage. The sign read 1-800-724-HOTT (or something similar). 

Really? I just paid $250 for tickets and spotted a very subtle ad for a sex hotline in the middle of the show. I dont know, I was shocked, but I certainly wasnt the only one who saw it. It just seems sickening to think of how much tickets cost, and yet the company is still seeking out ad revenue.

And just as reference, the sign was the exact same size, style and print as the Applaud sign that shows up near the end of the show. And carried by the same character, only on the front part of the stage, not the back.

Otherwise, the performance was spectacular. 

The limited view seating does save you a good chunk of money. I chose this option. The seats we sat in were just barely, BARELY blocked by a hand railing. You can see the view from the seat on the Bellagio website, but I guarantee you will be happy having saved the money, still sitting closer to the front, and seeing a bit of guard rail on the stage. Its worth the savings by far."
O,"Fun and campy (on purpose). If you are willing to take the whole thing lightly you will have a blast. If you have very specific ideas about sex and sexuality you might feel more comfortable elsewhere. 

My group had a blast. Lots of laughs."
O,"This show moved me. Breathtaking and beautiful, from the movement to the music. A must see, worth all the money for good seats!"
O,"O is breathtaking and beautiful. I loved it.  After seeing Mystere and Elvis too, both great Cirque shows, I can say that O is my favorite. It has great stunts and a good storyline.

My advice on seating is to go for section 203. It in the middle; its low enough to see well, but high enough to see everything. And as far as buying tickets, we went to the box office the day before and got tickets for Fridays 7:30 show easily. 

Go see it and enjoy."
O,"O is fabulously uneven.  It really deserves 2.5 stars, but I had to round down, considering how spendy it is.  I had never seen it before this past week, but the show is 14 years old now and feels almost zombified - like no one is at the helm, which is no surprise, since the director left Cirque not long after directing it.

I dont know how different it is now from what it was, but there seem to be 3 separate shows inside O, only one of which is actually worth watching.  The show that the curtain rises on is very interesting and involves the whole (immense) stage in the creation of a unified environment.  Soon, however, we find ourselves in the other shows, watching an overlong clowning act or neon-costumed contortionists on a giant kickboard.

The performers never shrink the theater - that is, make everyone in every seat feel like they are right down center, seeing the show up close.  The Blue Men do this, and their theater in Vegas seems almost as large as this theater.

Forgetting the price, its just not worth spending part of your vacation in the O theater.  Le Reve is a much better, and better put together, show that never distances the audience from the performance, as well as being far less uneven.

O left me with a resounding meh."
O,"I was surprised with front row seats to O for my birthday which automatically made the show 5 stars. Ive seen several of the Cirque shows and have to say that O was my favorite. I was amazed by the technique of the acrobats and all of the little details involved in the show. The costume design was simply exquisite and the music was magical.

Bottom line, I would definitely see O again and if you can, Id recommend splurging on front row seats, its worth it!!"
O,"Great!  Its been over 2 years
&amp; it it is stil wonderful!.  Cirirque du soleil O is so good.  I get carried away.  Everyone is amazing!"
O,"I strive to be comprehensively balanced on my reviews, but still it may come as a surprise to many that Im giving O only 3 stars (well actually 3.5... well now actually 4... see at the end)

Theres a saying in Vegas, not what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Another saying something like, Were in Vegas, lets go back some bad decisions.  Cirque O is probably the BEST bad decision you can make in Vegas in my opinion.

The show itself is 4.5 stars in my book.  The missing half star is because for me, the WOW factor was not quite what I expected for the price of the ticket and the hype from all the other reviewers.  But nonetheless, the show can be appropriately described as spectacular.  One criticism I have is the stage is VERY deep so it can be hard to make out the characters in the back of the stage.  A small pair of binoculars (if you are sitting in back) would be a great tool to fully enjoy the amazing costumes.  Also I caution, that I would not recommend sitting in the first dozen or so rows.  Much of the show takes place high in the air, and you will have a much better perspective sitting about mid-way back.

So why only 3.5 stars?  The price.  Yes, yes, I know, everything in Vegas is about 80% overpriced nowadays.  Its the law of supply and demand and the theme of excess rampant throughout the town.  But to me, thats no excuse for a mediocre value, and that is what O is.  For $170 per person (unless you sit in the balcony or get a partially obstructed view) for a 1.5 hour show, it IS described at BEST a MEDIOCRE value.  Thats $680 for a family of four.  You can do quite a few more interactive and cool and longer lasting activities for $680 for a family of four.  Think about it.

If money is virtually no object, O is a no brainer.  But if you like to get some decent value for your entertainment dollar, you can maximize it with Cirque by managing your expectations going in which I didnt and that was my mistake and the partial fault of many other reviewers which seemingly have a lower amazement threshold than myself.  To each their own though.

So where did I sit you ask?  After careful consideration, we chose the first row of the balcony and it was a good decision (yes I know it may be ironic Im complaining about the value when I bought the $40 cheaper seats - but Im writing the review considering the vast majority of the seats are the higher price.)  You will have to lean forward to look over the railing to see things that are happening in the very front of the stage and in the crowd.  The perspective is great, you are at eyes level with much of the show in the air and have a good perspective on the deeper area of the stage and see some of the synchronized swimming moves from a better elevated perspective, I would NOT sit in the balcony in any other row though as there is occasional action in the crowd below that is fun to watch that you cant see from the other rows in the balcony.  I think the best seats would be the first few rows of the second/upper orchestra section in the middle on either side of the controller area or the center of the Loggia (lower single row balcony). 

Im a music lover and an MJ fan.  The music in O was great but I think it could have been more exciting.  I honestly think I would probably enjoy the more immersive musical experience of Michael Jackson The One.  

I was about to hit submit with 3-stars rating but decided to round up realizing many readers may not realize that 3-star rating has a lot to do with value and isnt just a rating for the show itself so Ive decided to weight it on the show itself and avoid the backlash of the others drunk on the Cirque Cool-Aid."
O,"Its definitely a good show. High cirque quality.  That said, it didnt do it for me the way other cirque shows have.  Maybe I was overtired, but the water acts didnt keep me as engaged as the other cirque shows like zumanity and ova."
O,very impressed! mesmerizing show that is very different from the other cirque du soleil shows. I loved the water part &amp; especially the fire eater guy. well worth the price! I would see this one again.
O,"Okay, so there was water-that was cool. Acrobats diving, jumping, contorting their bodies to some impressive positions but synchronized swimming and acrobatic stunts Ive seen at a ringling brothers show? Seriously? Id rather keep watching this on PBS and save my time for another vegas show. 

Seriously underwhelming."
O,"There is nothing I can add that hasnt been touched on by at least one of the 625 previous reviewers.

Artistic, magical, athletic, thrilling. So cool, so weird. Loved it."
O,"I had attended O for the first time 8 years ago.  For some reason, I feel that the first time was better than this second time.  Perhaps my expectations were set too high after enjoying it so much the first time.  I think it was different than the first.

The acrobatics and diving were still stellar, but the group choreography seemed off to me.  They werent as in synch as I remember they were before.

Unfortunately, I felt I did not get my moneys worth with this Cirque performance."
O,"Breathtaking, mind numbing and unforgettable. One of the best art experiences of my life."
O,"O is the third Cirque du Soleil show Ive watched (Ka, Zumanity, O) and the most beautiful of them all. 

Pros:
- Grand aquatic stage that changes its settings constantly (from water to ground)
- Beautiful costumes and colors
- World-class divers and synchronized swimmers make very unique and interesting performance
- One of the best shows to watch in Las Vegas

Cons:
- Storyline is not as clear as other Cirque shows

Overall, absolutely amazing show. Highly recommend it!"
O,"This show was very cool.  I can say 9 great things about it for every 1 bad thing.  The high tech floor/pool was amazing and impossible to figure out.  The show and stages and set up were ALL STUNNING.  At some point they even set a guy on fire.  There are some super impressive characters and very talented dancers in this show.  This show really does have a nice mix of everything.  Its gorgeous.  I highly recommend it!

DISLIKES:

~The clown segments:  I found them to be stupid and annoying.  Too slapstick for my taste.

~ Fake audience plant that they pull on stage.  Who buys into this?

LIKES:

~EVERYTHING ELSE

~The water/stage

~The acrobatics

~Fire dancers, and playing w/fire on stage

~Costumes/Characters

~Stage/Set design (gorgeous)

~Stunts

~Athletic dancers and scuba divers etc.  Looked like some very hard work."
O,"Artistically one of the best Cirque shows. The clowns are hilarious .. great comedy relief to all the tumbling and twisting around. 

Definitely worth the price ... go see it, you wont be disappointed."
O,"What a horrific experience! The box office is a complete chaotic disaster, mismanaged and if you have the opportunity to speak with management they are so completely rude and inept that it makes the rest of the show unfortunately worthless.  If only the box office ran as beautifully as the stage performance it would be worth while.  

If you must see this show, get your tickets early (like several hours or even days as the line before the show is well over an hour and a half wait due to poor design and horrible management).  Lastly it appears they are running a scam of sorts. if you have will call tickets they can resell your tickets if you dont claim them and can do so 4 hours in advance of the show so buyer be ware and I dont think they will refund you. Oh and doesnt seem to matter if you are in the long line waiting to pick up your tickets, they will not look for you or try to pull people out that are there for the next performance, they do NOT care.  Its a shame that ugly practices like these ruin a beautiful stage. There are many shows in Vegas, this is not worth the money or the hassle."
O,"Having been to Ka, Mystere and Love, we decided on this as our next Cirque experience. It did not disappoint.

The show is a technical masterpiece. The stage morphs from a solid floor to a deep pool and to everything in between seamlessly. The show alternates from the comedic to the visually spectacular. The olympic level divers and gymnasts amaze.

We bought tickets for the top level to the side of the stage where there is only a single row of seats after reading recommendations from others and agree that this offered the best overall experience of being able to appreciate the intricate water ballet moments and all of the aerial acrobatics. You do smell the chlorine though."
O,"My first Cirque du Soleil show (Sorry Chicago folks-- The Banana Spheel did not count)! When my girlfriend proposed that we meet in Las Vegas, I told her that I wanted to watch a Cirque du Soleil show. Its a must, I told her.

I followed Misti Y.s advice-- Do not be late. The beginning amused me greatly. Like she said, it really sets the mood for the rest of the show. 

O featured acrobatic performances in and out of water. I sometimes like to think that as a Pisces, Im drawn to beautiful water shows. Im definitely glad that my friends recommended O as my first Cirque du Soleil show. I loved the synchronized swimming, the beautiful dives into the water, etc. Some of the acts certainly made my mouth form an O, out of awe and fear for the performers. It was OMG amazing! 

You have to see it! 

The music was beautiful too; I ended up buying the soundtrack immediately after watching the show."
O,"The show Is amazing, this review is regarding the unprofessional and demeaning service received by Laura at the box office today 20 June 2016.  Apparently  someone who claimed to be the supervisor on Duty who said her name is Lisa did nothing to attempt to understand the horrible service given by Laura.  Tickets had already been purchased online and all I needed was to re-print them, instead Laura decided to be very rude, did not solve the request and instead wasted our time."
O,"Its a beautiful show but not entirely worth the $185 I paid to sit in one of the first rows. It is impressive but at about half the price, Mystere is a more focused, immersive experience with more awe-inducing acrobatics. At times I felt there was too much going on and lost focus and it made me somewhat check out of the show, whereas Mystere really locks you in and keeps the viewer engaged."
O,"the parking at this casino is far away from where you want to park...lol.

O the first Cirque Du Soleil that i wanted to watch because they did a mini show on the news once.  I think it was NBC.  So i really was excited to see this.  How could you not?  It was the first circus act to perform with water, other than a guy climbing a ladder really high in the air and diving into it...hmm, pier 39 comes to mind in san francisco, I miss that show.

So about this show.  I cant tell you too much because ITS A MUST SEE!  There are so many people in this show its amazing.  I kept thinking were these people gymnasts who learned how to dive?  The thing is they have a HIGH in the air act.  They have these swings that they man themselves and gather momentum to jump into the air and perform an acrobatic move before diving into the water.  HEY!  WHERE DID THAT DIVER GO!?!?!?  HEY!  WHERE DID THAT PERSON JUST COME FROM!?!?!?!  theyve been under the water for how long?  I dont see where they came from...How big is that stage?  How long, how do they know they wont fall or drop into the water?  It must take a LOT OF PRACTICE.

Oh, that diver on that particular stunt, didnt get enough rotation and hit the water a bit flat...WOW.

OH JUST GO SEE THIS SHOW!  Its an original!"
O,"If you like amazing acrobatic entertainment then this is for you!  The entire show consists of tricks and acrobatic entertainment all performed in the water.  it was really amazing however, for $160 bucks I think Id rather have the cash.  Sorry Cirque du Soleil.  They say you have to see a Cirque sow your 1st time in Las Vegas.  Well, I did.  Been there, got the trophy suffering for close to two hours and now Im done.  I agree that you should see one of the shows maybe Love or Zoomanity might do it for ya!

Sorry but I have not pictures to post because there was a strict no camera policy.

So overall it was a good show, but I didnt appreciate it that much so thats why Im giving it 3 stars.  I can understand why others rated it higher but for me, well thats just it its not me.

Cheers and Enjoy!"
O,This show was Amazing so amazing. I plan on seeing it again. I understand now why the ticket prices are on the steep side. Worth it.
O,"Amazing, fantastic,  extraordinary, very engaging, greatest Cirque du Soleil in vegas is the O show. From the first minute till the last second just perfect."
O,"Its interesting reading all the bad reviews of this show. I just dont get it.

Ive seen nearly all the Cirque shows in the US, including the ones that tour. (The latter is probably the most disappointing of them all since youre able to do so much more with a permanent stage.) 

This is the best Cirque show Ive ever seen, hands down. Theres a reason why it gets so many rave reviews!

One of the main reasons that crops up for the bad reviews of the show on Yelp has to do with the lack of plot. If plot is something thats so drastically important to some, then go see a theater production or Cirques Ka. Personally, the reason why I wasnt a huge fan of Ka was that it followed a story *too* much, IMPO. Cirque shows are known for their THEMES not their PLOTS, and O is no different.

The show is breathtaking from beginning to end. The clowns offer some fun interludes and the costumes and theater are absolutely amazing. Cirque really used the theme of O (water) to affect every pore of this production.

If you can afford it, you have to see this show. You wont regret it. Just dont come expecting a plot and try to focus on whats going on in front of you (Cirque shows have a great deal going on in the background.)"
O,"One word: AMAZING!
Go and see it, the price of the ticket worse the show!
Noting less, nothing more!"
O,"WOW! Where to begin. . . was it just me or was everyone else dazed afterwards? Lol I couldnt for the life of me figure out what the theme of this production was, other than its a water show. There was no rhythm or reason to each of the scenes (like the scuba people), but each scene kept your eyes busy thats for sure. 

My all time favorite were the 3 contortionists and thats all Im going to say because you just have to see it to believe it! The big boat was exciting, but I dont know, I wanted more flying and swing. The music was good but the musician were in this costume above us and I think they were trying to dress like a ghost? Anyway kind of weirded me out, among other weird dead like props and costumes. If I had to pick one act to see more it would have been the clowns! They were hilarious and I loved the comic relief between all the intense acts. 

By the way even if you brought tickets outside of the splash zone you could still get drizzled on, but nothing to wear a rain coat to. Also these tickets were way more than all the other Cirque du Soleil shows, but not sure if its really worth it. It was a huge production so I understand why they had to charge as much as they did. But a lot of the acts were just extra because I only have one pair of eyes and I can only process so much at one time and it was a huge stage 8-) Not sure if I would want to see it again, but Im glad I saw it."
O,"A mid-summer night dream come true.  through the rabbit hole to your wildest fantasy, indescribably amazing ~!!!"
O,"My company had discounted front row tickets so on my last trip to Vegas a few weekends ago I definitely made use of those.  Ive been wanting to see O for several years but the shows have either been sold out or out of my price range at the time.  I was ABSOLUTELY blown away by this show.  I could have gone back the next night for another show.  This is by-far the best Cirque du Soleil show that is out there.  

Helpful hint: The first three rows are considered splash seats, because you do get a bit wet.  The lady next to me must have not gotten the memo because she grumbled the entire show about it.  You dont get soaking wet or anything but the mist from the water is inevitable because of how close you are to the stage, plus the clowns like to squirt their squirt guns haha.

If youve been on the fence about going because of money, I totally recommend the splurge - it is worth EVERY penny!"
O,"This was one of my list to do in Las vegas, MUST SEE IT
its worth watching acrobats, specially when they play in the water.

Got my tickets in front row, middle aisle, I felt every little moment each acrobat perform and see why everyone gives a 5 star with almost 300 people commenting about this show!.

I cant say much because you have to see it in person to feel it and appreciate it.  Every performance was Sensational and Love their custom outfits!

I feel like I was I as living in a bubble, with all this acrobats jumping in the water, dances, the connection in each performance was breathtaking.

a FLAWLESS SHOW!"
O,"I cant believe I havent written a review for O! So here it is:

Spoil yourself or your loved one...and go see this show! O is on a scale of its own. It was magical! Brilliant! With all of its elements: The fire, the water, the acrobats and singing. The performers have incredible talent and so does the entire production! Note the curtain pull at the beginning. It looked like a silky red rose emerging from the stage and then disappearing into thin air. There was so much going on, which made it a bit overwhelming (minus the 1 star). I wish that it was in slow motion at parts, so I could have appreciated it more. From beginning to end, I was amazed at how they would transform the stage so smoothly! 

We got Ochestra seats for about $150 each and TOTALLY worth it. Id recommend splurging for the lower level/ochestra seats because you dont want to miss anything that goes on. Beware the wet seats up close, it looked like those people needed raincoats! The theater is HUGE and very luxurious just like everything else in Bellagio. Seats were comfy! They took pics of us before the show and while we were in our seats. $45 for a set of pics in a nice album frame. My guy got suckered in and bought it for me. It was a great souvenir! Anyway, O was an unbelievable experience! I enjoyed all of it, but it didnt touch me like Ka did, which is my fav Cirque show."
O,"This was a beautiful and enchanting performance. It enhanced the nights vibe and left me feeling refreshed. Cost wise, its expensive but, its Las Vegas and, when you see the effects and detail in this show, youll fall in love. Watch out for water fairies."
O,"What an intricate, creative and talented production! I cant believe people can do half the things they did as part of this show! I loved the acrobatics and just the unimaginable talent the cast demonstrated but also the art of perfection each of them have mastered. 

I was personally a little distracted by the clowns, just not my thing, but the other stuff was cool! I totally recommend it as an experience that defines Vegas in a large part! Im just not sure Ill turn into one of their biggest fans who will see every production and/or some multiple times."
O,"Another awesome Cirque du Soleil show.  This one features acrobatic performers and water.  Im always amazed at how they can pull off all of these moves in such an elegant and choreographed way.  My hats off to the performers!

I dont want to give away too much, but this show will simply amaze you.  Its worth seeing more than once.  Theres no way I can keep my eye on everything going on.  Every time I see this show I see something different.

Definitely worth the time and money while youre in Vegas.  When out of town visitors ask me what show to see when theyre in Vegas, I mention this one as one of the Top 5 in town.

Will I return?  Cant wait for the next time!"
O,"Zumanity was great, Mystere is superb, but O is the best. Cant wait to see Ka and Love.

If you have never seen a Cirque show you havent experience Vegas. Its worth the price tag.

O,After a long 5 hour drive we were looking forward to an entertaining and relaxing evening at O- the show tired us out with too much going on. No story or guidance makes you wanting! Subtle sexual inferences makes it inappropriate for children. The number of circus acts with water are scattered and tiresome. This is why I think it deserves a 2 for the effort and energy of the actors and not for the production as a whole!
O,"I really wont say much about this show because I dont want to spoil it to anyone. Basically the most amazing Cirque du Soleil show I have ever seen. Ive seen about 3 Cirque du Soleil shows before seeing O. They all were good, but you just cant compare them to O. 

Be sure to look for 25% off coupon codes online. The best seats will probably be within the first 10 rows. If youre sitting in the first couple rows, you may get wet! ; )"
O,"On my big balling Vegas trip with my best friends dad and grandma, he definitely surprised us with super close and expensive tickets for the show. We were probably the third row or some spot really close. I love that this theater is located inside the Bellagio. 
The show itself is probably one of the best Cirque du Soleil acts ever created. The multimillion dollar theater is designed to truly highlight the performers talents. From the aerial acrobats to the shift water stage, every aspect of the show leaves you amazed. Some of the dopest scenes definitely involve the water stunts. I definitely recommend this show to anyone who asks what shows to watch in Vegas, because it truly is a spectacular and breathtaking performance."
O,"Its sort of excellent combination of Acrobatics and stage design. 

What amazed me is the design part - music, costumes, lights and cute/mute dialogues 
As to the skill part, Ive seen more complicated and difficult ones a decade ago. I appreciate the hardworking but it really doesnt surprise me at all.

I was sitting in the first row and feeling over dressed for the show at the beginning. But after seeing it, I think it worth me dress up for."
O,"All in all, I think it is worth the money and highly entertaining, even though I was falling asleep a few times.  My only real complaint is the clowns. 
A little to much going on to focus on everything because there was too much going on. For the most part, the diving is truly incredible and had me on the edge of my seat. The acrobatics were amazing and they feature some of the most beautiful ballet, acrobatics, &amp; gymnastics. Beautiful!"
O,"Sat in the 3rd row with the warning that we may get wet.

I got wet.. wet from loving the show that much! (Dirty minds LOL)

I definitely recommend this Cirque du Soleil. I was entertained every minute."
O,"Freaking amazing!  

Way over priced... but its something that you only do once.  Unless you are crazy wealthy.  The tickets we had were about $200 a piece (because the cheaper ones were sold out) , and if you dont mind sitting in the nose bleeds you can tickets for $100.  If you can afford it... I would defiantly recommend it.  

This is the 2nd Cirque Du Soleil show Ive seen... the first being Mystère at Treasure Island.  This one was even more amazing, and if you only get to see one show... make it this one!  Dont be cheep... see this show.  It is worth it!

My only complaint... that I forgot to take a camera."
O,"O, OOOO, OOOOOOHHHH MY GOSH, That is kind of how I felt when watching this awesome show, my wife and I were lucky enough to get some great special treatment and we were able to sit in the production booth and watch this show and take a backstage tour after. Now, those perks obviously added to the overall experience but without that I would say this was the most amazing show I have ever seen. First of all the theater itself was amazing and the the design of everything was simply perfection. All of the different acts hold there own level of intensity and none of them lack that O factor. From the seating we had we had a great view of the stage and how complex the entire production really is. 

I was shocked to learn that the music for the show is performed live, yeah you heard right that is not a recording. The music was spot on and keeps you licked into the show for sure. 

We have a friend that we have met through Verve and she is one of the Amazing performers in the show and after we were lucky enough to be shown around back stage by her and learn a little more about the complete awesomeness and the struggles that some of these performers go through to become a part of this awesome production. This was an extremely awesome way to spend an evening and I would go back and do it again if I ever had the chance.

I would recommend this show to anyone coming into Vegas, Not that I need to, It looked like everyone in Vegas had already decided to go considering the theater was packed."
O,"Well.. when I say I adore Cirque; I imagine it makes me a tad bit biased.  But I always find them incredibly  beautiful, amazing and colorful!!!!  All the things which are the foundation to a great anything in life I imagine.  I just saw Totem not too long ago in San Pedro, CA so I obviously enjoy their shows a great deal.  But this is not so say that I go often as the prices are a bit expensive - but I do think they could stand to lower their prices in general.  Beyond that this show was transfixing and I thoroughly enjoyed the water element and all the fabulous special effects, acrobatics and diving that went along with that."
O,"Paid $130 per person for the highest seats. Expensive and you couldnt see everything. I expected the O to be the best show of Cirque du Soleil because its in the Bellagio and its very expensive. But after seeing most of the Cirque du Soleil shows, I highly recommend going to see LeReve at the The Wynn. I got front orchestra seats for same price as the super back seats of the O and the show was WAY better!"
O,"Definitely one of the coolest shows in Las Vegas. There are clowns, acrobats, high wire acts (everything that you think of when you think of a circus) except in a weird, cool format that allows your senses to be bombarded. If you are in the front few rows, it is a splash zone but unless you are right in the front, you should be fine. I would recommend O as something you will not see anywhere else. The combination of water and air acrobatics are very cool."
O,This is the best show on the strip period. I have seen this show twice and it was amazing on both visits as I caught the nuances I missed out the first time. The submerging stage is a great achievement. All the acrobats are top notch. Maybe it was the first Cirque production I saw but it is still memorable. This is an awe inspiring production and Cirque gets all the credit they deserve for turning the entertainment industry around in the city of sin. If there was one show I would recommend in Las Vegas this one would be it.
O,"O is for Outstanding.
This is my new favorite Cirque show! There were several classic acts with an aquatic twist, as well as some new ones that you wont see anywhere else. I didnt want to miss anything so sometimes it was hard to watch everything that was going on!

O is for Originality. 
Where else are you going to see all four elements - fire, earth, water and air - utilized in one show? The amphibious costumes were unlike anything Ive ever seen before, although they kind of made everyone look androgynous. The dynamic pool-stage is just as impressive as the performers, raising and lowering the water level at will.   

O is for Oohs, Ahs and Oh-my-gahs.
There were several points in the show that I had to hold my breath. This show will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat! Just a warning, we were in the fourth row from the stage; if youre in the first few rows you will get a little wet!"
O,Everything was done beautifully! Great for all ages!!  The stage changes and acrobats keep you in awe! The clowns were a nice comedy relief.
O,"O wow, I am truly impressed with this Cirque du Soleil show. It was a theatrical masterpiece that perfectly combined the talents of world-class acrobats, synchronized swimmers, divers, clowns, and aerialists. These performers made the impossible...possible! They had no limitations as they performed in, on, and even above water. It was an amazing and breathtaking experience, as the magical stage constantly transitioned from solid ground to pool and everything in between--all in a blink of an eye!

My date and I were at the edge of our seats the entire 1.5 hours! There was just so much going on the entire time that we were excited for what was going to happen next. The only down side was that we couldnt keep track of everything. I really wish that some of the acts were separated, but that just means that the show would have been even longer. Now that I think about it...the creators actually did a perfect job of incorporating everything and if I missed anything, it will just give me a reason to go watch the show again! 

The tickets for the show were about $150/ticket. We got orchestra seats with a perfect view of the entire state. I guess you can say its pricey, but I thought it was all worth it. The show took us on a mini adventure into a surreal world and we loved it! What more can you ask for $150?! You also have to take into consideration that you are in Las Vegas and if youre willing to pay hundreds on alcohol, then you should be able to spare that much for an amazing show! I highly recommend! Performances are only held Wednesday through Sunday at two times a day: 7:30pm and 10:00pm. I know, the schedule sort of sucks (especially when you want to go clubbing), but just promise me you will make the time to check out this spectacular show!

P.S.
Cheers to my 200th review! ;D"
O,"I have been to several cirque de soleil shows, and I must say this is one of the best ones. The divers are amazing. The seating is a small theater so really any seating will give you a good view."
O,Located in the bellagio casino. Went to the 10pm show and it lasted at little over 1hr 30 min for the event. Price for me ordered through theyre website was 130 per person. There is some higher prices and lower prices if need be...I took best available at the time of ordering. There is no bad seat in the place even in the far back you can see the show with no problems. I like the event very much for a Circe show. The talent is very good. I would say its and must see show. A++
O,"What a contemporary circus is supposed to be. Cirque Du Soleil O follows the approach to circus performances that catapulted the Cirque Du Soleils name into familiar recognition. O takes the styling of synchronized diving right off old-time big screen movies and makes it a live dazzling form of art. The world-class acrobats, divers and athletes perform astounding feats of human ability, which combined magnificent costumes that reel in subtle sexuality and exoticness, produce a visual enchantment. O along with Mystere are spectacles that can only be seen, and not explained. If you are in Vegas, its a must see!

Pros: Visually spectacular
Cons: Hard to get tickets sometimes
Overall Rating: 5 of 5
Recommendation: Must See"
O,"Definitely an amazing show. Breath taking and enchanting. My absolute fave cirque production. From the water ballet to the divers...synchronized swimmers. All so amazing. The stage that turns into a pool.wow!!!! I recommend this to all..maybe not young kids who havent grown up with the arts because it is one of the slower shows.   

First time I saw it was 8 years ago and I just saw it for the third time. Absolutely amazing"
O,"I was awed from the moment I first stepped inside the O theatre at the Bellagio. The theatre resembled a European opera house, so large and beautiful. As amazed and enthralled as I was throughout the entire water-themed production, I had found myself even more dumbfounded (in a good way) when I was walking back to my hotel room and realized that no, stupid me, the performers couldnt have had access to LAND inside the pool below the stage. Meaning that after they took a plunge inside the pool they must have breathed through a regulator as they stayed invisible from the surface. You see, Im not very smart. I thought that all the crazy trapeze acts, adagio and acrobats, all the floating, russian-swinging, high-diving madness was, well, mad enough. Perhaps I just didnt have it in me to fit SCUBA complexity into my perspective of this magical show..now that just brings the entire production to a whole other dimension. On one side I am pretty disappointed that I didnt get to appreciate the circus the way it deserved to be appreciated. Although I LOVED it, it would have been even more mindblowing to enjoy all the acts I could see on the surface and being able to understand the stuff below it. Everything synchronized to perfection, moving like clockwork. To keep in mind that theres a shitload of things going on underwater and the SCUBA divers who made one appearance throughout the end of the show were probably the ones assisting the performers who needed air to breathe underwater as some of them must have stayed under more than a few minutes at a time. On the other hand, I am pretty stoked that I can see the show for the second time and be even more in awe. The performers, the set, the theatre, the music, the water, the acts...everything beautiful."
O,"I am reviewing all the Cirque Vegas shows, so I will add this paragraph comparing each one. I have seen each one twice, so I feel confident in my ranking. My ranking would be 1) Ka 2) Love 3) O 4) Mystere 5) Zumanity 6) Viva Elvis. Ka is the most technically complete, with a storyline, amazing stunts, creative images, stages rotating on axes, etc.  LOVE is the most fun and a very close second place.  O is the most beautiful. Zumanity is the sexiest, but stunts are just okay. And Viva Elvis could be sooo much better.  You can read my other reviews for more info...

As for O, it is very beautiful, some great stunts. I cant explain why, but there are moments when I was bored. I would NEVER have expected to be bored. I actually thought O would be my favorite b/c I love water shows. But some parts of it dragged on a little. Ironically, I thought Ka would be my least favorite, and it turned out to be my favorite. 

Anyway, its a great show overall. You should check it out.  Dont sit too close, or youll strain your neck. And dont sit too far away or it wont be as impressive. I recommend somewhere in the middle."
O,"The first show in my life and this was a very memorable one.  Artistic, beautiful, sophisticated, and very well orchestrated.  I wonder how much effort and time they spent to make this impressive show.  Also, it was very cool to see how they work together with water, technology, and delicate performance, making this phenomenal.  I would definitely recommend to those who visit Las Vegas."
O,"Mesmerizing. Stunning.  An absolute must-see!  It took me years to finally watch, but SO glad I did.  The view from the second level orchestra (Section 203, Row S7) was excellent.  I cant say anything about the lower level, but I think the distance and height makes for better viewing.

It blows all other Cirque du Soleil shows out of the water!"
O,"O had been on my bucket list for some time now but I always bypassed it due to the cost of tickets.   Well, it was a financial priority last trip and we made it happen - I have to say my expectations were sky high and I left pleased which I realize is difficult  when I have major expectations for something. 

We booked B tickets ($170 pp I think) and I left our seating up to my fiance... and I got kind of anxious to hear him proclaim he scored us 4th row just outside of the center A tickets (70 days out for a Friday show at 7:30).   I was convinced 4th row was just too close to enjoy the full experience based on other Cirque shows so I was a bit hesitant but it was too late to change anything up anyway.   4th row ended up being just fine -  far enough away to not be in the splash zone (there was some mist getting me a bit in one small section but it would have gotten much of the orchestra) the theater slope was steep enough so we werent too low down.  I didnt feel like I was straining to see or anything from that close.  The only bad part about our seats was the very opening act and before the curtain opened but the best viewing was likely the balcony for those brief parts.  We were close enough to see expressions which I liked and have usually missed in my standard several rows back selection process in most cirque shows.  I dont think the orchestra has any really bad seats but the balcony seemed really far away and Im not sure if it would be as good up there. 

The show itself was VERY well done.  The story lost me a bit honestly but some of reason for that was I found myself really caught up in the technical aspects of the stage and then the fact its VERY surreal.  Cirque isnt the most literal troupe but this is by far the most wtf story Ive seen to date.   I almost would like to see it again so I can focus less on the technological marvel of that stage and more on the story as maybe its the kind of story that you take in with layers.  In comparison to other Cirque shows Id say there are better stories out there (Love for example) and some crazier acrobatics in a few other show.  However,  O scores #1 on my list of all time cirque shows due to the beauty and technology in the show.

I would highly recommend this show.  There were several children in my audience around me and Im not sure its something they would have been mesmerized by and their are shows with a bit more wow for youngsters and O is a bit more subtle.  I also might pick another Cirque show if you dislike a lot of surreal and demand logical progression."
O,"O is probably The classic Cirque show, but I definitely wouldnt recommend it as your first.  I made that mistake, so I had a hard time following what was going on.  There were spectacular acrobatics being performed, but I would have fared better with something that had a more formed story line like Ka as my first show.  Nevertheless, this show was still awesome to watch."
O,"Its my favorite Cirque du Soleil show. Seen it 3 or 4 times, always greatly impressed."
O,"All I can say is that this show is absolutely breath-taking, figuratively and at one point quite literally.  Having had a backstage tour, I know of some of the secrets to the magic of the production, but even having seen the shows mechanics, it is still quite hard to believe the show is real.  

Lets take for example the theatres blue and green ceiling.  It looks like it was designed to mimic the lobby of the hotel, but in fact its lighting hitting dusty chicken wire.  Turn those lights off, and its amazing to see the difference.

As for the stage itself, its a 25-feet deep, 1.5 million gallon pool of water.  The first row is surface level, so you dont see anything underwater.  The pool has 7 hydraulic lifts (I think it was 7) that can rise to the surface without causing the slightest wake on the surface.  This is done by thousands of tiny hand-drilled holes placed systematically through the stage platform.  

Youll notice that part of the theme of O is opposites.  Within a matter of seconds the stage backdrop will go from black to white and vice-versa.  The same is said with the stage which at one moment is a pool 25 feet deep to within a matter of moments being completely dry land, all without a simple wake.  Other times some of the platforms are mere centimeters below the surface, making it appear as if the performers are walking on water.  

I do love Cirques touring shows, but there are obvious advantages to resident shows.  For instance, you cant transport a stage as elaborate as Os.  Not only does this allow for more technically amazing feats, but makes the show seem that more ethereal.

If you have seen other Cirque shows but have yet to see O, its worth it.  Absolutely worth it.  Actually, if you havent seen Cirque, this would be a great one to see.  It isnt as energetic as Ovo for instance, but it is certainly magical."
O,"WOW, completely blown away by O!! When I visited Vegas a few years ago my husband and I saw Mystere at Treasure Island and sat 1st row and really enjoyed it. On our most recent trip we decided to go with the show that everyone always recommends-O-and we were both so happy we did. We sat about 8 rows up in the center and the seats were excellent, well worth the price. The ever-changing water stage and the crazy acrobatics are so amazing, I could watch them perform for hours! In true Cirque fashion the story line is a bit eccentric (I actually had no idea what it was) but that doesnt matter because youre there for everything else. Highly, highly recommend O if youre looking to catch a show in Vegas!"
O,"Its a stage.   No its a pool.  No its a puddle.  No its an Ocean.

How do they stay under water so long?

Why arent they hitting each other as they dive-in?

I actually found clowns funny!

WTF how did they do.......everything?!

This was by far the most amazing Cirque du Soleil show I have seen to date."
O,"0 was simply outstanding.  Cirque on water...in water...above water...marevelous!  This was my second Cirque show and I loved it.  From curtain up to curtain call you become enraptured...choose the cheap sets as you will have a better overall view..trust me our front row seats gave me a crick in the neck...

...but that is my only complaint.!"
O,"I wanted to enjoy this show, I really did. But, the show was quite boring and super slow. I kept waiting for something spectacular to happen, and it never did. Eventually, I started dozing off from boredom. The only thing I remember was 2 clowns floating on a raft attempting to be funny, synchronized swimmers/divers, and a lot of water. Anyone who knows me knows I have a lot of patience. Well, I left in the middle of the act because I couldnt take it anymore from the monotonous and flat performances. Every so often youll see a few acrobats run across the stage, then a few others dive into the pool, and a few more running across the stage. That pretty much sums up the entire performance I was able to witness.

Over 700 reviews at 4.5 star rating, how could you go wrong? Boy, did I regret it. After shelling out well over $100 per ticket, I was expecting an amazing performance. I pretty much paid them to put me to sleep! If I get free tickets to this show, I wouldnt come back, nor will I give the tickets to any of my friends.

The venue was quite creative in allowing performers to transition from swimming to standing dry and back to swimming again, but that was it. The show itself is overrated and was a complete waste of time and money. I was extremely disappointed. If youre into something thats more action packed and will keep you on the edge of your seat, go watch KA. I just saw it a week ago and enjoyed every bit of it."
O,"Add a circus, subtract the animals, add the amazing swimmers  from the 2008 Olympics, add an elaborate pool, subtract sub par acrobats, add some crazy music and BAM you get the Cirque Du Soleil O show.

I missed 20 minutes of the show and they still let me in... sweet.

I didnt understand the story if there was one, but throughout the whole show I was thoroughly impressed with the show. It highlighted the possibilities of the human body and creativity. 

I want to say all the seats were good seats as the theater did not seem too big that it would disable some viewers from enjoying the show. However if affordable I would definitely sit in the front sections, definitely makes it more enjoyable."
O,"Was nothing at all like what I thought it would be. No spoilers here.

Incredible acrobatic show incorporating a lot of different elements.

You wont regret seeing this show."
O,"Listen people,

DO YOUR RESEARCH!  I can not stress this enough.  Do you sit in the front row, or even the first couple of rows when you see a movie?  No?  Then what makes you think that sitting close to a production show where there could be 2-30,40,50 preformers on stage at any given point would be a good seat?  When you buy online the computer is PROGRAMMED to assigned whatever is closest to the stage.  Best available is subjective.  Close does not =better view.  The closer you are the less of the show you are going to see.  

Yes the first three rows are wet seats.  It states that fact online when you buy your tickets.  When you pick up your tickets, your tickets themselves also have wet seats printed on them.  When you call to book over the phone directly with the hotel, the agents also inform the caller of how close the seats are and that being that close, one would in fact fall in the wet seat zone in addition to looking up during the aerial acts.  If you are unsure what type of tickets you are getting online CALL the phone number listed on bellagio.com under O.  

 O was named after the french word for water which is eau, pronounced like the letter O in the american alphabet.  It is a water based show that also encoporates ALL of the elements in it.  There is only so much room the the theater.  The pool can only be so big.  How boring would it be if EVERYTHING was done in the water.  This show is 12yrs old.  Older than most every other Cirque Du Soleil show currently out.  Other shows have copied THIS one with certian acts.  This one was the one that set the standard for the others to follow.  

Dont come to a show you know nothing about.  There are too many resources online to remain ignorant.  Check out youtube, watch some clips or trailers.  CALL an agent that sells the show tickets and get some feed back from them.  Pick their brains.  Thats what they are there for.  Never been to this show?  Have no idea what the theater is like?  Never been to a show period, in Las Vegas?  CALL a human being and talk to the agents at the call center for MGM Resorts International, they are the ones selling the tickets to you.  Theyve seen every Cirque show here in Las Vegas.  Trust me, they know what they are talking about.  FYI the box office only handles face to face reservations.  Phone reservations are done off property in a corporate office.  They are still the hotels."
O,"All I can say is WOW!!! This show was truly AMAZING! From start to finish the detail that was put into every part of it was unreal. All of the talent in the show was right on point and engaged with the audience the entire show. We were given tickets by a close friend who recommended we see it and we were completely blow away! If anyone wants to experience pretty much every emotion possible and enjoys thrills and excitement then this is the show for you! Overall, we were very please and now have a memory that will last a lifetime."
O,"O remains my all time favorite Cirque de Soleil show even after several newer shows emerged. The stage design is breathtaking. The show is well choreographed and full of energy. There were no boring acts and you will find yourself full immersed in the magical worth. This is a show worth watching more than once. If you can only see one show in Vegas, look no further. Be warned though, O might spoil your future Cirque de Soleil experience if this is the first show you see. It is simply one of their best work."
O,"Weve seen zumanity, ka, and mystere. But THIS one beats them all! You wont be disappointed!  The 1.5 hour show went by so fast because it was like a DREAM!"
O,"When the show got just started, i felt thrill from red veil and the size of stage. wonderful show it was!"
O,"Great show! The stage is wild! The music is okay... The visuals are nice, but it may not have a straight forward storyline. The clowns were a nice treat"
O,"Waste of money!!!! (*spoilers*)

I went recently on the weekend of July 4th with five other friends of mine, four of which fell asleep or dozed off.  The show starts off on a high note but goes downhill from there.  The show consists of a moving stage that was inside a pool, which was probably the only interesting part of the show.  Sadly the pool limited a lot of the feats that Cirque du Soleil is proudly known for.  The only thing they did in this show was synchronized swimming, dives, and more dives (then a few higher dives).  If I wanted to see dives, I would turn on ESPN and watch the Olympic professionals.

The story it self was very unclear and poorly told,  It supposedly a man who gets pulled into a fantasy world and sees all sorts of fanastical dancers, an animal master with a whip, a fan dancer (who was a large black male wearing the most revealing clothes I have ever seen a man wear and was personally scarring to me. Also, if I had a kid, I am sure my kid would have started to cry),  all sorts of women who is he trying to chase/get with, and all other things.  Sadly all that they get across every scene is just a bunch of people doing mediocre acrobatic tricks that I have seen over and over in Las Vegas.  And those other shows were better than O and also a s*&amp;t ton cheaper than O

I personally do not understand how this show has an average of 4.5/5 stars because if I had the option for 0 stars I would put it down in a heart beat. 

Not only were the tricks and acrobatic performances lack luster compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows, but the comic relief in between the physical feats was as bad as they get.  For one of the transitions, the two clowns stranded on a roof of a house came down to the audience and began dancing with 2 audience members in a slow dance.  This was neither funny or impressive,  this part of the show took about 15 minutes but felt like an eternity of wasted time.  In another part of the show, one of the performers grabs an audience member (who is part of the act) and forces him to climb the highest ladder in the show to perform a high dive.  This sad actor pretends to be out of shape and take about a year to climb this ladder, and also trembles the entire way.  It was very obvious from the get go that the audience member was a performer, it was plain to see for all of my friends and the people behind us.  Anyway, he ends of falling off the diving board and performing a fantastic fail of a dive.  only to climb out of the pool and rip off his shirt to show that he is a performer. My biggest problem with this part is, why did they waste 10-15 minutes of the show to have a mole climb the ladder and simple fall down and not perform a spectacular dive.  I was about to start booing at this part of the show.

This was the biggest waste of $150 I had ever spent in Las Vegas.  I would recommend gambling away your money, eating a fancy meal, or giving $150 to a hobo as a better way to spend your money and time than to watch O

After all was watched and thought about,  I would give this show O what it truly deserves, a big fat, ZERO.



worst show ever"
O,"Like many, this was my very first Cirque du Soleil production and if you go to Vegas with their numerous shows and ask for recommendations which would be the first you should see if its your only one, O is pretty much the universal answer.

Situated in the main theater of the Bellagio resort, this is one of their headliner shows going on several years now and its easy to see why.  Everything about this show, the stage, the visuals, is massive and breathtaking.  O is a primarily water based acrobatics show and I had the good fortune to get near front row tix up in the balcony level so I could see the retractable water stage from above and see how everything worked, while people down in the main floor can only see performers diving into what looks like a solid stage only to see a splash instead of a splat, and lets face it, acrobats and dancers performing in water is always cool to see.

The music is fantastic, so good I ended up buying the soundtrack CD when I left the show.  Story (as best as I can figure out) is always up for interpretation in these shows but if youre the type of person who actually likes to think while youre being entertained, you can easily picture a romantic/heroic tale involving a young man on an adventure going thru mishaps, love and laughs.  The stunts are simply amazing as well, with your standard high wire trapeeze acts coupled with stunts that beggar description.

Like most Cirque shows, tickets will start around the $100 range and are not cheap, but this is one of those shows where nobody feels they did not get their moneys worth.  Its fun for all ages with no inappropriate content for children, but is still probably best enjoyed for teens to older."
O,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show, but I had heard that this is a great show to see and I had no idea what these shows were like. I saw this show twice and I highly recommend it. 

The show, costumes, dancing and  performances were awesome. It was amazing how the dry stage was there and performers suddenly plummeted into a stage of water that appeared from nowhere. The choreography and acrobatics will leave you in awe. 

The show plays at the Bellagio.

The tickets are expensive and no half price tickets (even though the show has been running for a few years), but I highly recommend it. It is definitely worth it.  ^_^*~"
O,"This is probably my favorite Cirque show, and Ive seen a LOT of them. Its all in the water, hence the name (pun on eau, French for water).  Like many Cirque shows, the performers frequently enter and exit through the audience, and theres not a bad seat in the house, which makes the whole show feel very intimate while still epic in scope. If youre a bit of an engineering geek like me, the sheer mechanics of moving so much water in and out of tanks will amaze you, not to mention the out-of-this-world performers.

A definite must-see."
O,"This show is AMAZING! If you could only see one cirque du soleil show in vegas, this is the one you want to see. Yeah its pricey, but totally worth every penny.

I honestly cannot say anything bad about the show. The dancers, acrobats, costumes, story lines....everything was just so entertaining and fun. You will be amazed by some of the stunts they do and they surprise you every moment, never knowing what will actually happen next. 
 
GO SEE THIS SHOW!!!"
O,"Although i have no comparison to make with other Cirque shows as this was my first i thought it was spectacular. The use of water was brilliant, the routines fantastic and performers were amazing. I have never seen anything like it.


 If other reviews are anything to go by (ie there are better cirque shows) then i cant wait to see more.


 The only part i didnt like were the clowns as im not a fan generally, i went more for the acrobatics"
O,"The wonderfully poignant and heart-warming story oozing from this Cirque show, was amazing!! I cant even count the number of times I yelled BRAVO!!! lol! I felt like I was at the theater on Broadway (In NY,) watching amazing artistry and wonderful acting. I will be back for more shows God Willing! Again, BRAVO!!"
O,"Imagine the most depth defying circus acts... swinging trapezes, flipping on parallel bars and crazy gymnast routines.  

Now think about all those times you saw a gymnast take a hard fall.  That made you cringe but that memory sticks with you.  Cirque du Soleil - O brings back those memories but all the falls are into a huge pool of water.    

The massive stage pool is separated into 4 actuated platforms that can go more than 12 feet deep or 2 inches deep.  It provides an excellent walking on water effect.  But the pool can rapidly switch to 40 foot awe-struck dives !"
O,"My very fist Cirque show and I was so stunned and amazed and impressed. I couldnt believe how fast those swimmers got in and out of the water, and there were terrific dives from great heights on perilous see saws and acrobats flying through the air on metal ships in the sky, just to name a few of my favorite things. 

The performers at Cirque are absolutely the best of the best, and they go all out and the show is so worth the money. Go see it!!"
O,"An absolute must see! We took my Mom to see the show as well as our sister...and we loved it both times. The aerialists are spectacular and the water element is breathtaking. True professionals and an incredible experience for the audience. This is an especially great show to take someone to that may not be that into theatre, as it is thrilling and captivating. The use of live musicians and vocalists adds depth and emotion, as well as an awe factor, as everything in the show hinges on perfect execution from all members.

Pros: Cast, script, director, water &amp; fire elements, aerialists, live music

Cons: None!"
O,"I loved this show!!  The cast puts on a great production and keeps you entertained the entire time.  Water acrobatics are always great, and who doesnt like to see the crazy costumes Cirque shows incorporate.  Even the entrance/hallway to see the show was great...a lot of art on display.
I highly recommend seeing O, and its 50% off for locals right now...YAY!"
O,"This was my second Cirque du Soleil show, and I loved the first one I saw, but I loved this one even more! 

I knew my husband had gotten us fairly good seats somewhere in the front, but when we got there, it turned out we were front row center! AMAZING! The benefits of having prime seating didnt come cheap, but it was totally worth it (you dont go to Vegas to save money right??). All the seating in the theater seems to be pretty good though, so wherever you sit, you wont be missing out on the incredible show. 

Not only are the stunts amazing, but the makeup, costumes, sets, everything about the show is spectacular. Its mind boggling to see how everything comes together so smoothly. 

A warning though, if youre near the front and in the Splash Zone, you will definitely get wet. If not from the residual splashes as the performers dive into the pool, then from the splashes that some of the performers purposely kick on you!"
O,"This is the only Cirque du Soleil show ive ever seen, but I cant imagine one being much better than this because it was really incredible. All of the acrobatics and stunts were very impressive, and there were many moments that I remember thinking to myself, How did they do that? The music is beautiful, the water stage was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and you really feel like youre being drawn into the show. 

I probably wouldnt recommend this show for young children, they might be bored. Otherwise I think this show is good for all ages."
O,"AWESOME SHOW!

This show leaves you in awe with the amazing acrobatic acts. The show is long so you get your moneys worth. We had great seats so Im not sure how great of a view you will get if you sit in the back since the theater is fairly large. Speaking of, inside the theater itself is so beautiful up to the ceiling with the pretty colors and decor.

Theres just so much going on throughout the show, not something you would want to go if youre sleepy, or hungover from Vegas fun :)

Watch itttt!!"
O,"6/5 stars.

Of the Cirque du Soleil/Franco Dragone shows, Ive seen Mystere, Love, Zumanity, OVO, Ka, O (2x), Le Reve (2x)

My top two favorites are O and Ka. Ive recommended the two to every single person visiting Las Vegas with limited time/money.. and if they planned to watch others, those two must be enjoyed last to avoid being prematurely desensitized. All Cirques are beautiful &amp; captivating in their own way, but many of us forget how to appreciate things once weve seen/tasted/felt/heard the best.. Think of the kind of practice and endurance it requires for all Cirque performers to do this twice a day every.single.day. 

Incroyable.

Keep your eyes, ears, and nose ready for a sensational treat.


P.S. Book early, get Orchestra Center seats, around 5-15 rows from the stage. For both O and Ka, you dont want to sit too close or you may strain your neck. And dont forget to set aside time to admire the Richard MacDonald structures before you enter the theatre!

__________________________________________

If youre blessed with the time and money to watch all of the above on your next trip to Las Vegas (or if you regularly visit), Id say watch them in the following order (saving the best for last): 1.) Zumanity, 2.) Mystere 3.) Love, 4.) Ka, 5.) Le Reve, 6.) O - I havent seen Elvis or Believe, so Im not sure where they fall in line."
O,"I have been many Cirque du Soleil shows and acrobatic shows on cruise ships and theatres.  This one IS amazing and had the best staging effects!

Its one of those shows that I would only watch once if I had to pay for the tickets.  Why?  Because I would opt for the good seats each time I watch the show and the tickets are expensive!

Enjoyed the show and glad we went.  It was a great Vegas experience!  

Special notes for all the men out there -

Please be open-minded and watch it with your sweetie if she asks you to take her and you can afford the tickets.  

My girlfriend paid for her own ticket and still had to beg her man to come along with us so the pre-show almost turned into a fight when he initially refused to go.  At the end, he didnt lose any manliness after the show... :)  He also admitted he didnt fall asleep and enjoyed the show.

IMO, perhaps more guys may prefer the Cirque du Soleil Zumanity show and I agree that show is definitely a fun SEXy show to watch.  I recommend Zumanity and will rate that show in a separate review though :-)"
O,"THERES NO WAY THESE PERFORMERS ARE HUMAN !

Growing up, I watched many Cirque du Soleil productions on TV and always wanted to see one live. When my family and I went to Vegas on vacation about 10 years ago, we went to see O. Having seen some of their other works, I knew that O would be amazing.

This production far exceeded my expectations. It is incredible and unbelievable what these people can do. It was breath-taking and I enjoyed every second of it. 

Not only is the production amazing, but Bellagio is a BEAUTIFUL hotel. I would like to see other Cirque de Soleil shows when I can afford it!"
O,"This is the third Cirque show I have seen and the first time I have been disappointed.  The performers are very talented and the water effects are amazing.  However, the trapeze acts were repetitive, there was very little else happening on stage and there was very little variety.  I splurged on $184 seats and felt ripped off.  I have never spent that much on a show or concert in my life and to have the performance  be so mediocre is such a huge disappointment.  Perhaps they are resting on their laurels and dont feel they need to push the limits any more."
O,"Great talent, no story though... Too much is going on on the stage and at some point it becomes distractive to awesome tricks... If you only have time to see one show, go to KA"
O,"This has got to be the BEST Cirque show Ive seen. Ive seen quite a few of their touring shows, other Vegas shows, and the one at Disneyworld, but hands down this is the best overall. The visuals are absolutely stunning and it has definite re-watch value as there are many things going on at once.  Note: O doesnt have a substantial storyline--instead its one of Cirques more thematic shows, which in my opinion matched perfectly with the shows esthetic.

In terms of the acrobatic acts, while they are executed beautifully, they are not as daring as Cirque can be.  However, I thought all the acts complimented the show very well though. My favorite act was the diving board one.  In my opinion, best seats are in the balcony area.  That way you can see the whole stage and the synchronized swimming better.  

Overall, if you have to choose one Cirque show to see in your life, definitely see O!"
O,"Id watched CdS stuff on television before, but wow! This is incredible.

My girlfriend and I decided to see it for our 3 year anniversary. Most amazing show ever. Everything down to the way the curtains opened up will have you guessing OMG, HOW THE FCK?!..

There is a perfect blend of drama, comedy, and thrilling stunts! 

We sat at the very very very top back seats... As far up and back as you can possibly go, and to be quite honest with you, after watching the show, I honestly feel like theyre actually the best seats.. Because this show is done in a pool.. You get to see everything from the top. EVERYTHING. From ground seats, you dont see all the amazing stuff happening in the water as much. Paid 115$ each for the tickets, would pay up to 200$ to see again. Loved it!

GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!

Ps. The sculptures outside the theatre are amazing!"
O,"O-mazing?  Quite possible. 

I think part of Cirque du Soleils **WOW** factor is dependant on how frequent you see a Cirque du Soleil type show. The very first CdS I saw touring in the nineties was frakken O-MAZING!  Back in the day, a $50 ticket went a long way towards entertainment. I like to think MY PERSONAL support of the Montreal touring troupe helped pave the way to the spectacle currently in Vegas (I also invented the Man Hug and originated the saying, Play it by ear). 

Ive seen a few variations of the traveling Cirque du Soleil show, and the **WOW** factor has diminished with each show. O-MAZING  becomes O-right to only O-kay.  Im jaded to the quality of CdS because of the expectation that they will outperform last years show. However, the core of CdS is the same routine OVER and OVER: clowns, asian contortionists, trapeze artists and mood music. By the time the show Dralion toured in their familiar blue &amp; yellow tent, I thought the routine was Bo-O-ring.

However, O at the Bellagio in Vegas adds an interesting twist to the familiar routine. I dont want to take anything away from the many skilled performers, musicians and costumes, but I think the STAR of O is the ebb and flow of the moving stage that can in seconds morph from an ethereal landscape to depths of danger and excitement. Beneath the stage is a little Vegas secret. The stage is powered by hundreds of dwarves shoulder atop shoulder. But dont quote me on that. 

Cirque du Soleil tickets are a good gift to give to someone who has never seen the show. I think its also a good gift to give to yourself if you havent been over-saturated with such theatrics. You can look for discounted tickets at Showcase on the Las Vegas Blvd near MGM. 

The only thing that I didnt like about O was...

**SPOILER**

...the use of audience plants. A clown will pull an unsuspecting person from the audience (read: plant) for some onstage fun and then suddenly that person is whisked into the show and diving off 50 ft platforms! Hello liability. Gimme a break! Health care may be free in Canada, but no way does that stuff just happen in America. These French farts have used this foolery in a few Cirque du Soleil shows. The A in America doesnt stand for absent minded.

Would I go back? Gonna play it by ear."
O,"I dont know, kinda felt the pool was a little gimmicky. Of course its Cirque so the performers are amazingly talented, thats a given, and you almost feel like an uncultured twit if you dont glow over it but..... I just thought it was awkwardly constructed and left feeling it somewhere short of both a really good performance and a really good story. Glad I saw it though and probably still worth the money 

P.S. the zebra clowns suits are really creepy"
O,"Ok, so Im taking a friends Yelp approach here - No 3 stars allowed, its either a 2 or 4 star... 

I am also judging O against the other Cirques, as Ive really enjoyed all the others.  We both actually dozed off a bit during the show.  The story line, which is supposed to be a strong point of this Cirque, wasnt as evident as they would have liked.  The water acrobatics was good, and one sequence was very good.

Is it a 2 star or 4 star?  All in all, we left the theater not impressed."
O,"The O Show was spectacular. I have seen many different Cirque du Soleil shows all around the country and even in Macau, but nothing comes close to the magic of the O Show. We sat in the front row left section, which was amazing, because we saw the details of the artists gestures, expressions, and interactions on stage. It really makes the front row worth the experience. If I could, however, I highly recommend that you try to pick out the seats on the center Orchestra section about 8-12 rows from the front. This is so that you can see the entire stage in one view to watch the movements and interactions. If you are on the left or right section, your view will be biased as you will be more focused on the either section, although the performance is designed symmetrically. And being at the front, makes you too focused on the artists in front of you, more so than the group as a whole. I am not saying that it does not make a huge difference, but if I had the choice, I would choose to sit center orchestra section a few rows towards the back. 
The performance is stellar. And the design of the stage is amazing too. The way that the stage constantly turns into a pool and back to a normal stage is incredible and the way that the artists constantly move in and out of the stage/pool in perfect timing, just makes you wonder how that is even possible. There is no need for me to further discuss the beauty of the show and spoil the show by sharing the details with everyone here. But, I will share one very important piece of information with you. Perhaps, this is the most important. I suggest that you search online rigorously before you plan on buying the tickets, because I got a promotional code that Bellagio was offering online for a limited time span and got 25% off. I got the best front row orchestra seats for 25% off. Otherwise, you will be spending 150 + tax &amp; fees per ticket. The current code is Bellagio for 25% off. It changes periodically and seasonally. So, do your research!"
O,"O - my god.  This remains to be my favorite Cirque show of all time.  I truly think that if you have either never seen an Cirque de Soleil, or have seen others in the past, you need to go on to virgin airlines website next time they do a cheap airfare deal and get your ass into Vegas.  Make sure you book your tickets, as despite show has been running in Vegas since 1998 it remains a hot ticket item, that habitually sells out.  Like many things in Vegas, the ticket prices are a little bit inflated, gone are the days that the Vegas hotels sells food and entertainment at a loss to get people to come and spend their money on the casino floor.

Or do they?

I was doing more research on O and found some interesting things about the show.  

-  The costumes have a lifespan of 20 shows, with multiple costumes per performer costing about $10,000 to produce. 

-  In order for the platform stage to rise and fall without a wake, the surface of the stage has thousands of tiny holes.

-  There is an invisible wall between the pool and the audience generated by air jets; the goal is to maintain two temperature zones in the theatre. The stage is kept at a higher temperature while the audience area is kept at a lower temperature. A temperature sensor every few seats in the theatre helps ensure the audience area is maintained at the correct temperature.

-  To minimize damage to the musical instruments, the musicians and their instruments play from glass enclosures in the theater. Some of the musical instruments used in the show are more than 100 years old. The unique string instrument heard in the soundtrack of O is an erhu, a traditional Chinese bowed string instrument.

-  The show has a cast of 85 acrobats, synchronized swimmers, and divers performing in and above a 1.5 million-gallon pool. The pool is kept at 88 degrees Fahrenheit and has an underwater communication system and regulators that allow performers to breathe underwater.

They do spend quite a bit of money on this production, and like I said earlier, if you have never seen this show you have to watch it.  You have this amazing flawless mix of the moving music preformed by the orchestra and very intricately they are able to tie in some very complex synchronized acts with it.  They spared no expense on the performers, costumes, music, set design and the show itself makes the spectators feel as though they are watching something very special.  And they are."
O,"American Express came through and got us six tickets together in the orchestra to see O just after Valentines Day. We were in Vegas for a conference and the girls wanted to go to see the big O they had been hearing about.

They called and tried to get tickets a couple of weeks before ... but they could not get six tickets together.

Thank you American Express for making the impossible happen. We were very pleased with our seats and the entire experience.

Even though I had seen the show a few times over the years, I really enjoyed it again. It was fun to see it with people who had never gone before. There were lots of ooohs and ahhhhs.

I like O a lot but it is almost exactly as I have seen during my previous visits. I think it would be nice if they made a few changes from time to time so it is always fresh and awe-inspiring. 

The Cirque Du Soleil shows in Vegas are worth seeing. It is an event to add to your to do list while in Vegas, just get tickets before you leave home, or you just might miss the show."
O,"The Only good thing about The Bellagio. Seriously. This show is amazing. Youll hear it called the water one, but you better remember who told you that, because after you see the show, youre going to want to put duct tape over that persons mouth. The water one doesnt begin to do it justice. More descriptive is a visual orgy of acrobatics, dance, and design all performed on top/above/below a stage that collapses into a giant pool of water that is the foundation of the stage.

I cant tell you more, because Ill give it away, and thats rude. You wont be sorry you went, youll only be sorry if you read all the reviews and dont go.Thinking there wont be any surprises because youve seen another Cirque show? There will be. Trust me, O is not only a reason to go to the Bellagio, but to Vegas itself."
O,"Hats off to Cirque du Soleil for putting on another amazing show.  Pretty much every Cirque show Ive been able to see Ive always sat there wishing the performance would never end.

Similar to many Cirque shows there is always a storyline (if you can catch it) of a person going through many dream/fantasy worlds searching for something.  For O the underlying message was about a person finding love.  As you watch the show you can see many of the performances coupled up and they even had a scene of many bride and grooms dancing together.

Music, costumes, and performers were just amazing.  I really appreciated the art and music of the whole show.  Being that it was a water show of course there wasnt as many amazing stunts as Mystere but there were still quite a few where I was sitting at the edge of my seat holding my breath.

Another great production by Cirque.  Cant wait to catch KA the next time Im in Sin City."
O,"I fell asleep during O. 

I know, I know. Its supposed to be one of the best shows in Vegas, but I just couldnt get into it. I thought they relied too much on stage design, and very little on story and the wow factor. Overall, I thought the water element was too gimmicky, and in the end, worked against the show.

I saw Ka last winter and thought it was absolutely mind-blowing, so I was expecting O to be along the same lines in terms of production. I was really disappointed with O. 

Anyway, like some others have said, there really are few bad seats in the house. I could see the front rows and the seats along the sides of the theater having obstructed views. We were seating on the first balcony (LOGGIA, right), in the first and only row, so our view was pretty spot on.

So, if youre planning on seeing O, I would recommend checking your expectations at the door. Hopefully, you wont fall asleep too! :)"
O,Very overrated show...  Clowns were dumb and within the first 20 minutes I was going to go try to get my money back but sucked it up.  My wife hated it as well and both of us agreed going to a local circus in rapid city is better
O,"My fav C du S show so far.  
Charlton L. has indicated as our friends have in the past, that Ka is even better but that show was on vacation this week so we couldnt get tickets.  The prices are steep, but you can get them for 25% off if you purchase them on-line via Bellagio hotel.  
We got 3rd row seats but off to the right.  The music is much better than the earlier C du S shows.  Clowns are truly clowns, running up and down the aisles hassling the audience and then  performing on stage.  Costumes were colorful and the show was just great.  Its one of those shows which Id be willing to see it again.  There are SEVEN C du S shows in Las Vegas.  Theyve got a show monopoly going on!"
O,"My boyfriend and I paid $200 for our two tickets (since it was on promotion), but we sat almost center, on the second section back (which I believe was the orchestra area). My boyfriend had watched it before and told me that our seats were very good, because if you sit too close... you will have to look up for a lot of the show. You will also get wet if you are too close. Even from our seats, you can feel water mists from the stage.

Of Cirque shows, Ive seen Mystere, Zumanity, KA, and so far, this is my favorite Cirque show.  My best example of it is... Mystere on water. My boyfriend knows that I am a big fan of gymnastics, swimming/ diving, classical/ opera music, and comedy. This show had it all! 

Theres just so much going on at the same time that it can be hard to follow at some points. From costumes, gymnastics, dancing, music, diving, fire shows, theatricals, everything was amazing. The pricing is high for your typical show, but its one of the best Cirque shows I have seen.

 Some have mentioned that O is a little more traditional, and can seem to drag, but its an amazing show. If you have been to a cirque show, you know that there are always the intermission/ set change scene fillers (which are usually comical). There were two clowns who have the intermission performances who were very funny (but I think the big baby in Mystere is funnier).

I must say though that the complexity of the stage that becomes land and water w/in seconds is amazing (and is about 2 million gallon pool), to the theatricals itself, I highly recommend this show."
O,"Where else in the world can you walk by an endless row of over-zealous porn slappers on the street one minute, then be sitting in an opulent theatre watching incredible performers the next?

This was my second time watching O, and its definitely a different experience from the balcony point of view, versus the lower level. If theres a good compromise between getting a good view and saving a bit of money, try to get seats for the first row of the balcony section. Then take the money you just saved and head for the tables later.

I ordered the tickets online and got a dead-on center view of the theatre. If youre like me and are fascinated with how things work, its just a marvel watching now that incredible water set changes throughout the show -- especially from an elevated perspective. Take a glimpse on the right in the glass window where they play the live music, and watch those ladies sing and groove to the upbeat music. You almost want to get up and dance along with them.

Mystere offers some of the similar circus acts, but on far less extravagent set and tickets are far less expensive. If youre looking for storylines and a dramatic theme, check out Le Reve or KA. Utilizing the water element beautifully throughout each performance, O is a great show to watch if youre new to the world of Cirque du Soleil."
O,"This show was amazing and about as Vegas as it gets.  The amount of talent in this production is incredible.  Only critique to the show would be that the pre recorded sound effects didnt sound that great or realistic, but this show is all about the visuals so its not a big deal."
O,"It is pretty difficult to say more than has already been said by the great reviews.  I thought the show was fantastic.  The acrobatics were amazing and the incorporation of a pseudo story line kept you alert to the different areas of activity on the stage.  The diving is truly incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.

For the most part, the music was good but it gets a bit repetitive and would be better if there was something more familiar.  The choreography was remarkable and the set was unlike anything out there.  My only real complaint is the clowns.  I know that the performers have to rest and change clothes...but the clowns were boring.  It was funny the first couple times but by the end I was falling asleep during their sketches.  That needs some revamping.

All in all, I think it is worth the money and highly entertaining.  The Cirque shows are a Vegas must.  I thought Love was great and am looking forward to catching Mystere next time."
O,"WOW!!! I have been wanting to see this show, but was always hoping to find some good deals on the tix (but never happened!  this show is typically SOLD OUT!!!). Finally we decided to just buy the tix and enjoy the show!  WOW! it was really worth it!  the theatre was not very big, and we had seats in 203 section (middle upper section).. They are pretty good seats (try to at least get the middle section, i would not recommend seats on the side).  The show was just truly amazing. The water stage, the music, and the performers made every second of the show worth the price we paid for the ticket!!!   If I could see it again, i would try to even sit closer so i can see better of the facial expression and the costume of the performers!"
O,"O in my opinion is the best Cirque du Soleil performance out, (although I have not seen Love yet). It is so innovative, and just awe inspiring. If I ever were to believe in mermaids, O demonstrated how they would move in the water. The performers are just amazing, and the costumes are out of this world. Honestly, the costume designer for O is a genius. I dont even want to try and imagine how they created the stage with the changeable tank, but the water gives Cirque du Suleil a whole new level of awe inspiring magic. 
MY one and only complaint is the clown performances. I mean, why take away from such magnificence of the water acrobatics with cheap laughs? 
Clowns aside, I would go again, spend the money and get front to center tickets, this show is well worth it."
O,"Visually stunning and the amount of work, prep, and attention to detail just baffles me. Knowing that if one person is not on time with their area, then everything else is screwed. One of the guys didnt make the jump and landed in the water. He later climbed out and laid there. Good to know that not everything is perfect, and they always strive to put the best out there. The music is live which is pretty amazing!"
O,"Its good.  But I saw Ka and the non-Cirque La Reve at the Wynn a year or so ago and both surpassed this.

The storyline is so fragmented as to be nonexistent, instead more of a string of novelty numbers which is an opportunity lost.

Less use of 360* action in this theater than in Ka or La Reve, and certainly less use of the maximum theater height for the water numbers than in La Reve.

A couple of the scenes that utilize suspended apparatus for group numbers dont seem to maximize its potential.

We were in Section 102, row F.  Id suggest another 8 rows or so back to appreciate more of the big picture.  Youll still see facial expressions, and while that was mentioned by other reviewers I didnt think it was as important for this show.

In all, it is entertaining for the 90 minutes because it is Cirque (HOW do they DO that???) and they are incredible performers to watch.  BUT there are better Cirque and Cirque-like shows in Vegas.  See Ka or La Reve first."
O,"My first Cirque show in Vegas and it hurts me to give this a 3 star review but unfortunately, it didnt take my breath away.  Yes, the performances were amazing but the show overall just felt like it dragged as time went by and in many instances, lost my attention.  There was just too much going on at one time that it just made it a little difficult for me to keep up with the storyline.  Come to think of it... was there even one?  Anyhow, the costumes and the stage it self was gorgeous.  The performers... such talent.  I guess I had such high expectations for this show that I was a bit disappointed when it didnt fully captivate me.  Thought I got a deal when I saved 20% on tickets booking the 10pm show, but it turned out to be the most expensive nap I paid for when I turned over to see the husband falling asleep 10 minutes into the show."
O,"Um, WOWWWW...

Ive only seen Zumanity before O but I think O trumps all the other Cirque du Soleil shows. I still want to watch KA, Love, and Mystere but Im not sure if they can top O. We will see.

We missed the first 10 minutes of the show because my friends were late but it was still worth the $168.50 I paid for lower orchestra tickets. If youre late, they hold you at the doors until there is a pause in the show, then they escort you to your seats so DONT BE LATE...they arent Asian so they start right on time.

All in all, if youre looking for a Cirque Du Soleil show to see...you HAVE to throw down some $$ to watch O! You wont regret it. Oh and bring a light jacket too -- when the water starts splashing around, the temperature in the theatre drops so you might get a bit cold if youre sitting there in shorts and a tank top."
O,"Completely disappointing show -- I think I must be missing something, because I did not find anything spectacular, breathtaking, or dazzling about this show. Having watched Cirque Du Soleil on TV before, I knew I had to see it live when I was in Las Vegas -- let me just say that this is the first and probably last Cirque Du Soleil show that I will see. I spent $350 on two tickets very close to the stage and walked out wondering why in the hell I just wasted all that money. This isnt really anything beyond synchronized swimming and acrobatics that are glorified to the extreme. It wasnt as funny as it should be and  you wont get chills because you are so moved. I sat so close that I spent most of the time staring at the lights changing and gears/wires lifting the performers. Can you tell that Im still bitter about how disappointing this show was? 

The stage itself was truly a work of art and they made the transitions from deep ocean to surface land very seamless, but it takes a lot more than an architectural marvel to keep me entertained for that much money. Youre paying mainly to see the stage (they skimp on the gymnastics and fancy footing because of the presence of water) and lord only knows that you can see the same moves on TV and from a better vantage point."
O,"Wow. You really have to see this show to fully understand the scale of it. There was so much going on I was actually overwhelmed for the first few minutes. I mean they have everything. Live musical performers, costumes, acrobats, clowns - so what makes it different than other Cirque du Soleil shows? Well, the frogmen for one - but mainly that this is by far the most elaborate Cirque du Soleil show I have ever seen.
 
In fact, I saw Love after this and I was not nearly as impressed. O pretty much blows every other Cirque du Soleil show out of the water (ha water! get it?). So if you are planning on checking out other Cirque du Soleil performances, you may want to see those first."
O,"Amazing and worth every single penny. If you must see a show in Vegas this one is a definite. We saw this one first and than KA. KA was good as well but this show just never has a dull or slow scene. Its beautiful, fascinating, and entertaining. A must see for sure!!!!!!!"
O,We went to this for my moms birthday. It was so much fun and amazing. I had a really good time and i was amazed and excited the whole time. It was an awesome show and i cant wait to go to more. It was also pretty cheap.
O,"Sorry, but Ive seen better Cirque shows.  Could not figure out the story line - was there one?  Maybe I should have just enjoyed the acrobatics and ignored the story.  

The front of the stage is a large pool where the performers somehow jump out of to dance on the deck.  

Had a hard time enjoying this because of the stupendous cost."
O,"Impressive show with amazing acrobats, synchronized swimmers, divers and characters performances in and above water. However, there is no story and music is alright. And slow moments when I was bored. Most remarkable act was the three contortionists- magnificent!"
O,"Usage of the Gift Card is limited, and you cannot book specific seating when making reservations.  They ask you what category seating you are intersted in and some of the categories encompass more than half of the entire audiance seating... so even if you pick the best tickets its a complete gamble as to where they will place you.  Per the call attendant the box office will assign the seating and you do not know where until you get your tickets!  Its absurd because anyone placing an order with the box office will pay the same amount as you but get better seats and know where they are sitting at the time they book their tickets.

DO NOT BUY GIFT CARDS for Cirque Du Soleil - I love the company and their productions but the gift card experience was the pits!! I have $300 worth of gift cards HUGE MISTAKE-- very unhappy"
O,After hearing such  great reviews from everyone and their momma I was expecting awesomeness. Unfortunately I began dozing off  through the show even though I had a raspberry slush to keep me awake. I thought the show was going to be filled with water works with water fountain dancing. Ya not that kind of show at all. Highlights were the clowns and the fire show. At least I get to say I finally got to watch O.
O,"When purchasing tickets... my inner penny pincher almost died. It wasnt even my money!  I just thought, man this better be worth it. 
Oh, it SO was.
We went with the more expensive tickets - wanting the seats to be as good as we could get. We did have an amazing view... however - I am pretty sure we would have had a great view from wherever we sat. The theater is set up very well.
Tip: They allow you to bring your own food in. I thought that was nice since buying food in the theater can be pretty pricey. Although, everything in Vegas seems to be that way... But still - Good to know.
The show was breathtaking. I felt high off of it and I didnt for a minute want it to end. It was my first Cirque show, and all it did was make me want to see ALL of them."
O,"Pretty dull. There was no story, which might have been okay if the show didnt move so slowly and they didnt used boring clown bits to fill transition times that seemed to go on forever. The acrobatics and diving were impressive, as was the scenery, but it was confusing from beginning to end. Perhaps I am biased because I love character development etc., but they made it seem like there was a story to follow and then just never built upon it. Overpriced for what it was. Save your money. Wish we had gone to see the pet circus instead."
O,"Although it was a little pricey for the balcony seats I am glad that they were available the day of the show. These seats were nice because you could see the entire stage however the pre-show antics were missed. 
If you happen to sit in the balcony please keep this in your mind- SIT BACK! If you lean forward people behind you cant see anything. This was very annoying. 
The costumes, music, and theatrics were beautiful. This is a must if you are in Las Vegas."
O,"Masters of the Water, Air and Land. You will not be disappointed.  Olympic caliber athletes and world class performers surround and entertain you. A MUST SEE."
O,"Travelzoo &amp; SmarterVegas had this promotion for 25% off O, using the code Bellagio!  It was one of the few times I had actually seen discounted tickets for O and was enticed to book tickets for my most recent Vegas trip.

I booked 2 ish weeks before the show, and found the only several pairs of available seats to be in the Upper Orchestra or Balcony.  I figured, since Im already paying $95+ for balcony seats...why not splurge and get better Upper Orchestra seats for $20+ per ticket.  Our seats were near the back of the Upper Orchestra but we had very centered seats (bonus).  

I also found out that Cirque du Soleil releases show tickets 4 month in advance (so if you ever plan to watch another Cirque du Soleil &amp; theres incentive like discounted tickets - you should definitely hop on that wagon before seats start running out).  

The show was very audience friendly/interactive and funny.  Most of the audience gave the acrobats a standing ovation.  There was a little kid sitting behind me, laughing throughout the show [I find out at the end, he fell asleep LOL].  Exiting the theater was a hassle/mess, it was so packed!! It took forever, next time I will just sit and wait til the crowd disperses."
O,"I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS! This show is absolutely amazing! Hands down the most amazing show Ive seen. Ever!  

I got great tickets through KNPRs special night at O for Nevada NPR members.  This is totally the way to go!! All proceeds go to public radio AND I got 3rd row just off center seats (usually ~$160) for $100.  

If youre a local, and havent been, this would be a great opportunity to go (I think they do it every year in the fall).  If youre a tourist and want a great show and can afford to spend some $$$$, get the splash zone seats!"
O,"The first time I saw this show, my jaw dropped from the moment the curtain magically disappeared into the theater.  Sounds strange, but I dont know how else to describe it.  It doesnt just go up like your standard stage curtain.  So dont be late!  Performers run across the stage one minute, and then next, someone is doing a high dive into the same area.  The staging of this show is pure art.  The set design is incredible.  True to Cirque du Soleil style, the costumes are amazing.  The talent of the performers are unmatched.  The music is hypnotic.  If you were to ever buy one of the CDs, you should consider O.  We loved it so much, we actually used one of the pieces as my processional at our wedding.  When one of the performers plays a piano solo while it gently descends into the pool, that was my moment.  Sigh...   

Unfortunately, the price of the show is not cheap.  Last I checked, it went up to $150 per person.  But if youre going to splurge on a Vegas show, this one worth every penny.  The memories you will walk away with will be priceless."
O,"What a great show!

The theater is absolutely amazing as well as the performers. I really didnt know what to expect coming to this show. I just knew that there was water.. and...uh not sure what else! :)

I am very glad that I was able to come here during our trip to Vegas. We came during the 10:30 PM show and sat on the top balcony, section 303 right in the center. If you can afford it, I would recommend trying the upper orchestra seats as the balcony were nice to get a holistic view, but at times it was hard to tell the detail of the costumes/etc due to the proximity. I wont talk about the show too much just so you can experience it fully, but I will let you know that it is worth every penny. You can tell they put a LOT of time and money into it and I will guarantee you will have a good time."
O,"What a great Cirque du Soleil show. I have been to a few of these shows in New York and nothing compares to this one. 

Who would have ever thought that a production would be performed mostly in the water. You will find everything here from high dive jumpers, comedy, in water show and some dry show. 

The stage is huge and the pool must at least be 12ft deep because the high divers are jumping from at least 25ft from the pool. 

Since the theater is in the extravagant Bellagio it calls for good drinks and plenty of dining and tons of things to do before and after the show. 

I would highly recommend O for anyone that is a fan of Cirque Du Soleil and water shows."
O,"Where did they come from, and did they just dive from the ceiling! omg so beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The singing is a mixture of a romantic opera, with a bit of upbeatness. 

So I will narrow my review down of the cirque du soleil shows that I have watched in vegas, and just review o. O is bar none the most amazing experience/show I have ever witnessed, and it made me so happy to have been divirginized by this cirque du soleil show. I dont want to spoil the show, but please do try to make it to this one if you are visiting! 

If it doesnt make you just go omg, then youre kind of  a loser hahhaha"
O,"My first cirque show and it was an incredible experience.  

The water scenes, acrobatics,  its definitely one of those things youve got to do once in your life.  Tickets are expensive, but its an unique experience. 

When I went to see this performance :it was also a New Years Eve performance, and got a lovely goody bag with CD, mints. 

It was additional bonus to hear where the performers came from and to hear the performers say Happy New Year in their  own language."
O,"I dont know why I didnt really like this show. This is the first show I ever saw in Vegas, and I believe that considering the price of the ticket, along with how much fuss I ve heard about this show, my expectations might have been set to high. I was disappointed. Yes it was beautiful and eerie, yes the stage/water/pool effects are amazing, but I was bored at times ( when the clown was entertaining ), and I expected more of a wow factor. This is a beautiful show, thats eerie/dreamy, but has no stunts or amazing acrobatics. A beautifully executed circus show, on a water stage, nothing more, nothing less."
O,"Brought my girl to the show for her Bday and we thought it was amazing! The way the stage transformed, costumes, and the performances kept our attention and wondered how they can do so much in so little time between acts. A must go!"
O,"Cirque du Soleil O was OUTSTANDING. I do not like Broadway or musicals at all but i must say i was amazed by this show. The tickets were expensive, much more than i wanted to spend but I am so glad i did. The performers are amazing, the music is great the stage is awesome. If you have the chance to go to this show spend the money you will not regret it i can promise you that. Get there a half hour early, sit back relax and enjoy the show it will be one of the best parts of your Vegas trip, it was for me."
O,"I love Cirque du Soleils O. I have seen a few of their traveling ones, but this one, by far, is the best!  The very first time I saw it, I sat in the nose bleeders - way up top against the wall.  From this angle, you can see everything, from the moving stage to the scuba divers underneath.  It gives you a great overall view of the whole stage.  This experience was back in 2000 and I was just overwhelmed with it.  I knew I would one day go back again and see it.

I finally made my way back there in March of this year and sat in the second row.  From this angle, I could see the fine detailing of the costumes and makeup.  And the performers actually engage and play with the audience when youre up that close.  This was a totally different experience because although you could not appreciate the grand scheme of the show, you can really pay attention to certain performers, etc.

The next time I go, Im headed to the middle seats...I hope from there I can get a combination of the two...close enough for facial expressions, but far enough to see the grand scheme of things.  A must see show in Vegas!

And yes, I love the music!  Its great!  I like to think of O being someones nightmare (From Jennifer Lopezs The Cell kind of nightmares) and bringing it to their reality.  Theres something very costume partyish of the whole thing."
O,"This show is beautiful. Its more of an experience than a show, a living work of art. The stunts are amazing, the story is pure, the music is precise, the waterworks are brilliant,  and the journey is otherworldly. O does a great job of transplanting you into an elemental world of water and magic. Highly recommended, and also highly expensive.

If you do get the chance to see this show, please do. Its such an adventure and youre just in your seats."
O,"My favorite Cirque by far!  We sat  2nd row, right orchestra and we had an amazing view!  They were wet seats, but we really didnt get wet at all.  You can feel a mist, but it wasnt severe.  Just dont make eye contact with the clowns, otherwise you may end up getting wet after all. :)  This is a larger theatre, so closer is definitely better.  Well worth every penny! If you appreciate Cirque, you will love this!"
O,"Just memorizing... the Bellagio is already an amazing hotel, so their theater is nothing short of spectacular. One of the more expensive shows around but the production is the best quality! It leaves you scratching your head asking howd they do that? Haha. I will say unlike zumanity that kept my attention, o does have some slow parts to it but its still an amazing show."
O,"Before seeing O, I was fortunate enough to see Believe as well.  Two Cirque shows in the same night was quite a treat.  I had high expectations for this show and low expectations for Believe; such expectations can come back to haunt you, both good and bad.

For O, I was, in the end, dissapointed.  I loved the show overall, the acrobatics, the enormous stage and the comedy performed on stage (or in water).  It was a great show. 

There were very impressive scenes and costumes, but the lack of any sort of plot bothered me (and reduced the star).  I guess the plot could be that of reading a childrens storybook.  There is one reference to the cow jumping over the moon that comes out of no where.  And thats just it: stuff comes out of nowhere and while visually stunning and entertaining, never ties into the next scene.  Criss Angels Believe, while inferior but not really comparable to O, did have an overall plot that was difficult but followable.

But who am I to judge.  This show has been here for a long time and sells out every night, right?  I was lucky enough, again, to sit only 15 rows up and dead center.  Would I pay to see this again (about $160 a pop)? No.  If I paid anything cheaper Id be in the balcony and not get the same experience.  However good a show is, if I can enjoy it just as much in the back as I could in the front, that is my idea of a 5 star show."
O,"Spellbinding.  The engineering that went into the creation of that stage is nothing short of genius.  Loved all of it, even though it did cost me $150.  No matter--front row seats, would have paid more.  

Everyone tells me that after having seen this one first, all other Cirque shows will fall short.  Oh well.  Maybe Ill just see this one over (and over...and over) again!

Not to be missed."
O,"YES!!!! Omgomgomg I LOVE it!!!!!
Acrobatics, diving, ballet! All very artsy, very extreme, cool music and the stage setup consistently blew my mind!!!! My interest was peaked 80% of the time. 
The story was a lil avant guard minimalist but was still diverting. 
I would give it 10 stars if i could!!

Trans Friendly- meeeeeh the only time you deal with the public is in line, some faux snobs may be wierd but cmon its theatre theyre used to seeing stuff"
O,"I bought tickets by calling them, and found that it was better than buying online tickets because you can be really specific about where you want to be seated and ask them for their personal advice (though one of the ladies that worked there was absolutely rude).

Anyway, the show was amazing and the stage is incredible.  I have to say that despite all the hype and how everyone says its the best Cirque du Soleil show.... I cant agree for some reason... Ive also watched Alegria and Corteo."
O,Unfortunately I was not impressed with O. It was my first Cirque show and I opted to go with the best seats at $125/ticket. Granted the stage was technologically advanced. But the story was hard to follow and the performances didnt flow easily. I think I might have even dozed off somewhere in the middle for a minute.
O,"Never been to a Cirque show before and after much reviewing and friend influences to go see these shows - we reviewed o, got the most expensive seats and really looked forward to it... 

VERY DISAPPOINTED... lots of non-sense... randomness... no story line (and that could be my fault for expecting a story), stunts/acrobatics... blah, nothing out of this world... u see better stuff on TV. Water acrobatics? Please... bunch of people diving in and out of a water with cute costumes... and that is really it - lots of eye-candy... nice costumes and that is all... music was terrible... not my taste at all... was expecting something more eclectic/operatic.... very pop-Hindi cookie cutter compositions. 

What saved the show? The clown interludes were real funny... real cute... and well done. 

In a nutshell... I am a very open-minded person, cultured and artsy and really anything goes but this show inspires nothing. I went to this particular show because it had the best ratings everywhere I looked. But still, I dont regret not going - at least I know what they are about (will never pay to see another one). If you are unsure - trust me, get the cheap seats - at least you can say youve done a show. But expect no storyline, sub par acrobatics/stunts, lots of non-sense movement and sequences... very long, and emotionless. 

People next to me were oohing and aahing - I cant understand why - if you are easily amused, think germans cars are better then japanese cars, have and ipod but use a pc, use ShutterFly instead of Flickr, or use Hotmail/Yahoo instead of Gmail - then you will like it - if not, you know there are better things out there. Hope this helps... I could have used a young, urban, real-rating to this show."
O,Went to see this show on Valentines Day 2 years ago! It was definitely AMAZING!  I have been to the Cirque du Soleil in Orlando (La Nouba) and this definitely blows that one out of the water.    It blends comedy and drama with amazing acrobatics and it truly amazes.  Definitely a show to see when in Vegas.
O,"I am by no means an expert on Cirque du Soleil, this was only my second time seeing a show.  But wow, what an awesome show!  Unbelievable stage design, almost seamless stage transitions, great music &amp; sound system, creative costumes, lighting, and amazing acrobatics.

I was captivated form start to finish, loved the whole thing."
O,"This was a hard review.  This is the second Cirque du Soleil show Ive gone to.  The first was Kooza which I believe I gave 3 stars to.  Now, this being the most popular CdS show, I was expecting a lot.

Firstly, the theater was huge.  We were on one of the back seats in the middle and we could see the stage perfectly.  It was only in the beginning where they had two clowns walking around the audience in the front rows where I couldnt see.  But that wasnt part of the show, so its OK.

The show was good and bad.  Some parts were better than Kooza, some were not.  Lets begin with what I felt was not as good as Kooza.

In a circus show, you expect stunts that are unbelievable and not humanly possible.  Well, the stunts and acts were not as amazing as Kooza.  They also had some of the same things.  There were the overly and freakishly flexible chicks that were just bending into each other like pretzels.  So Ive seen that before.  But this show also had some cool water stunts, as well as a larger stage.

What they did better was what I think was the main objective of the show.  It was beautiful.  Wildy creative and sometimes just jaw dropping beautiful.  It really reminded me of a crazy dream you have.  Even the comedy sketches with the clowns was just insanely beautiful.  I dont want to give examples and ruin anything, but yeah... just beautiful.  

So this is why it was so hard to review.  My gf said she preferred Kooza.  I feel O was the better show just because of what their objective was."
O,"The show was amazing. We had third row balcony ticket. At the beginning of the show when they are doing stuff in the crowded, you pretty much cant see anything unless you are in the first row of the balcony or in the lower sections. After that when the show really starts nothing blocks your view of the show (unless you have a very very tall person in front of you).

The show is amazing, worth seeing it again."
O,"O is very impressive.  The acrobatic acts they perform can be found in other cirque type shows but presentation of all that is what makes it cool.  
What impressed me the most was the stage.  The stage transforms from water to solid ground which I think is a technical achievement in itself.  
I dont want to spoil any surprises... but let me say I was in awe from the moment the curtain lifted.

TIP: while front row seats sound good, with a show with so much going on (and a splsh zone), I recommend getting seats a couple of rows back."
O,"Amazing and very different from other Cirque shows.

I would definitely recommend sitting in the first row. You do get wet but you can see so much when sitting closer!"
O,"Pretty darn cool. The things some people can do are amazing. How do you bend like that?? How do you jump so high?! How are you NOT dizzy?? 

O has water, acrobatics, a whole bunch of stuff. The music is moving and the choreography is intricate. Its a great experience if you havent seen production show... but its always booked up so try to get tickets asap :)"
O,"*my very First Broadway show was watching O.
*very expensive at ~$125+ for my seat near the front middle row, but it is Definitely worth it!
*Expect to be entertained by gymnasts, acrobats, fire jugglers, contortionists, etc.
*Be mesmerized by the stage lights and decor.
*Those clowns in the beginning of the show... watch them wander into the seats sections messing with pple before the show starts!
*I got their CD after the show :)
*O triggered my love for Broadway and non-Broadway shows.
*Im a fan of anything by Cirque du Soleil!"
O,"Ive seen 3 other cirque shows (Love, KA, and O), and this is one of the very best. I honestly cant remember if there was a storyline, but Ive gone to cirques where there WAS a discernable storyline that bored me to tears (Im looking at you, KA). The entire time, your mouth is dropped open from the amazing things the acrobats are doing. The stage is incredibly unique - it goes from a pool of water to completely dry in seconds flat. I also liked the clowns. They were funny and endearing. It was also cool that the music of O was being played live. The whole show was sensory overload!

I cant more highly recommend this show. I cant wait to see it again myself!"
O,"O.. was OMG.. I loved every minute. I couldnt focus on one place on the stage, its one of those that you can definitely see twice..

Book seats on the balcony so you can see whats going on with the stage and the water.. from a lower level you dont see how amazing everything is."
O,"This is my first yelp review, but I felt so passionately that this show is a waste of money that I felt the need to share my thoughts. I am not one of those people that are difficult to please, or a debbie downer all the time.

I have seen almost every cirque show in Vegas. Zumanity (twice), La Reve (twice), Love, and now O. I like Cirque shows. However, all the hype led to higher expectations than what you actually see in O. I was very impressed with the guy on fire (he burns throughout an entire scene)--but other than that, La Reve was much more impressive. 

La Reve has a much more intimate theater, no seat is poor. At O, the theater is jam packed and the seats uncomfortable. I was bored and very  uncomfortable the whole show!

The clowns werent funny, and were on stage for way too long. I would have been happier if the clown scenes were shorter, making the entire show a bit shorter. 

Our tickets were 25% off, still 393 for three people (after taxes and fees), at some of the best seats in the house. Row K, seats in the center, right on the edge of the middle section. Not worth it at all. I would not pay twenty bucks to see this again.

Like all cirque shows, there wasnt really a theme... which usually doesnt bother me, but this one flowed even more awkwardly than the rest.  I recommend La Reve. It is passionate, and remarkably entertaining, although no true theme, I was able to connect with it. I had no emotional connection with O... Kind of just made me feel like I was having a bad dream... or hallucinating? Not good. Definitely too scary for kids, dont bring em."
O,Fell short of expectation for the price I paid. The acrobats were great but I did not catch the theme of the show.
O,"I had extremely high expectation for this show and they were partly met.  I have seen many cirque shows in the past.  We had wonderful seats and this is always helpful.  We were second row center.  Overall, worth seeing if you have the time.

Pros:
Most unique and amazing stage I have ever seen.
Amazing high dives.
Original fire dancers.
Cool contortionists (though have seen better)

Cons:
Stupid clowns.  Cirque: do some market research.  The clowns are never funny and, in this show, totally annoying.
The show was actually shorter than I expected.  One act.
The action was quite scattered around the stage with certain unimpressive displays distracting from the main act."
O,"I initially hesitated about buying tickets to O due to the high price, but having seen the show, I dont regret one dollar of what I spent.  This is a 90 minute show without an intermission, and with a couple of exceptions, it is non-stop action.

The best thing about this show is the number of things that are going on at the same time - most times I didnt even know where to look.  The set design, which can change from solid land to deep water in seconds, will shock you.  The performers, all amazing athletes, deliver a phenomenal show (and they are quite nice to look at too, I might add).  The only down-side to the show, which for me brought it from a 5* to a 4*, was a couple of the appearances by the clowns, which at one point did have me checking my watch.  Sorry clowns."
O,"This is my first Cirque de Solei show and I gotta say it was AMAZING! Everything about it from the performers to the stage art to the execution of everything, it was AWESOME.The stage art was so beautiful I cant even explain it. Whoever choreographed it and came up with the design behind every single set is a GENIUS. There was so much going on that I had no idea what to focus my eyes on. I mean, theres always a main performance but theres so many side performances in the back and sides that my eyes got so dizzy looking everywhere haha

The show runs around a little over 1 1/2 hours. 

I have nothing to compare this to but this is a DEFINITE recommend for the show. I mean, based on the ratings alone, I know Im not the only one who thinks so."
O,"Simply amazing.

The stage is absolutely unique. The intricate routines and transitions between land and water are so spectacular, itll leave you completely awestruck.

There are just too many good things about the show to go into depth about, so I wont. Just watch the damn thing.

You must pick-up tickets at least an hour before the show starts, or your tickets will go back on sale without a refund. Yes, what a burn that would be.

I really dont understand the less than 5 star reviews. You must be an trapeze artist yourself not to think this show was anything short of stellar (or a flying squirrel)."
O,"I went into this show with incredibly high expectations because I had heard so much hype. I have previously seen Mystere and as amazing as that show is, it really can not be compared to O. This show is beyond what you can imagine and beyond any Cirque Du Soleil you may have seen on tv. Usually, when I have such high hopes I am disappointed but instead, I was still blown away as it was beyond even my wildest dreams. 

The show is set on this giant pool where the floor comes up to an inch of water to so deep you have divers jumping at least 5 stories into a small pool of water. Without giving a lot away, Ill end this by saying you owe it to yourself to see this show. Yes, its the most expensive Cirque show in Vegas at around $150 a ticket but trust me, its worth every penny and then some. Its so impressive, Id go again."
O,"AMAZING! Extremely over stimulating though. I felt as if I needed about five different brains to take all the commotion in! 
There was everything going on and let me tell you not once did I feel the slightest bit un-entertained! You must go! 
Contortionists kind of scared me but other than that the diving and the big black guy in a thong. Too great not to experience! Definitely splurge and get front row seats, I feel as if the nose bleeds would not be as effective."
O,"Amazing show... I was able to see it from the booth due to a friend getting us tickets... and even with all of the cues and such being called... there are still some things that I just do not know how they worked themselves out. 

Heck, we even got a tour backstage afterwards (got to play the metal piano, etc), and was still amazed by the show. 

The flexibility and dexterity of the Cirque Troupe is just amazing. See any of their shows and you will walk away thinking the same thing... but go to this one just to see the stage."
O,"Surprised my girlfriend on this las vegas vacay with row D seats in section 103 (right in the center).  I came in to the show a bit tired and I had feared that our row D seats were closer than I had wanted them but I just sat and crossed my fingers.  The clowns were a bit boring as the opening act but it was a great way to keep the audience entertained and to get the audience familiar with their characters for their following appearances.  The show began and it was AMAZING, the greatest show ever created.  It was as if the show had been created by the hands of god!  The clowns reappear in the show twice and I just loved their characters!  People question the existence of the clowns in the show, but its to give the acrobats a break!!  But yes, definitely a must see in vegas"
O,"We were so impressed with KA, we decided to splurge for another show. Since we were staying at the Bellagio we picked O.  UGH - what the heck.

Now, the performers were brilliant...but
I felt as though I was on a date with the stranger next to me the seats were so smooshed. 
The storyline was so out there it was impossible to follow.  And I am pretty good at picking up abstract concepts.  If someone had just told me that it was a circus show, dont look for a story line, I think I might have enjoyed it better.  But you could tell they were trying to tell some sort of story...what the hell was up with the lady in the red dress??  She scared me.

Definitely will not be spending the $250 to go back to that show
Probably would have been better if the clown guys were on the whole time - loved them"
O,"You read all the reviews and you ask yourself, is this really one of the best shows ever? 

Yes, it is. Go see it. Spend the money. You wont regret it. 

I am evangelical about my O recommendation - I tell everyone who goes to LV to watch O. A circus in water... intriguing at first. Then when you see it, youll absolutely be speechless."
O,"Awesome! This was my 3rd Cirque show (after Mystere and KA) and though quite hesitant at first to shell out what amounted to the price of admission for the other two shows combined, I left feeling that it was quite worth it.

A water-based show, it was a refreshing break from the hot Vegas weather outside. We snagged very decent seats (they have deals ranging from 15-30% off from time to time if you join the Bellagio Club on their website) and were thoroughly entertained from start to finish. This show really tests your perceptive ability as there are literally dozens of things going on at the same time. It also makes you question your own physical ability and makes you feel totally inadequate :D The show artfully blends comic relief with amazing feats performed by obviously talented acrobats. The pool/transforming stage is pretty neat - one minute its a pool deep enough for something like a 40-50 foot dive, the next its a regular platform that people run across. 

Watch out for the trolling clowns before the show - youll know what I mean when you go :]"
O,"Had Limited View tickets which were close to the action, but now I need to get center stage further back tickets and see it again...worth every penny I seeing this show while in Vegas!"
O,"Alright so here goes this review which I never expected it to be a poor one especially that I waited so much to see this show to be disappointed.  I went with my fiancé last night and I must say even though all they perform which are the divers and the acrobatics is beautiful,  it was very hard to keep up with so many things going on at the same time. I have seen other cirque du soleil shows and they were great,  but this one just clearly had me confused that at a point I almost was falling asleep since it actually became boring when some clowns came out which to me didnt make any sense, they werent really funny at all. Sorry to the people whom believe that this show is amazing, I truly had high expectations and was very disappointed.  The concierge at my hotel was right,  this show was not worth the over priced fee that you will pay, and yes it lasts an hour and a half approximately and starts exactly on time. If you come to Vegas skip this show and see others, this one is not worth it at all. Like I said this is my opinion and people are entitled to choose what they desire,  I just wanted to inform of how the storyline was not clear at all and for that reason I didnt enjoy this show."
O,"First off, Id like to thank all the previous Yelp reviews for alerting me to the fact that by mentioning the word Bellagio when booking by phone I get an instant 25% off. BINGO!

As far as seating goes, the past reviews were mixed in opinions, which only lead to massive confusion and indecisiveness. But after calling in to the box office 3 times and asking friends I felt I was able to make a sound decision. Sure enough, I couldnt have been more happy with my seating choice and so Id like to offer my...

OFFICIAL SEATING BREAKDOWN:

- Back of section 103 is pretty much unanimously voted the best seats of the house. But apparently these seats are incredibly hard to get - either reserved for VIP guests or you have to book early.
- Sitting in the first few rows is still at the highest price tier, but is going to be a total neck strain as youre trying to catch all the action of the entire stage.
- I sat on the balcony in section 303. The first row of the balcony hovers over row S in section 203, so it was not as far back as I had first imagined. First row of balcony has a railing and security does not allow you to lean forward. I would opt for the second row (where I sat) as center as possible, even though the entire section is centered and decent. Honestly, I thought the balcony had great seats. You were able to see everything that was going on for a great price. A few reviews mentioned how the scuba divers were distracting, but I thought it was interesting to see how the mechanics of the pool worked.
- If you cant get the best seats of the house, save some money and sit in section 303.

And as for the show.... I dont think theres much I can say that you dont know already. Theres a reason why O is so popular, and thats because its absolutely mind-blowing. Play close attention to the red curtains at the beginning. The reveal was breathtaking. If youre a Cirque du Soleil virgin (like I was), this is definitely a great one to start with!"
O,"This is yet another great Cirque show in Las Vegas!  This one, located in the lovely Bellagio, is a must-see for any Cirque fan.  I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option, and I think this is a 5-star experience for most visitors.  

Why wont I give it 5 stars you ask?  Simply put, because it didnt blow me away.  It was fantastic, but maybe I expected too much?  Maybe I wasnt in a 5-star mood that night?  I dont know, but I can tell you that when I think back on that night, nothing from the show stands out...except maybe the guy that squawks like a bird and flops around on the floor.  He was memorable.

Anyway, see the show.  It is great.  I might go back one day to see if it is better the 2nd time around.  You certainly wont be disappointed."
O,"We sat front row and that was pretty awesome to be that close.  I found a deal online, so we didnt pay a crazy amount for such great seats.  The show was really cool and really interesting.  I am not entirely sure what I saw but I loved the dives in the water and the way the stage raises and lowers is pretty awesome.  I think it is a must see."
O,"The show was amazing!  Their are multiple moments when performers come out into the lower audience area.  Its actually better to have seats up higher because that way you have a view all the cool stage changes they do from water to solid floor.  Youll be blown away by that, and you dont have to strain your neck from looking up, because a lot of things happen up high too.  Most definitely worth the money.  Only negative,  as someone else said, the story line was kind of hard to follow."
O,"I would have paid $300 (roughly double my ticket price) to turn right around and see it again.  Words cannot describe.

I always see Cirque clips online or on late night shows but they dont compare to the actual show.  I thought Id be underwhealmed but boy was I way off!  

My seat was about 3rd row center stage.  Amazing.  Doesnt seem to be a bad seat in the house, though being that close made you feel a part of the show.

EFFING AMAZING!

Im hooked on Cirque shows now!"
O,"Amazing show, worth every penny! It was like a bizarre dream world, with amazing costumes &amp; choreography, not to mention amazing feats of strength &amp; ability by all of the cast members. The stage was incredible, the theatre is gorgeous, amazing!"
O,"quite the ticket price, but hey, were in vegas baby!! My wife was looking forward to this show before we left Seattle, so hey, whatever makes the wife happy right?? Well, lets just say, I think I had more fun at the show than her (not that she didnt have fun) but I was BLOWN OUT THE WATER (no pun intended). Great show, sheer brilliance and talent at its finest! It is quite a steep ticket price to pay, but believe me, it is definitely worth it!"
O,"Im only giving this a 3 stars because I liked my seat... as for the show, it is jus a lil weird for me... the ppl on the show are very talented with wat they do and how flexible they are but there was like no talking or singin and i got bored with it."
O,"I normally wouldnt give such a low score, but it is sadly deserved in this case. Ive gone to a couple of Cirque du Soleil shows in the past, and none were as badly executed as this one. 

Generally speaking, I purchase the best seats in the house when it comes to watching shows (unless its comedy, you dont need a perfect view to enjoy funny- for the most part, at least). I paid $165 for Orchestra seats, which are the best seats in the house. I expect that from my vantage point, Id get to see everything, which I pretty much did, however, what I didnt expect to see was the numerous and blatant mistakes made by the cast of the O show. My friends and I flew into Vegas and with a flight out of SFO that was delayed 3x, we were stressed that we wouldnt make the pick up time for tickets. Via calling in advance to hold our tickets after explaining our situation, we missed the first 10 minutes of the show, but was able to see most of it. It was one of the girls first time watching a show. She was all excited and at the end, quite disappointed. The only question she could ask was, were there supposed to be that many mistakes? Yes, there was a missed connection on a swinging catch (the person dropped into the water), there was a girl who was thrown, but not caught (she sadly did not only hit the water, but a part of the stage floor), there were dropped fire patons, dropped props, etc. Although mistakes are expected on occasion, I didnt expect to see so damn many. And its not even a traveling show! Its one in which their stage is ALWAYS the same and one that has been running for quite some time now. 

Needless to say, I felt a little ripped off at the end of the night. Overall, the concepts, costumes and theatrics were great. The execution was poor and I was sorely disappointed. :( Ive heard from others that the show was mistake free so maybe we just went on an off night?

I would have given the show 3 stars, but the ticket checker was a bit rude."
O,"Amazing show!! Absolutely loved it!

The water stage was mesmerizing, as it transformed smoothly from one act to another, while acrobats, synchronized swimmers and divers performed in and above the water stage.  The set was lavish, costumes and special effects were mind blowing and breathtaking...dramatic, yet with a touch of humor here and there.  

Watching the show was like a shot of adrenaline...your energy is up throughout the entire performance; the music and talented performers keep the show interesting and puts you on the edge of your seat!

We had seats in the balcony, which wasnt a problem at all.  We got a birds eye view of the entire stage. Plus, sitting up in the balcony prevents you from getting wet from the water stage. Now I cant wait to see the other Cirque de Soleil performances!"
O,"Its hard to call O a show.  I like to think of it as little dreamy vignettes.

Last night was my second sitting at O at the Bellagio.  And it really is dreamy. (honestly it was so friggin hot in there i fell asleep....twice.)

My fav of the Cirque shows is still Ka, but, O  has so many fantastic technical moments, its hard to keep ones jaw shut.

From curtain up, which I mean literally.  The huge red curtain flies up and into the back of the stage reveling a performance space that almost mirrors the size of the seating arena in size. Like most Cirque experiences theres not real plot, but a through character that we are meant to identify with as he stumbles through the adventures of diving acrobats and flying horses.  

Its charming and worth the ticket.  The hard part about coming to Vegas is really picking which Cirque show you wanna see.  ( believe me there are plenty to choose form and more on the way) But, O is a solid choice, if not just for the fact that the stage transforms from lake to solid ground every 3 minutes."
O,"This show is by far my favorite Cirque du Soleil show (Ive seen at least 7 to date).

Orchestrating: First, I the planning, timing, and full affects the show is able to achieve amazes me. The staging is excellent. I cannot think of a better show (Cirque or not) that Ive seen with better timing and affects. In particular, I was watching very closely the moving water/pool and the timing between the stage switches and I cannot find a single flaw.

Versatility: Second, the show had an amazing cast who was pretty versatile in terms of their skill set. Divers and synchronize swimmers coordinated well, but they werent simply completing their main skill. They also included dance and theatrical elements. The talent of the cast is well balanced and their varying skill set was utilized well.

Nice Seating: Third, the seating generally is excellent for the show. I had 7th row center seats when i watched this show, but the seating area isnt huge so even folks farther away could see fairly close. 

Aesthetically Wowing: Fourth, the show was stunning and beautiful. Unique costumes and the stages were beautiful. The pool was creatively crafted and works well with the stage. The props flowed well with the show and they complemented the acts yet the main focus was on the cast and the props did not take over their fame.

Perhaps, the only down is that the tickets are not cheap and Ive yet to see them on the half price ticketing booths. 

Tip: When I tried to get tickets first, the seats were lousy online especially for the price paid. I went ahead and just risked it and went to Vegas without seats. I talked to the hotel and ticketing box office and found out that they release vip tickets with excellent seating around 3 hours before the show. I barely waited in line and was able to get 7th row, center seats on a weekend night showing for $175.00 a piece (not cheap, but pretty much what you would pay for center/near front seating). However, using the day of purchasing method, I ended up with better seats than I would have received had I bought ahead of time online. Also, some folks might forfeit their seats or not show up so new seats open up few hours before the showing."
O,"This contemporary, artistically interpreted circus is mind-blowing.  But thats putting it too simply.  When you sit there, your eyes are darting every which way, hoping to capture everything that is going on stage.

The performances are top notch, from the synchronized swimming to the difficult gymnastic moves.  You cant help but admire the performers for their flexibility and utter strength.  There are touches of erotica from the lithe movements of the dancers to humor with the two wayward clowns.

The stage is really...AWESOME!  One moments, the wooden boards slide to complete a stage for dancers to get on.  The next moment, wooden boards are sliding every which way to reveal a pool for divers and synchronized swimmers.  The transitions are flawless!

I cant really tell you about how beautiful, wonderful, awe-inspiring the show is.  Once you get there, you cannot help but become mesmerized.  This is def one of the best shows Ive ever seen."
O,"Cirque du Soleils O is located in its home theater at the Bellagio Hotel. This is Cirques water show, with diving, gymnastics, acrobatics and dancing. It has their signature comedy act and the bald headed strong man, as well. The amazing feats these athletes are capable of, yet displaying grace and beauty makes it all quite impressive. A bit costly, but well worth it."
O,"Besides the weird crying(?) clown, it was an amazing show.  The seating location had a lot to do with it.  Perfect center, middle stage.  The illusions were perfect and the performances had no flaws.  Considering how many there are, thats simply amazing.
As always, impeccable and beautiful music!
O is great!  
I would recommend it for any evening event when in Vegas!!!
Its also an excellent event to do with family."
O,"I absolutely love The O Show. I heard great reviews about it for years but was never actually able to catch a show due to the limited time spent in Vegas (2-3 nights max).  This time I was determined to see this show. We got VIP seats, 4th row. Amazing spot. The show is brilliant. It starts out with clown comedy then boom action packed, comedy filled, thrilling, riveting, water splashing amazement. I highly recommend this show. The water and rain portion of the show was my favorite."
O,"The wife and I decided to splurge on tickets for this production. We sat up at the very front where we could get the best O experience. For the most part, we were not disappointed - amazing stage, awesome stunts, great overall production. But the whole thing seemed like a bad acid trip. Now - Ive never done hard drugs, but if I ever did, this is probably what I would see - clowns, water, fire, strange people flipping and flying all over the goddamned place, etc. Im sure there was a story or a point somewhere hidden in all of the extravaganza, but I really am not sure if I understood any of it.

Oh well - lots of cool stunts, neat and very unusual imagery, and a transforming stage combine into a very enjoyable experience. Im probably not refined/smart enough to appreciate or understand the complete package. Still fun for the most part though."
O,"OOOOOOMG!!..(OOook bad joke)..but this show was CRAZY!!!...Definitely the best show Ive seen in ages. Not sure if this is weird, but now the first thing I think about when I think about Vegas is this show...Highly recommend when ever youre in Vegas."
O,"Beautiful chaos!   It was spectacular. There were a couple moments where I felt there was too much going on because I couldnt look at everything.  We had great seats. Section 102, row N, seats 14 &amp; 15.  The stunts, acribats, costumes, music, its all wonderful!   Getting the audience involved, runnning through the audience,  and swinging into the audience. Just a breathtaking performance by all.  The amount of work that goes in backstage, and under water in this case, must be amazing.  Looks like a great group of people working here. The show is almost two hours but seems like only a few minutes. You are mesmerized the entire time. There are floor changes before you even know whats happening. Characters pop up out of nowhere. My favorite may have been the diving group. It was fun, upbeat, and daring. I think there is probably a uniqueness to each time this show is performed. I would love to see it again and catch the differences. A must see at some point while coming to Vegas.  A tip:  get seats more towards the middle. If you go too far to the sides you dont get to see it in its entirety. If you go too far up you lose details (and theres tons).  If you go too far down you may get wet!  We paid in the 180 each range but it was worth it."
O,"I guess I had high hopes for it, being my first Cirque show but it was actually kind of boring after a while... I guess I was expecting more stuff to go on but all they had was swimming and diving which was interesting but not as cool as a lot of commercials i have seen for other cirque shows.

It was good just not great."
O,"Our first show in Vegas.  it was great!  Amazing stage!! Great colors and cool customs.  

The show is pretty exciting, and funny.  The first 2 rows might get a little wet!  Other then that, i think this is great for the whole family."
O,Definitely worth watching. The girlfriend took me to see this and I was very pleased. The transitioning from land to water was amazing. Dont waste your time on NY cirque du soleil shows...stick with vegas... WOW
O,Amazing visual feast.  Well worth the price.  Just see it.
O,I watched a few Cirque du Soleil shows but O takes it to a whole new level. It just left me speechless! I highly recommend going while in Vegas!
O,"Ive have to say that Im enamored with Cirque de  Soleil. O is my 2nd one I have seen. My brother took me to this show when I took another trip to see him. (He has a house in Summerlin).

This performance is at the Bellagio which is a good hotel in Vegas.
O is a water themed Cirque du Soleil show. I was once again amazed.
The only minus I have about the show is that there is a lot of action going on so you do miss some stuff but, you get the overall picture.

The synchronization is just amazing. I was holding my breath praying that none of the performers would make a mistake. They be cutting it really close some time.

The clowns are a good addition to the show but my favorite part is the automated stage that would disappear in section into the water and then reappear with performers on it. I still find that amazing and a little mind numbing.

I appreciate how the institution has performers that a from around the world, instead of from a certain region. This really adds more depth and dimension to the show.

The tickets are bit pricey but I didnt pay...lol
But its worth the money!"
O,"WOW!!! HOW CAN THEY DO THAT????

I had a very good time seeing this performance. When the show started we saw a girl hanging from the very high ceiling!! Man that made my heart almost ran out.

The prob was so great and also the costumes. We saw a lot of performers jumped into the pool one after another in different styles. Im still wondering how can they do that? 

May be it wasnt a show, its a CG!! Who knows? j/k Anyway it worth to see it."
O,"THE BIG O AS IN OH MY GOSH!! WOW THIS MIGHT JUST BE ONE OF CIRQUE DU SOLIELS BEST SHOWS EVER!!!

It definitely lives up to its reputation and unfortunately due to its popularity is still pretty pricey.

Back when I saw this show probably 5+ years ago, I think I spoiled myself in that this was my first ever Cirque du Soliel show I saw live and that no Cirque du Soliel show would ever even come close. So I still have yet to see a better one than this....but theres alot of them in Vegas I have left to see....so well see.

I love how they incorporate the large circular pool of water into their acrobatics, music, and choreography. Wow a humugus pool in the middle of a live theater. Woah! It was so entertaining. Beauty and elegance dominated. Warning to those who like really close seats...you might get splashed on from time to time. This is definitely a talented group, especially all those that perform aquatics. 

I LOVED IT!!! IT WAS WORTH EVERY PRICEY PENNY!!! A MUST SEE SHOW OF LIFETIME IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY!!!"
O,"One of the most visually stunning shows I have EVER seen! EVER! I just dont think it gets better than O! 
My best friend and I went to Vegas for a girls weekend and we each picked a show. Her choice was O. I had never seen it before and she told me that she planned on changing that ASAP. I didnt have very high expectations, I mean how great could it really be? But she raved about it so I went in with an open mind. 
The theatre is beyond beautiful. The music sends you to another place. The costumes are eye candy by themselves. The whole show transports you to another world where the line between reality and fantasy is blurred to perfection. The cast...wow. Their dedication to their craft is obvious. I spent the evening on the edge of my seat with chills running up and down my spine. Yes, it really is that damn good. 
You pay a pretty penny for tickets, but it is so worth it. I will be back...again and again. Because it is such a feast for your eyes, I think more than one viewing is necessary. 
Simply put, amazing. If I could give it more stars, I would."
O,"I so often am helped by Yelper reviews. I hope this one will help others not to make my mistake in seeing  O at Bellagio. I am giving O only 1 star because  this is reflective of my experience in a restricted view seat. The show looks fabulous, I hope to see it again, but in a reasonable seat. If you ask at the ticket office,  they may tell you what they told me--that the restricted view seats, priced at $120 each, only block you from some performer entrances and you sit right next to the seats that cost $180 each. This is absolutely not true. My experience suggests to me the center sections are the ones to sit in, whether close to the stage or far. You need to see the entire spectacle. I think its probably a great show but honestly i missed most of it due to the seating. I accept responsibility for taking the risk but, honestly, i think they really should not sell the seat they sold me--at least without being more transparent about how much view is restricted."
O,"This is the BEST Cirque show that Ive been to (Kooza, Corteo, Delirium). 
absolutely amazing what they did with the acrobatics and the water tank/stage."
O,"Mind-blowingly Beautiful!!!

From the opening moments of clowning around to the beautiful finale, this is a show worthy of spending your hard earned money on.  It radiates joy, beauty and ecstasy.  All of the performers just exude passion and joy from their very tips of their toes.  The music is typically dramatic and enjoyable as all Cirque shows have the manner of being.  I spent the first ten minutes with tears in my eyes at how perfect everything was. Truly with the addition of the pool, they have created such a thrilling and dramatic experience that is sure to stay with you long after youve left Vegas.

Before entering the theatre, spend some time viewing the beautiful sculptures on display featuring some talented Cirque du Soleil performers."
O,"Went to Las Vegas last weekend and based on a recommendation bought tickets to see O.  This was my second Cirque show, but the first in Vegas.  

The show was definitely amazing with breath taking stunts and beautiful scenery.  The theater was beautiful and the tickets were worth every penny.  

So why not a perfect five star?  I think the problem is that once you see a Cirque show, every other Cirque show seems a little too familiar.  Different story line, different scenery, but the same show with a new twist.  For O the twist was the water.  This was amazing.  However, the overall style was something I had seen before.  

Would highly recommend the show if you havent seen one or even if you have and are a big fan.  When in Vegas, we heard that if you were only going to one Cirque show, that this was a good one.  No regrets!"
O,"Amazing. What a great show!

Note: If you sit in the first row or two you might get a little wet, I was in the second row."
O,i felt like i was watching a dream of mine. the water and circus act was out of this world. this is my second show and both are different but loved this one with the water element. ka was my first and enjoyed as much.
O,"Friggin amazing.

I would just mention that its probably much better to sit on the orchestra level than the Mezzanine (where we sat) because your angle is better.  People are coming into and out of the water in odd places all night, and its better that you dont have a preview of where they are going (or coming from) by sitting above it all on the Mezzanine level.

Buy orchestra seats, not Mezzanine."
O,"I didnt know much about O except that it was the show that was playing at the Bellagio.  Since I was staying there, I decided to go.  Im happy I did.

For those who dont know, O is a show involving clowns, dancing, a very large pool, and some truly amazing swimmers and dives.  

My seats ($150 for the 10:30 Sat Night show) were about 13 rows back from the front and off center a little bit.  In some ways, the show is a bit surrealistic insofar as there isnt a traditional, cohesive plot that is usual to western plays or stories.  From what I was able to glean, the show was more reliant on recurring characters, then connected events.  However, at the heart of the show was a man who is whisked away from the very normal world, into the magical world of O, and the different acts (to a greater or lessor degree), follow his immersion in this world.

While the show overall was a visual feast, the dives in particular stood out.  One dive involved 5 people jumping from at least 60 to 70 feet in the air into a part of the pool that could have only been 10x15 feet at the most.  At one part of the show, the performers where on gigantic swings and would catapult 40 feet into the air, conduct spectacular acrobatic moves, then enter flawlessly into the water.  

At tims, I almost wish there was less going on the show, because I wasnt able to concentrate on everything going on.  The stage was large, and everyone was doing something interesting at all times.  

On a closing note, my friend bought a big tub of popcorn, then proceeded to spill it all before the show started.  One of the ushers was kind enough to get  her a replacement tub of popcorn for free.  I thought that was very classy, and a nice touch."
O,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and I really enjoyed it. The clowns were funny, and the acrobatics were amazing. Some parts of the show make you hold your breath, because you cant imagine any good coming from what they are about to do. The best partt of the show is the stage, it is just amazing. Things move around all around and by the time you notice everything is different.  
We sat in section 203 row Q and had a great view of everything that was happening. I do think that you wouldnt want to sit too close to the stage because  of the splashing and you might miss everything that goes on the stage and in the air."
O,"I bought 17 tickets for our group ranging  from 6y/o to 79y/o. We were on the balcony section.
Most of us had seen several Cirque shows before and were generally pleased with those. The O was  hyped as the most amazing Cirque show ever. Well, we were somewhat disappointed. Most of us dozed off from time to time during the show. Although, the kids stayed awake, they said they were bored with the acts. We all appreciated the set, and stage. 
There were lots of synchronized swimming, and dancing (not what we expected from Cirque.)
Maybe, it would have been better if we saw it closer. This theater is huge.  We liked the touring Cirque shows where it was always more intimate, no bad seats inside the tent. We didnt  think this created the same drama, and suspense. It was too slow for us."
O,"Tips for how to enjoy this show to the maximum possible level of enjoyment:

1) Dont go in expecting a story or a plot to follow.  Just prepare to be amazed and in awe.  If you want a storyline - go see KA.  

2) See it twice.  Once in the back or up high.  Once up close front and center.  The first time we went, we sat in the very top near the back.  Some things were difficult to see, there were components I wanted to know more about.  There were pieces of scenes that I missed out on.  But overall, an incredible experience.  It was a perfect spot for a general birds eye view and to be able to take in everything that was going on at one time.  The second time, we were in the 8th row center.  A completely different experience.  Now I could see all the little things I wasnt able to see the first time.  The performers far upstage and just off the wings.  The facial expressions of the acrobats and the cast in the water.  The minute details of what was going on in the water and all around the stage.  It was difficult to get the whole picture from where we were the second time... but having my first experience, it was so incredible to be able to piece it all together.  

3) If you are an engineer - mechanical, electrical, etc... or just totally like to geek out on how things work - this is the Cirque show for you.  I LOVE this show for this reason.  I am fascinated by performance and how it all works together.  This show overwhelms me with human body mechanics and the ability to perform the stunts and skills that they do... the set and the movement of the set pieces and performers ON the set adds a whole new layer of awe.  Even if you cant follow along with what is happening - sit back and appreciate what is taking place in front of you.  The level of coordination, planning, building, practicing, training, preparing, etc... all of that comes together two times a night, five nights a week.  That blows my mind.  And I cant help but wonder - whats the preventative maintenance schedule on those set pieces and the moving stage?  

4) Appreciate the music.  It is live.  Take note of the orchestra that is up and off to the left and right of the stage.  I have the soundtrack.  I listen to it weekly.  And to hear it live makes it so much more rich and fulfilling.

O is my favorite Cirque show.  It is my husbands second favorite.  I believe that O and Ka are the two best shows on the Strip.  At least go once.  And sit in the center.  You will not be disappointed.  Why is it consistently so expensive and why are there never any discounts?  Because they sell out at the higher prices.  That should say something about what you are about to witness when you enter the theatre.

Get there at least 15 minutes before show time to enjoy the pre-show... you wont want to miss it."
O,"This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show and it was the best Cirque du Soleil show I have ever seen (Ive only seen another, Varekai). This one takes place mostly on water and it is simply spectacular! The performers were brilliant, the stories were funny and captivating. 

I had seen Cirque du Soleil on Bravo before this but I fell in love with all things Cirque after experiencing this show. 

Needless to say, I am on a mission to view as many Cirque shows as possible!!"
O,"Being an artist, I often have the tendency to become a big emotional sentimental cry baby when it comes to seeing hauntingly beautiful art. 
This is one of those shows, where, small parts, can bring you back to a beautiful peaceful time in your world, when you were a small child, when everything was innocent, new and clean.  
There are such beautiful segments of music during this show.... so haunting... so peaceful...  I went and bought the CD right after the show.  I play it often while driving.  Its THAT good.  (not annoying like Enya- lol)  I also play it for my clients during facials. They LOVE it.  Even if you have not seen the show, find the CD online, listen to the sample bits and treat yourself to getting this music.  Also- watch the bad video taken from the audience on Youtube. It does not do the show justice, but you can get an idea of the visual stimulation and the performances from those home videos.

This IS the best show in Vegas, hands down.  If you have seen LOVE run to see this and sit around the middle to front of the stage.  You NEED to be back far enough to see the grand picture.  Usually i am in the VIP sections of events and concerts and shows, right up front, but this is a performance that you want to see wide-screen style. 

Youll thank me."
O,"We went to this show last summer, and it was absolutely amazing.  Unbelievable.  Breathtaking.  I could go on.

I felt like a little kid watching this.  I was just in awe.

We had excellent seats, and it was well worth the very high price.  

I think our favorite part of the whole show was the clowns who would come out between the other performers.  Not that the performers werent amazing, but the clowns were funny. :)"
O,"Words cannot possibly do this visual extravaganza justice. You really have to experience this in person. Everything from the beginning where they set up the story to the sheer mechanical prowess of the stage itself, not to leave out the physics defying capabilities of the human body and mastery of the elements, leaves your mind numb. 

I came into the show not expecting anything. Now I want to catch every  other Cirque du Soleils, like they were pokemons. A must see when visiting Vegas."
O,"Once youve seen one Cirque du Soleil, youve kinda just seen them all.  The only things that change is the stage/background/storyline. The acrobatics, contortionists, performances are pretty much the same.

This is a great show, because people are swimming and performing in the water! The synchronized swimming is so interesting and fun to watch. There is a sense of wonder...... underwater exits and entrances? breathing tubes? You will see if you watch the show yourself and all your questions will be answered. 

I sat...... fourth row from the stage in the 3rd seat from the aisle. It wasnt that bad to be sitting up close.... the only time I didnt enjoy my seat was when performers ran up and down the stairs and across the center aisle (which wasnt that often). 

The best seats would be in the back center, or right by the railing in the front center of the balcony."
O,"My first Cirque du Soleil experience and I couldnt have asked for anything better!  Went with the bf and we got a great deal...they have a promo where you buy 1 ticket and get the next ticket for only $25!  We were a little further back then I would have wanted to be but for $175 cant complain.

They do amazing acrobatics and acting both in and out of the water.  They have comedic acts in between all the crazy water diving and tricks which were pretty funny.

I definitely would like to experience and go see some of the other shows in Vegas."
O,"Lovely and beautiful.  Visually stunning, charming and even funny at times!  Ive seen Mystere, Zumanity and LOVE in the past and I love LOVE but you cannot even begin to compare LOVE and O.  Theyre both so spectacular, but the stunts, the diving, etc. of O is breathtaking and awe inspiring!  We sat in in Section 204, Row R  and it was a great spot.  We were slightly bummed beforehand, but  there wasnt much available seating wise for same day tickets.  Theyre not easy to come by from discount ticketers so I urge you to buy them online before your trip or a couple of days in advance from the box office at Bellagio! 

What a magical, memorable experience!  Skip Mystere and Zumanity and go straight to O or LOVE!  Pick Mystere over Zumanity if you cant get either, Mystere definitley is a lovely show, just not quite as good as O or LOVE!"
O,Awful customer service and so so show.  So we went to the Monte Carlo to buy or tickets and they didnt offer any deals ... So I said smart Vegas site had 15% off can I get that ... Eventually they did do that but when we got back to the hotel we saw a magazine saying but one get one for $15 gee would be nice if they offered us that rather than the $250 we spent ... I was upset given there are no refunds once you buy ... But I didnt let that get me down ... We were last row center and in front of us were a group of about a dozen Asian folks ... Which usually is nice but not this time!!!! They kept talking and standing up to take pictures and video tape and their giant phones were bright and it was rather a head out shoulder or phone but we couldnt see a thing.  You would think that someone would stop them given it said no pictures but no ushers nothing we missed most of the show.  The people next to us on both sides said excuse me and grunted several times but these rude folks didnt budge.  We did not enjoy the show or the Aweful customer service.  $250 in the trash.
O,"This is a must see show in Vegas for anyone thats visiting! If you are a fan of Cirque Du Soleil, this show tops all others! The stage design and props are just simply mindblowing and the performers were incredible! Definitely check this out and buy tickets ahead of time since its known to be sold out.

P.S. Tickets are expensive so dont bring anyone who doesnt appreciate the arts! I brought my mom and my aunt and they both fell asleep because it was a late night show and theyre used to sleeping early!! Wasted my money! growl!"
O,"I have tried to explain this to people after seeing the performance.  It was at least 8 months ago and I still have no way of verbalizing what I saw.  Simply astonishing is what I fall back to but that doesnt do Cirque du Soleil - O any justice at all.

I know tickets to this run $150 a piece and up, so I had no expectation of going.  But we got hooked up with free tickets from my buddys boss.  And they were the best in the house.  Lower half, center section, half way up, middle of the row.  Breathtaking.  I was beat from the day and all I wanted to do was take a nap before the show.  But there was NO way I was skipping out on this.  Next time (hopefully free as well) I will have my undivided attention on the stage."
O,"Cirque du Soleil - O
approx. $100.00 pp (ticket price circa 1998)
Somewhere in the Orchestra section

Ok, now dont get fooled by the ticket price.  I am sure its much more expensive now.  I saw their grand opening show about 9 years ago in vegas and was my 2nd. Cirque du Soleil show.  

I can vaguely remember anything about the show except a couple of things.  The first, of course being the ticket price.  It was outrageously expensive at that time and I still remember my jaw dropping when I saw it.  The second being the indoor pool.  It was innovative at that time and something you wont see in any other traditional vegas shows.  

Compare to the other four Cirque shows Id been to, O probably was at the bottom of my list.  Id definitely give them credit for being innovative on the indoor pool, but paying over $100 per head to see synchronized swimming and divings, I think I will pass on that.  

The pool certainly limits the creativity and varieties the show could bring to the audience even though the pool works seamlessly between wet (performing in water) and dry (performing on stage) platform. 

Of course, this review is based on the show I saw 9 years ago and I am certain that there are many improvements done since then.  But Id think the main focus is still the same."
O,"Ive seen three Cirque du Soleil shows so far.  O was my first and still my favorite.  My boyfriend and I got the most expensive seats (sat in the 5th row) when we went and I thought they were way too close.  The theater is relatively small so I dont recommending forking out the extra money for the seats up front.  I actually missed a lot of what was going on inside the water because we were so close.  Only good thing was that I had an awesome view of all the costumes and they were beautiful!

There was not a single dull moment in the show.  I enjoyed watching every performer and their acts.  I think the fact that the whole thing was done in water made it that much more awing.  Definitely recommended!!"
O,"OO yea.. Go and see it!

Make sure you get the Good tickets.. dont get cheap on this one! Its a one in a lifetime experience. .. I regretted getting the backseats.. Dumb I was!!"
O,I was too young to appreciate this.  But now thinking back I know it was a great show and the whole ambiance is amazing.  I would go again just to experience the magic again!
O,"absolutely mind blowing piece of art work that is so amazing words cannot describe! 

i want some of the drugs the creators take bc wow!!!!! thats some good shit! 

inspired me to catch all the cirque du soleil shows i can in the future!!!"
O,Amazing. Was not bored for one second. Only negative point: there isnt really any storyline. Was in the first row and got splashed a few time (just a little).
O,"Alright, Im nna lie, I wasnt expecting to like this show all that much, but the fiancee really wanted to see it and, of course, I obliged.  Overall, I would say the show was visually appealing, but lacked in the story department.  With all the acrobatics you could easily dismiss that flaw.  At times there seemed to be too much going on at once.

The show is about 90 minutes long, and doesnt have an intermission.  This production must really rake it in because the prices are quite high, but I guess they had to pay for the shape-shifting pool. 

The Bellagio theater is pretty good as far as theaters go.  Seats are spacious and there is plenty of leg room, unlike some of the ancient theaters on Broadway.

4 stars for a great acrobatics show, but would have liked a little more story."
O,"Told in a way that only Cirque du Soleil can, O is an amazing show of gymnastics, acrobatics, contortionists, synchronized swimming, and diving.  You cant help but truly appreciate what the human form can do and you might even be inspired to hit the gym or try a yoga class (just be sure not to hurt yourself trying to re-enact something you see at the show).  And in addition to the amazing performers, youll also be amazed at the engineering marvel that is the stage.  A huge swimming pool with a sectioned floor that can rise and submerge while keeping virtually all of the water in the tank???  Fantastic!

The only other thing I can say is that even though the front row seats cost more, they arent, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  Because there is so much going on in the show, I would actually recommend seats further back so that you can see everything going on on stage.  

A must see if youre in Vegas!"
O,"Simply AMAZING...

This Cirques concept is truly incredible in how it incorporates water. The stage is so freaking cool. The performers are super talented. The show was just OFF THE HOOK.

Really pricey, but well worth every penny. :)"
O,"AMAZING ---
I really enjoyed it, even though the tix were pretty expensive.
I recommend you watch the show from Orchestra seats as it does not carry the same effect if you seat in the back row :)"
O,"Completely exceeded my expectations!!

It has been a while since I have seen a Cirque du Soleil show
and what a way to come back to it with a BANG or i guess a SPLASH!!

It was just so moving to me, the music, the acrobatics, the stage
in general was just AMAZING! the sheer massiveness of it alone is
breathtaking but adding water to the stage just sends it over the top.
The fact that the stage actually can submerge as well is mind blowing.

I loved the show, and im listening to the soundtrack as Im writing this
review. I highly recommend that if you have the money spend it to see O!!"
O,"This is the best Cirque du Soleil ever. Everything was incredibly detailed. Even the smallest sound was choreographed. The acts were amazing. I cannot believe that the actors are capable of what they do. It was a surprise how funny the clowns were. At first I thought they were random, but they totally added to the ambiance of the whole show. 

I will definitely watch this show again. And probably again."
O,"One of the best parts of seeing a show like this in Vegas is how all of the obsession with gaming and drinking seems to drop from everyones persona and we all return to be little kids fascinated by spectacle and possibility!

O is an absolutely beautiful show filled with very talented performers. If you have never seen a Cirque du Soleil show, it is absolutely worth the price per ticket (though there are discounts to be had). That being said, I was not blown away and transported as I was with KA. Perhaps I am just so linear that I need more narrative--so if you know that about yourself, you might prefer KA. And still another caveat--if you are really interested in how a stage can transform and change and wonder how all of it works, the you must see O, because from that perspective, I was pleasantly stunned.

I think the point in the end is that you must see more than one Cirque du Soleil show to truly appreciate the style!"
O,"Fantastic, awe-inspiring, fascinating, truly amazing piece of art.  Ive been twice and would highly recommend seeing this show at least once!  The stage in such a trip, I still cannot figure out how they do it.  Water, no water, people, no people, where does it all go so quickly????  Go see this show if you can, you wont be sorry!"
O,"After Mystere, this is my next favorite.  Very talented performers.  Worth your time and money."
O,"This is the best show I have ever seen in my LIFE. It also helps that we got free FRONT ROW tickets from myvegas. The show was amazing, and getting splashed with water did not affect us. We still had a great time. The costume was amazing, the performers were great, and the photographer outside of the theater was amazing as well. All in All A+++++"
O,"Awesome but almost too much. There were also subtle mistakes that most wouldnt notice but a trained eye caught easily. 
But worth seeing"
O,"Good but its not my fave (mystere is).

It pays to butter up your concierge/casino host for good tickets. 

Cuz some of them get wet!!! (Yuck, especially if you are wearing your new Marc Jacobs!)"
O,"Just saw the show and LOVED it! Paid $165 for left-of-center seats in the 6th row and it was TOTALLY worth it. What it lacks in narrative, it makes up for in sheer imagination, daring and beauty. Everything from the costumes to the curtains are used to create an environment thats part dream and part fairy tale.

Ive given it 4 stars cause the last half wasnt as spectacular as the first. Notice, I say spectacular cause the second half was wonderful, but the first was breath taking."
O,"If you had to see one show in Vegas, this would be it. Best acrobatics and best production Set. get your tickets in advance and if you want to have the best view of the synchronized swimming, pay less and sit at the upper balcony. :)

Its my favorite cirque show and ive been to about 4."
O,"Im speechless!! Cant describe how wonderful it is and how impressive Ive got. I will bring my family to watch the show! 

Remember to register for tickets, do research on-line before you pay!"
O,"WOW! this is the kind of show where you end up leaving breathless! the tickets were kinda of pricey ($150 each), but well worth every penny. 

we sat up top at just about the center, which was perfect. there is so much going on in the show that if you are too close to the stage, you will definitely miss stuff. even then, there is so much going on that you truly cant see everything. it is beyond entertaining and amazing what these people can do. the acrobatics, gymnastics, clowns, contortionists and synchronized swimming... ALL AMAZING! i loved how most of the show is incorporated with water. 

this is a show i would see again; and in my opinion is the best show in vegas!"
O,"I cant believe i havent reviewed this show.  This was my first ever Vegas show because what can you really do in Vegas being 19 or 20 without a fake id.  

I had an interest in cirque du soleil shows previously (watching it on tv) but after seeing this show i fell in LOVE with cirque du soleil productions.  

I had the best seats ever courtesy of my friends dads gaming habits :o)  It was dead center and only a few rows up from the stage.  This show was phenomenal.  The acrobatic sequences kept me on the edge of my seat.  The platform that the whole show was performed on was amazingly built.  This is a must see show and money well spent!!!"
O,"I agree with Erik S.s review 10/12/2008.  The magnitue of the production is quite impressive.  A great deal of attention is paid to capture perfection, but the lack of an overall storyline made this more of random circus acts put together.  After the first half of twirling and spinning in the air, I was hoping for more variety  in the second.  But, alas, no such luck.  The acrobats just kept jumping into the water in different ways; not that these feats are, any stretch of the imagination, easy, but repetitive.  The one break, I recall, was the fire act, perhaps a plug for Ka.

In the end, the entire performance was visually stunning and satisfying.  I would recommend the show, but not so much as to give it 5-stars.  Go if you wish, but just go with moderate expectations."
O,"This was a fantastic Cirque show.  The theater had excellent seating and there probably was not a bad seat in the house.  If you sit in the first two rows, you may get wet but its relatively minor.

Also, you can bring in your own snacks and drinks to save money.  The only thing is if its in a glass container, they make you put it in a plastic cup.  This is a lot better than other shows in the strip (ahem Phantom of the Opera) where you cant bring in anything period.

The show is a little on the longer side (around 2.5 hours) but youre definitely engaged throughout the whole thing."
O,5 stars all the way!!!! The show was OMG amazing!!! Loved it! The stage OMG a genius! Seriously! You Have to see it its worth every penny it really set my standards high! And I had the best seat in the house :-)
O,"I am not a big fan of shows or musicals, but everyone said we had to see a show when in Vegas, so we picked O because of all the hype.

Paid about $85 per ticket, which was a big discount.  We were on the balcony on the side, so it was annoying to look to the left the whole time, but I suggest sitting up high so you can see into the water.

I did enjoy it, but I didnt get the storyline, which the usher told us that O is one of the few Cirque shows that has a storyline.  He explained a bit before the show, but it still didnt flow that well.

The music was enjoyable, the acrobats were amazing, and it was fun overall, but it was a little too long for me and the seats (as everyone else has said) are reallly uncomfortable.  Didnt help that I was completely exhausted from our few days in Vegas (it was our last night).

Im glad I saw it because it was a memorable experience.  If you like shows, especially Cirque, Id say its worth it; otherwise you may want to save your money."
O,"I agree with some of the other posts. If youve seen traditional acrobatic acts before or seen the Cirque Du Soleil highlights on TV then this show probably wont impress you. The most amazing thing about this show for me was the stage that opens to become a pool and closes to become a stage, the divers that are in the tank moving props and such, and the endurance of the swimmers and dancers. Also, a warning about the back balcony seating, from this section you will have a hard time watching the pre-show skits with the clowns."
O,"Loved it! This is my 3rd cirque show, and I think it may be my favorite. When I was sitting there I kept talking to myself saying OMG how did he do that? Oh no shes going to fall! Good thing people around me didnt hear me...but I got really into the show!"
O,Duh! I have to give this show 5 stars because my awesome cousin is one of the performers! Connections ROCK!
O,"Superb! I was really entertained and surprised on each corner. Love it. You have to experience this. If you do, get center front seats. Its the only was to watch these types of shows."
O,This is the best show in Vegas in my humble opinion. I watched all Cirque shows and this is the best.
O,"Amazing show, the performers are so talented and the whole performance is well put together. I never knew you could do so much acrobatic acts in the water. I love how everything is so synchronized. The contortionists... ouch. The whole show is mind blowing!

The stage is the craziest thing ever!! It transforms into water and back to solid ground and back into water. Be careful if you sit in the front because you will be splashed! Wonderful show!"
O,"What a phenomenal experience. Absolutely nothing can prepare someone from the sheer awesomeness that happens on stage during this presentation, nothing. Tickets were close to $200, but as an arts major in college and having a special chunk of my heart set aside for musical and visual production, it was easily the best money spent on my trip to Las Vegas. Without giving the premise of the show away, I will say that there is water, there is a stage, sometimes the performers are swimming and diving and within a matter of moments theyre on dry land again. There is diving from freakish heights, there are clowns, there is dancing, and a remarkable musical composition. This is not a travelling show, it cant be produced anywhere other than a stationary very highly technical theater so if you find yourself looking for a unique experience in Las Vegas this is it."
O,I am in LOVE with Cirque du Soleil after watching O while in Vegas. It was wonderful &amp; truly amazing. Worth every $
O,"I finally got to Vegas and went to see Cirque and I was disappointed. The stage and the orchestra are the stars of the show. The acrobats were certainly talented, but I couldnt get into the show. Some of the skits were very odd and the show didnt flow well. Im sorry we spent $250. I recommend seeing Phantom."
O,"AMAZING! I got great tickets 5th row, which I discovered is not really necessary anything lower level should be good enough. From the moment the curtain goes up you know its going to be a great show. Fiance said if she didnt know any better she would think she was on shrooms. A lot going on all the time, hard to know where you should be looking so you dont miss something. Stage itself is impressive, raises and lowers throughout the show to be a solid surface or pool deep enough to dive into. Some parts are slow and some parts ago on too long. Yes it is all amazing but once you know they can do something, it loses the wow factor. Even though I paid a lot for the tickets I was ready for it to be over by the end. We both needed a bathroom break but didnt want to miss something. There are a few times when you basically get a break in the action and can go, if you see the clowns you have some time before things start up again. You can pick up tickets day before at any MGM location but the day of you MUST go to Bellagio box office and you must be there atleast an hour before showtime. Line gets long so dont wait til last second for will call. Would not see again. I know people see Cirque shows several times, once is enough for me. I would like to see other Cirque productions though."
O,"I havent been to too many of these shows, but it was pretty awesome. 

Id recommend you spring for the best seats you can get.  They are pretty ridiculously expensive, but it is worth it.  We sat in the third row and you can see a lot more detail regarding what is going on in the water.  We had to make reservations a couple months in advance, but it was worth it.

I have no idea what the plot of the thing was - it was definitely artsy fartsy, which would have annoyed the hell out of me if the acrobats hadnt been awesome to watch.

And dont buy popcorn while youre watching the show.  That makes you look like a tool."
O,"I honestly dont know why people are giving this show 5 stars. The show was a complete mess. Throughout the entire show people were running around the set randomly while 3-4 different acts were also all happening all at the same time. It was impossible to figure out what the hell was happening. There was no storyline, it had boring music, was chaotic, and quite expensive. And to top it off, they added a couple clowns that spent 20 minutes performing random pointless comical acts that werent even remotely funny.   The divers are extremely talented but unfortunately the show was pure chaos and a waste of time."
O,"This show was recommended to us as one of the best to see when in Vegas. We went and were not let down, it was excellent! Ive heard its the best of the Cirque shows, but I cant comment on that since this was the only one I saw. Either way, see this show!"
O,"Ive seen several Vegas shows since I saw O years ago, and it is still my favorite show in Vegas. Make sure you buy tickets in advance; at least the last time I checked, O isnt included in the discounted half-price tickets that you can get on the day of the show for many other shows in Vegas. It is a bit pricey compared to other shows but well worth the unique experience. I recommend the show to everyone visiting Las Vegas and would definitely see it again myself."
O,"This was a very nice show.  The performers were very good and show was very professionally done. I loved the acrobats and the diving.

I wouldnt sit through it again, but I am glad that I saw it."
O,"Great show, starts off a little slow but then really picks up.  The entire water stage is amazing art all its own"
O,"Spectacular show, I definitely recommend the Cirque du Soleil O at Bellagio if you visit Las Vegas.  Impressive stage, one second its a pool and the next the performers walk on it, would love to see how the whole thing works.  Seated near the side wall, section 101, close to the stage, great seats.  Doors open 30 minutes prior to the start, the whole show is about 90 minutes, photos not allowed.  Cool pre-show act with two clowns walking up the aisles/seats squirting the crowds (and I dont even like clowns!).  Amazing acrobats, fire jugglers, contortionists, synchronized swimmers, divers... sets, costumes, music, lights.  Was hesitant because of the expensive ticket cost, but definitely worth it, a must see at least once."
O,"first time I was blown away in Vegas. After so many trips there, so many shows. No other performance can be compared to it. You gotta see it yourself! Absolutely amazing!"
O,"There is only one word that I can describe this show, and it is MAGICAL. Sounds cheesy, yes, but even after 13 years of being in business, the performers are still highly precise and enthused with their routines. Every minute youre turning your head and wondering how it just happened. I still cant imagine these guys performing almost 7 days a week, and sometimes twice a night. My boyfriend and I originally had doubts to watch the show since it was so pricey (and we figured it might have been too hyped up) but believe me, it was definitely worth every penny in the end. We bought best available seats and ended up in the front row - amazing! But beware, if you are in the first couple of rows, you will get splashed on...nonetheless, highly highly recommended."
O,What a fantastic production! The scale and skill of this show is definitely a must see. This was my first Cirque show and I cant wait to see another one. All the performers from the synchronized swimmers to the clowns were great. Definitely see this show if you get a chance.
O,O blows all the other shows out of the water! Get the best seats you possibly can- its worth it. A must see!!
O,"The absolute best thing we did in Vegas. I have never been to a Cirque show so I cant compare it that way, but this was by far the best circus style show I have seen in my life.
The set was completely amazing! Even the curtain was exciting! The pool is used in so many innovative ways -- we were continually amazed. This is an absolute MUST SEE. 
One bad: there are these clowns that perform inbetween amazing acts and they are kinda cheesy. I think they were important though cause they alllowed time for the crew to get ready for the next act."
O,"I was intrigued after seeing the behind-the-scenes tour on the Discovery Channels Time Warp. Then after watching the trailer on the Cirque website I had to see O. Id never seen a Cirque du Soleil show, much less a show in Las Vegas. I was able to find a 25% discount on tickets for the 10:30 shows through the Bellagio website.

O is amazing and surreal, with a little comic relief from a couple of clowns. Take it all in, stage, artists, costumes, music. A great performance is always supposed to leave you wanting more and this one did not disappoint!

Cant wait to see more Cirque du Soleil!"
O,"An absolutely amazing show!  I cant go to another cirque show because this show has ruined it for all my future shows. No other cirque is as good as this one not to me anyway. The performance was flawless and  definitely worth it to spend the extra money to get great seats to this show.  If theres only one show you plan on seeing in Vegas, this is it."
O,"This was my 1st show in Vegas, it was soooo worth the $$$ !!! I like how this cirque show doesnt travel and is particular to Vegas! Make sure you are in center, 1st or 2nd level for best seats! A-mazing performers!"
O,"One of the better CdS shows Ive been too.  Visually stunning, excellent production, decent comic relief.  The water aspect is very different from other CdS shows.  If you sit in the first two rows, be willing to get wet.  I highly recommend it during your visit--worth the expense."
O,"Holy shit balls what an incredible show! The fiance took me during our one night in Vegas drive through. Seriously Im not a wuss but I cried through the first 30 minutes of the show! It was totally embarrassing. I def suggest you see this if you can. Its the first Cirque De Soleil and still one of the best selling, and in Vegas that says something. You WILL be amazed!"
O,Ive never seen a show quite like it. Really this is one of the best shows Ive ever seen and Im not sure how to compare it. There are the many acrobats and contortionists but with the the music and costumes and water and sets are all just amazing. See it and you will have a great time.
O,"O  M  G.  hee hee get it? O...OMG.  

oh my god, becky, this was like totaly tubular.  you so-o have to see this, I swear.  you are so gonna die!  its awesome!  fer real, yo!!"
O,"You cannot say enough good words about O.

Its a shame they dont have a DVD of the performance, or I would be buying myself one and my family so they can experience it.

From the very beginging to the very end, it will keep you at the edge of your seat and sitting with your mouth agape in awe.

For some reason....I LOVED the clowns. They just stole my heart. When the short clown, breaks into dance and has the facial expression of putting in soo much effort....

Recommend getting close seats. You can see the effort that the artits go through to put on a quality performance... GOOO SEE THIS SHOW!"
O,I now understand what all the fuss is about. This show is magical. I want to go to Vegas again just to see it. Its hard to take so much in. I just LOVED it. The talent displayed by these people is truly amazing.
O,"As everyone pointed out, the choreography, costumes and set were all amazing, probably the best in Vegas. However, being a Cirque du Soleil show, I was expecting more stunts and scenes that blow me away. Unfortunately, that did not happen. I guess I have to see other Cirque du Soleil shows for that. Nevertheless, the O Show blends many theatrical aspects into one very unique, dazzling show."
O,"Cirques show O will never disappoint you and it is always an experience to behold, this great performers represent everything that is beautiful and wonderful about being a human being, poetry music and motion come together in an experience like no other. Enjoy the show and remember to blink, this show will transform what you think is possible by human beings. Make sure to grab seats in the center section if possible and right now there is some great deals for locals. Enjoy"
O,"Comparatively, Le Reve was much more entertaining and awe inspiring water acrobatics show than O with better seating arrangement and a more cohesive story line."
O,"This show is a MUST-SEE!!!

This show was so unique, in that it was performed in a 25ft deep pool! These performers are AMAZING! Not only can they do gymnastics and acrobatics, but they are amazingly beautiful swimmers and divers. 

The element of water gave this show a very intriguing, captivating, and almost sensual edge, compared to other cirque shows. 

Every moment of the show was thrilling to watch, and every part of the show will appeal to ALL ages. 

The production itself was also fantastic. The music really complimented the acrobatics perfectly, and took you on a ride of different emotions/feelings. And it was ALL done live (music, singing, performing).

We had middle balcony seats, which we were very nervous about before the show. But honestly, I had zero complaints about the view!! If you can only seem to get balcony seats, I would say go for it!...But try to get the seats in the middle of the rows of the balcony, so you wont have to watch it from a weird angle.

This show was one of the most stunning performances I have ever seen. I will be back in Vegas to see the other Cirque shows!!!"
O,"Uhhmm.....Not so much. Dont get me wrong, I love it when  there is a circus without any abused animals, but I just have to say, I think they are totally overrated. So expensive and Im just not impressed. Basically, a lot of water and women who could lick their own vaginas."
O,"I only have snippets of other Cirque performances to compare this to, but I loved it.  I was definitely digging my fingers into my moms arm for a good chunk of the time.  I thought for sure someone would go flying too far off of that little swing thing and land in the audience.  I can only imagine the effort that goes into putting these shows together - the time spent rehearsing, the money, the number of employees working behind the scenes. . . worth it!  It looks so effortless and the death defying feats almost seem doable by the average girl sitting slack jawed in the audience.  Dont worry, I wont actually try any of it.  I cant even touch my toes these days, let alone fly through the air with the greatest of ease."
O,Just watching that pool come and go was awesome.  This was a great entertaining show. I was always on the edge of my seat wonder what was coming next.  The performers are amazing.
O,"I liked it a lot, but I didnt love it. I was expecting to love it and pee my pants in my seat. I didnt even pee my pants a little. However, it is quite amazing and I believe that any Cirque du Soleil show is something everyone should experience live. Beautiful costumes, beautiful staging, beautiful talent...just beautiful. I think the water aspect was not for me...I like the Cirque shows with more dance and movement. We sat in the balcony and I found those to be great seats b/c I always love seeing the entire stage picture. Good time and I suggest everyone should go!"
O,"Ive been to a ton of shows... Cirque du Soleils, Broadways, Operas....and this is hands down the most incredible experience Ive ever had!!! We sat in Row B (second from the stage), right in the center at seats 14&amp;15...absolutely incredible! Beautiful! Stunning! Jaw-dropping!"
O,"Unbelievable.  We were front-center, 11 rows up.  The best Cirque de Soleil Ive seen.  An amazing acrobatics and aquatics show!!!  Every seat appeared to be a good seat.  Funny and great entertainment."
O,"One of my dreams was to watch the O, this dream started back when I was a high school student.  I was a poor kid, so it took many many years before I was able to see this show.  Boy, was it worth the wait.  It was so creative and beautiful...I loved it so much, and am so happy that one of my little dreams came true!"
O,"The Emperor has no clothes.
My wife and I were given tickets to this event for our 25th anniversary.  We went with great expectations, after all, it WAS in the Bellagio, we didnt pay a dime, and the reviews were excellent.  
  The venue was great, the stage was set in a large pool with grates / false bottoms that could be raised and lowered in an instant.  They could go from swimming to standing dry and back to swimming in a matter of seconds all on the same spot. 
  Well then, how was the show itself?  If you like trapeze acts, synchronized swimming and clowns you might like the show.  I dont. And I didnt.
  My main complaint is that I waited and waited for something spectacular to happen and it never did.  It was just a series of disjointed circus acts, the first as ordinary, long, and boring as the next. Some, like the clown acts, were just plain bad.  I sat through the performance checking my watch every five minutes or so, counting down the minutes for it to end.  This was pert near the longest 95 minutes of my life.  When it finally did end, (thank the Lord)  and my wife and I were making our way to the exit, I politely told her to thank the folks that gave us the tickets, I had no intention of spoiling it for her and telling her how lame I thought it was.  After all, she loves that kind of stuff, and I dont.  Just before we got to the final exit of the Bellagio she said, Wow, did that suck or what?  Um, well, Make sure you thank them for the tickets I responded.  Again, I didnt want to appear ungrateful, and was not sure she meant what she said.  Yeah, it was a bit slow I admitted.  SLOW? It just plain sucked! she announced.   OK so it wasnt just me.  My wife, who can watch ice skating and gymnastics on the tube Sunday afternoon  for hours on end thought it sucked as well.   I must  admit, If I paid $10 and saw the same show at the Barnum and Baileys Circus when it came to town I would have been just as bored but a lot less disappointed.
Honestly, I dont have an axe to grind and Im not trying to be mean.  I really wanted to like this show. Also, I dont want to imply the performers and musicians were sub-par.  Not at all, they were excellent, no fault of theirs the production sucked.
Did I mention the tickets were $115 each including tax, and those were the cheap ones?
I truly believe people give this a 5 star rating because they just blew well over $200 for some silly circus act and need to confirm with others, that what they saw and paid for, was indeed an incredible work of genius and not a pathetic scam."
O,"All I have to say is O My Gosh!!!!! lol. (Usher Song reference there). Definitely a must see for anyone who wants to see a show in Las Vegas. I sat smack dab in the front section 8 rows from the front, perfect middle, so I have to say my seats were Awesome! Best seats in the house to me, but of course almost every seat in the house was in great view of the stage. 
   Ok I had a few shots of Patron right before the show cause it was Cinco de Mayo. That did make it a little more fun. Not that the show needed any help for it to be great. But I LOVED O. My favorite Vegas show to date. I had a feeling that I was almost in a different world. The attention to detail was just out of this world. The performances were top notch. I personally have nothing bad to say about this show. Its hard to give this review because I want to talk about every little detail and how great it all was, but at the same time I really dont want to give anything away. The person next to me was covering her mouth with her hands because she was in awe the whole time. Im not gonna lie, I noticed my jaw was dropped as well for much of the show. 
 If youre going to watch this show, its a must that you buy your tickets in advance. As I was going in to sit down, the stand by line was very long. So its safe to say many of those guests did not get in to watch the show that night. Also They start seating 30 mins before the show starts. If you do reserve tickets in advance its recommended you pick your tickets up before 4 pm the day of the show. otherwise your seats may be given away. Or so thats what I read on my email confirmation. 
So my end conclusion is that this show is a must see for anyone. Tickets arent cheap, but it is still without a doubt worth every penny. Everything to me is art. And this show is definitely a masterpiece!!!"
O,"Best Cirque show on the strip.  The performers are amazing, the acts are jaw dropping, and the music suites every act perfectly and really helps feeling engaged in the performance.  I have seen the show twice and suggest choosing the seats in the front row of the balcony, really allows to take in everything going on throughout the entire stage.  Just writing this review makes me want to see it again, its that good."
O,"Absolutely amazing.  It could have been better if I hadnt passed out for most of the show.  Too much boozing pre-show, no good."
O,"watched this show on valentines day and WOW. this show was amazing. with great humor, exotic costumes, and  dramatic make up...this show is very worth watching. 

my boyfriend and i sat in section 104 row k. when purchasing the tickets i assumed our seats wouldve been a little higher up but was pleasantly surprised upon arrival to find that we had the perfect seats. in my opinion i think its always best to try to sit a little higher up than to be in the front row. that way you are able to have a good view of the whole stage and see their faces clearly. plus with this show, youll get wet if your in the front ;)

the acrobatic performers were amazing!! some of their stunts were so unbelievable it makes you wonder  HOW DEEEP is this water??? props and lighting are always a big influence to how well a show is as well and you know it has to be good when it can get the crowd to do the ooooooooooo

i usually hate clowns...but these two clowns in the show were pretty darn funny and entertaining. 

with two tickets..it was about 360...but very well worth it..."
O,"This was the only Cirque du Soleil show that I had not seen (aside from the Beatles one which doesnt really appeal to me). It was a hot, hot, hot summer and I finally got to dress up. Upon entering theatre there is a giant pool of water on stage. Amazing! This show was breath-taking. The stunts they did using the water, the synchronized swimming, the acrobatics, EVERYTHING was amazing. I will never forget the performers that were jumping from the ceiling into a tiny pool of water. What if they miscalculated?!?!? Anyways, no accident thank goodness. This is a must see! Might be one of the most expensive Cirque du Soleil shows I have seen but well worth it!"
O,"This is the best show Ive ever seen!!! Tickets are expensive, but worth every dime get the best seats possible, if not you will regret it."
O,"It was great but I liked Kooza better. Maybe it was our seats in the back but the balcony looks really good if you can get a front seat there. I like the transitions between a solid stage and pool. However, I would have liked to see more stunts and flying around. I know the main theme here is water but they pretty much just jumped into the giant pool over and over. The comedic portion was not as good as koozas but it did get a few laughs out of me. The music really shined at this show."
O,"This is without a doubt, THE best cirque show (IMO). I LOVE the water aspect, it really just takes the entire show to whole other, unbeatable level. Ive seen: Ka, Mystere, Allegria, Verakai and out of all of them, O is my favorite (Ka being my second favorite). The traveling shows are really good, but to me, they kind of all seem the same (but that will never deter me from going whenever theyre in my area) and they just dont compare to the Vegas shows. This is also the show with my favorite soundtrack (I bought the Corteo soundtrack and DVD as well). I listen to it all the time, its very calming and it almost makes me nostalgic.....I immediately am brought back to the O theatre and my first experience in Vegas. I would definitely see this show again. As for all of you going to see it with high high high expectations, I would say that you will be blown away but you shouldnt go expecting anything except to see a great show. 

Bravo cirque! :) You made me a fan for life after this show! 

p.s. to all of you who bring cameras and try to snap pics, dont do it!! i heard performers can make mistakes and for those of you whove seen the shows, youre already sweating enough from their acrobatics, how guilty would you feel if you were the cause of a potential injury????"
O,"they say, your first cirque will always be your favorite.  maybe i was lucky or it just is, but i lost my cirque cherry to o... oh, o.

this is one of the TOP THREE best cirque shows in the world!!  check out my list to see where they all stand: http://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=yQFdq5_1fvcdwo17p08c_w

o is a water show. know that you can get wet if you sit too close to the performance. ...yes, this includes the balcony, as some performers may wander.  -- stars based on category, not food"
O,"Ive seen O, KA and La Nouba.  O was my first and best Cirque du Soleil show.  The acrobatics, diving, tumbling, story line, etc. were all amazing.  We sat front and center and I remember feeling like a dream was being played out in front of me.  This is an absolute must see regardless of the price."
O,"Maybe its the overdose of Cirque du Soleil shows we get bombarded with annually in the Bay Area because I was really disappointed in Os performance.  Mystere set the standard for me in my mind years ago and people told me O was 10 times better with water.  I had to wake myself up a couple of times throughout the show.  There were a few highlights, but they didnt outweigh the low points of the performance.  Even the clown acts between acts, I was like What the hell are they doing?  I wish I saw Zumanity or Le Reve instead!"
O,"I must say... This show was fascinating, beautiful and imaginative. It was like going into someones head and seeing what they are dreaming. I loved the acrobatics, synchronized swimming, the diving and costumes. There were two clowns that provide comic relief for this otherwise serious show. I dont want to give too much away. Ive seen Ka as well and I in my opinion, O was a lot better."
O,"Absolutely fantastic....worth every bit of the ticket price!   We were seated to the right of the stage about 8 rows up on the main floor and the view was perfect!  I was blown away and would recommend this show highly, especially to Vegas first-timers"
O,"Cest tres magnifique!!!!  I wont bore everyone with saying too much, since there have been 450 reviews already on this wonderful show!  All I can say is that the entire circque performance exceeded any expecations I could possibly have.  It really blew my mind.  The stage, and the water was absolutely amazing.  I would highly recommend anyone to see this show in Vegas.  It is one of a kind and definitely worth it."
O,"Definitely worth the price of admission.  Although the clown portions of the show are probably the worst Ive ever seen, the rest of the show makes up for it."
O,"Exhilarating! I have heard about seeing something so beautiful you are moved to tears and I definitely felt this when I watched O. Perhaps O stands for Orgasm...for your eyes or just the sounds youll keep making O! in reaction to all the stunts. There were so many amazing things happening at the same time, I didnt know what to watch! The seats were amazing too! We sat in the 7th row smack in the middle, which gave us a perfect view of everything! Definitely worth the money to see something so spectacular."
O,I have watched this show 2 times.  Both times I leave in awe.  This is a masterpiece.  The show is expensive but worth it.  Much better than Le Reve or KA or any other show.  Just make sure you get good seats or its not worth the money.  First time I sat near the back.. still good.  The second time I had great seats and I was like wow.  What a difference.  A must see!
O,"alas, not 5 stars the second time.  its still great, but its just not as good the second time.  i think one should only see this show once...and for the love, sit as close as you can to the stage, so you can look at all the incredible outfits.   you cannot be too close to the stage in this theater.  anyway, the performance was AMAZING...go if you havent!"
O,"It only takes a moment to become immersed in Os paradoxical world of the grotesque and beautiful.  The stage itself plays the greatest role in the show as the shape-shifting, amphibious plane of existence in which Eugen, the aged and weathered theater manager, orchestrates his own retrogradation to youth and purity.  Just as the waters of O cleansed Eugens heart, so too was my faith in live theater."
O,"My second Cirque du Soleil show. After seeing Mystère in 2005, I had to watch this one! So in 2006 I found the opportunity to watch O. The stunts and feats are even more amazing than they were in Mystère! However, this one lacked more in vocals and story, but still great. The humor is great, but feels more like they use it to stall for preparation time. Last year, I watched this show again with my boyfriend and it was just spectacular. The amount of water on stage is mind-boggling. Its creative use of an enormous aquatic setting is definitely worth seeing!"
O,"Truly amazing! The best show Ive seen in Vegas. Better than Ka, Zumanity, Mystere, etc. It was also the first CDS show Ive seen - back in NYE 2000. My bro bought me the soundtrack and I listened to nonstop for months! Its the most beautiful show on the strip."
O,"The stage and water effects were neat. I also liked the style of the design they used. Like others had said before, if you sit at a elevated level, you will see how the people stay underwater that long. For people that sit closer at a lower level, it would be amazing to see so many people pop in and out of the pool. But like I said before I liked the design and choreography of the whole show but some parts were a bit boring."
O,LOVED IT!  I was was spell-bounded from beginning to end.  Luckily Cirque du soleil were offering tickets for half off so I splurged and got the front row wet seats.  Totally makes me want to check out more Cirque Du Soleil shows in Vegas!!
O,"This made me want to run away and join the circus. Too bad I cant swim and am not that flexible anymore...sigh....and I really wanted to be that little Zebra girl who just runs around and strikes a pose until I tried striking one of her poses in the mirror and I just looked like an idiot. My dreams crushed...once again. Ok, enough of that. This show is seriously amazing. I loved loved loved it. I think the only part that I wasnt too fond of were the acts with the two guys on top of the little boat, yeah that bored me. But the acrobatics and dives and swing ship hanging from the ceiling, I was in awe. But, I am set to see Mystere this Sunday and am afraid that O has spoiled any other Cirque experience in my future."
O,"minimum of $100 a ticket

theres no actual storyline, but its still a damn good time.

the show is really amazing, just go in and relax. 
theres so much going on at once.

and wow the music that goes along with the show is live. 
you can see the musicians playing their violins, cellos, and other instruments in the sideboxes to the right and left of the stage.

the only part of the show i didnt really enjoy were the short parts with the clown, i felt like it didnt fit in with the rest of the program.
i do realize they did these as a comedic relief / break in between for the other performers, but they couldve done something a little more relative to the show.

+ intricate, unique, beautiful performances
+ interesting combination of elements and mediums
- tickets are sold out  for practically every show"
O,"Enjoyed the show, a little boring without any story but still cool acrobatics and big pool of water which the show takes place around."
O,"Loved it! It was so unbelievably artistic and mesmerizing.  You totally get so engulfed in it, like youre having some crazy Alice in Wonderland dream.. I really appreciate the talent of all the performers and the visual effects.. its almost like.. whoa that am I looking at. Would definat recommend"
O,My dad and I much preferred this show to the Mystere one.  He was very impressed with how quickly the stage filled/emptied the water.
O,"Amazing show.  Great visuals, and amazing acrobatics.  Ive seen amny Cirque Du Soleil performances, and this is by far the best.   Id highly recommend getting close up seats, as from a far distance, it can be hard to see everything going on.    The only thing I didnt really get was the clown performances during the show.   I imagine they were there for comic relief, but their humor was so slapstick, it kind of cheapened the whole deal for me."
O,"To this day, 6 years later, this is still my favorite Cirque do Soleil show and I have seen A LOT of them and have become a Cirque du Soleil junkie... The show surpasses any imagination: the amazing and out of this World costumes (wild African affairs, forest, fire), artists jumping in and out of water as if it were nothing, the incredible music that brings you back to whatever place is being recreated on stage, unbelievable skills and talent - entertainment at its best even by the Vegas standards!"
O,"This surreal show only gets more magical every minute you sit through it. The fact that everything is performed live, with such perfect synchronization and harmony between the artists on stage is astonishing. The gymnastics were mind blowing, and so was the choreography, direction and the interludes during the show. I also loved the music in the show. This is a must watch show  in Vegas!"
O,"my first cirque du soleil show...and probably my last.  =(

i knew it was quite popular and lots of people love this show.  the performance did not amaze me as i thought it would.  some of the parts were great...but there were other sequences that seemed pointless and time fillers...like on the boat!  i like the fact that they use water so creatively...transitioning from solid stage to water pool instantly...

maybe im just not a cirque du soleil type of person...but i always thought i would like it.  the cost of the ticket is insanely expensive too...maybe its the fact that no one talks or its just too arty for me.  another suggestion is to not see this if youre drunk or youre around drunk people...because drunk people are either loud (and annoy everyone in the theater) or they fall asleep so you wasted money on their ticket!  lets just say, i experienced both scenarios with my group of friends."
O,"This show was amazing.  It was well worth the 130 dollars for obstructed view seats.  The storyline was pretty linear, although it did get kind of confusing at the end.  Its not even the story that matters though, as much as the beauty of the choreography.  The only thing that sucked about this was the creepy guy at the souvenir shop that was telling us about his beauty sleep."
O,"We had very highly expectations for O and it sure lived up to the hype. We were hooked from beginning to the end. It was jaw dropping, exciting, entertaining, an A++++ production all the way."
O,"A totally spellbinding experience! I wont divulge anything, but I thought the stunts were incredibly beautiful and completely astounding seeing as they were being performed in a 20 foot deep pool. My boyfriend splurged for front-row seats, which obviously enhanced the experience, but if you can afford any of the wet seats you should go for them!"
O,"I loved O!!! Ive seen it twice, have the picture book and the soundtrack is great for when your chilling in traffic. Beautiful, magical, and awesome!"
O,Bravo this truly was the best cirque du soleil I have seen in Vegas and yes I did go to the others tickets pricey but a must see performance was very magical dont go cheap get tickets ahead of time and make sure there in the first 8 rows
O,"I would have to say that of the 4 Cirque du Soleil performances (O, Love, Mystere and Zumanity) that I have seen, I enjoyed O the most.  My attention was captured from beginning to end.  While it didnt have the over abundance of acrobats, clowns, props, etc. as the other shows I have seen, the smaller cast of O gave a very big performance.  You will not be disappointed and afterwards, you will want to see it again as I would like to do."
O,Got tickets somewhat in the middle second section and it was amazing! I wish my seats were closer but even though where we were was just perfect! This show just cannot be put into words! It is absolutely amazing in everyway! The whole time i was in complete awe like I was a little kid in a candy store and couldny keep up with all that was going. Simply Beautiful! Would love to go experience again!
O,O my goodness how did they do it? The pool/!stage I am still in awe.  After spending over 100 dollars a ticket to see Chris Angel at Luxor I was very hesitant to be excited to see a show but you should be! Awsome!
O,"When planning a Vegas trip, O was my first reservation.  I wanted to see O for the last year and this was my chance, so I was really looking forward to it.

O was very good.  We dressed up, and we found that most of the crowd around us dressed up as well.  I like high flying acrobatics, and this show has plenty of acrobats flying through the air and landing in water.  It was a lot of fun!

The stage is huge.  Id recommend paying more for the tickets on the lower deck to have an easier time seeing the action.  The best parts of the show had to do with the changes in the stage from deep water to solid surface. Some of the routines looked a lot like cheerleading, which is fine.  The female performers were the centerpiece in O, much more so than in KA or Mystere.  There were moments when we said, How is that humanly possible?? which is the sign of a great Cique show.  I also liked the guy on fire, it added a nice touch.  

After waiting a year to see it, I wasnt disappointed at all!  Great show."
O,Not to be missed!!!  Any Cirque du Soleil show is worth the $$$$.
O,"this was my first cirque du soleil show. 

OUTSTANDING!
AMAZING!
SUPERB!
EXCELLENT!

i was just so amazed at the production! i was totally immersed by the show!

i highly recommend it!!!!"
O,"Deserve a 10 star for this outstanding performance and stage props and all the acts! Amazing million dollar stage with 6 feet deep water that turns into a flat/walk-able stage within seconds! Loved it! Buy tickets ahead of time, constant sold-out performance! Definitely go see it, its by far, my favorite Cirque production!"
O,"Unbelievalbe! If I even attempt to write a review about this show it would be a great disservice. No words can describe the authenticy and art of this show. Ive seen Mystere (Remarkable) and KA (Outstanding), but I must say that O is probably the best one.  Wont be disappointed at all, it is a must see!"
O,"One word: Surreal!
Several words: Spectacular acrobatics &amp; gorgeous scenery.  My mind went from back and forth from imagination to disbelief and awe.  This show immerses you in an entirely different world for an hour and a half.  Here, anything is possible.  The beautiful is seamlessly blended with the bizarre and grotesque.  At every moment theres ten more details deserving of attention than you can pay attention to.  The logistics of the space are amazing as well--if you look up you can see some of the huge machinery that makes this all possible, and the submerging/emerging wet-dry stage is one of a kind.  I was lucky enough to sit in the splash zone and I would do it again!"
O,Loved it! Went with friends and enjoyed the artistry and creativity!  If youre not a fan of Cirque du Soleil the incredible divers and contortionists might change your mind.  Out of our group there was only one hold out.  She said she is not a circus fan and it was too artsy.  Dare I say she is a self proclaimed red neck so this was just not her thing.
O,"The is the first Cirque show Ive seen but I was pretty blown away by it.  The acrobatics, the water stunts, the very cool and dynamic stage, the costumes... all fantastic, and I thought the music was PHENOMENAL.  The musicians are in two glass booths off to the side and there were times when I would just look over at the female vocalists because their voices were amazing, almost hypnotic.  A very immersive experience although at the same time just a touch frustrating because the plot is difficult to follow, and I think thats by design.  Price was a little steep at $170/seat but we had a great view.  Still a lot of fun and definitely recommended."
O,"Ive seen many Cirque du Soleil.  According to many individuals, O is considered one of the best.  However, I would like to disagree.  I expected a lot more from O considering that the cost compared to other cirque du soleil shows.  Dont get me wrong.  I was impressed by some of the acts, but what I was most impressed was the stage (how it transitions seamlessly from water to stage and vice-versa).  The show can be slow at times (the intermission with the clowns is quite boring).  I didnt buy my tickets in advanced, so I had to buy tickets with limited view.  My advice is DONT.  Youre not saving much money if any, and the view is terrible especially when the lights on stage shined right at you (upper session).   Not only can you not see the acts but youre blinded by the lights.  They should have designed the seating better.  I went to see Le Reve, which is a similar show, and every seats is a great seat.  I actually believe that Le Reve is a better show than O."
O,Ive seen pretty much every Cirque that Vegas has to offer and this one is right up there with Love.
O,"My group paid $200/ticket, but sat center, 3rd row from stage..designated wet seats. I dont think anyone really got wet though, except for a few slight drips here and there, but thats probably for the better...now on to the show.
   Of Cirque shows, Ive only seen Mystere so far, and am anxiously awaiting my next Vegas trip so I can watch Ka.  Anyway O is definitely amazing.  Like Mystere and other similar gymnastic type shows, you cant really describe the show itself. Theres just so much going on at the same time, and its hard to follow. But from what  I understand its about one mans journey through the mystical world of O that I guess involves a lot of water.
  The costumes, gymnastics, dancing, music, singing, diving, fire shows, everything was amazing.   Well except for pricing of snacks and drinks, but thats normal at a show (especially being at Bellagio).  The pricing is high for your typical show, but its about on par for Cirque shows, but do buy early. We bought our tickets about two months in advance, and we still had to get the good seats from a scalping website. 
   As some have said, O is a little more traditional, and can seem a little slow at times, but its still a very good show. The two clowns who have small little performances in between I assume set changes and etc...were very funny.  One of the clowns Ay ya ya and his little laughs, had my group and I reciting it over and over again =). I must say though that the complexity of the stage (the 1.5 million gallon pool) that becomes land and water w/in seconds is amazing.  I highly recommend this show.  
~G"
O,"Crazy, creepy and cool!  Dang you must go.  We sat in the 3rd row, but I think just about anywhere in the place was a good seat.  Even up a little higher you may see a bit more because there is tons of stuff (mostly strange stuff) going on."
O,"i had a chance to see this O Show when i was in vegas couple years ago. the tickets were paid off by my cousins, so basically it was a treat for me to join. the show was definitely stunning especially when we see people flying in midair.  this i believe is the only show ive been to in vegas, other then chinese concerts and/or that treasure island outdoor performance. 

if you have the money, time, and chance, be sure to buy tickets to enjoy this show"
O,"Really an amazing technological production - the stage is amazing, the acts here are so creative.  You cannot go wrong with Mystere or O in Las Vegas - these are the top of the top shows in Vegas.  The standby line in the Bellagio never fails to produce tickets to those who are patient, even for those nights that they claim they are sold out."
O,"For the most part, a great show. 2 complaints - (1) the clowns were just plain creepy not funny, (2) it ran a little long and tends to get repetitive at the end. You can only see someone do the same flip so many times before it stops being impressive."
O,"There are no words to describe this show. Its totally crazy, insane, and incredible. As far as I can tell there are no bad seats. Could have done w/o the clowns, but they have a minor part. Go."
O,"Phenomenal!!!  By far the coolest thing I found in Vegas!  There must be 85 people in that show -- clowns, dancers, acrobats, singers, musicians, SCUBA divers -- and it is choreographed beautifully!  Like everything, I guess, the show is bigger in Vegas.  The water adds a whole new element and level of complexity to Cirque!  I just loved it.  And it is perfect to go outside and watch the Bellagio fountains before and after.  A great evening!"
O,"Not as good as Ka or Mystere, but worth seeing.  Not as much variety as I would like.  I can only be entertained by people diving into water for so long.  Loved what they did with the curtain at the end."
O,I was duly impressed. The show was FANTASTICALLY AMAZING!!! I swear I spent over 90% of the time sitting at the edge of my seat trying to drink in all the sights and sounds. There was constantly something happening on the stage and off the stage. The pools design was impressive. i kept trying to figure out what kind of engineering/architectural requirements would be needed to achieve the various effects. the music was awsome. the various acts were just .... well... amazing.
O,THIS SHOW IS AWESOME! The best seats are in the back orchestra because you have something super cool above you in the beginning of the show. Its a show that is very hard to describe unless youve seen it. Tickets are OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive but seriously worth every penny. Go see this show!
O,"I saw O, Mystere, and Zumanity;  out of those three I like this one the best.  I felt that this one was the most creative in terms of how they open up the act and its usage of water.  I had front row seats so that was nice.  Since I saw this show first, Mystere and Zumanity ended up only average for me."
O,"This show was like a Dali painting come to like but with people. So many incredible things going on and whatever you happen to fix your attention to youre blown away by. Expertly choreographed and skillfully executed. I was anxious at times by the death defying antics of the performers, soothed at others by the music and artistry of the sets but at the end impressed by everything. The set is incredible with a large pool that appears and disappears. The performers were mind blowing. They swim, jump, twist and dance all over the place. The diving was what was most impressive to me, but I dont want to ruin it for anyone. If you get a chance, go see this."
O,"This was quite possibly the most beautiful thing Ive seen.  It was just beyond your imagination.  It feels like a sensory overload, you must be 100% on it, theres so much going on.  I wont give out any details, just see it, its priceless!"
O,Not as good as my all time favorite Mystere but it definitely comes to a really close second. The acrobatics and effects will leave you in awe. There are some really slow parts that made me almost sleep. all in all it is a great show and you will get good value for your money.
O,"We were pretty excited about seeing O especially after have already see Mystere and Ka.  We had pretty high expectations for this show, and it just didnt live up to them.  We both left the show with a wasnt nearly as good as we thought it would be feeling.  This cirque show has a lot more emphasis on water, and of course the staging was done beautifully, however the acrobats were not as good as we expected when comparing to others, like Mystere or Ka.  It seems that most yelpers prefer O to other shows, but we saw Mystere at half the price and would prefer it to O any day of the week!"
O,"This was my 2nd time to visit the show and it exceeded my expectation again. Some acrobats were not as impressive as others, but the stage sets, the music, the costume, the choreography...everything matches and creates the totally magical artistic fair.

Yes, it is expensive, but I would say it is still the best show in LV."
O,"This was a good show, I think I just expected more from all the hype. It was good, It was entertaining, and great talent. If there was a story line, I didnt get it, and I expected a little bit more wow factor. I am glad we saw it, it just was not as spectcular as the hype."
O,amazing show.. we had amazing seats.. spectacular view.. its a water based cirque du soleil show.. and u definitely wont regret it. watch it!!
O,"It is a 4 star show, not a 5 star.  Even though the O show is pretty good, I think it is a bit overrated.  It is one of the earlier Cirque du Soleil show, so it was the best, but not anymore.  Still good, but just not THE best.

The performance I watched had quite a few flaws actually.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and counted it a one-time my bad luck type of deal, so didnt take stars off for that.

Cirque du Soleil offers different types of performance.  Some offers huge props and settings and some focus on performers skills.  I compared O with KA.  Both offers huge proprs.  O is unique with water and KA uses sand.  I personally like KA better.

O seems to have quite a few repeated (or very similiar) acts.  The last clown scene was simply boring."
O,"This is the third Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen, and hands down, its the best one.  I had heard people rave about this show, but didnt believe them, so I had to see for myself.  And I do admit, everything they said is true.  The performers, production set, costumes, music...everything about it was excellent.  The concept of performing in and out of water was extremely intriguing to me.  Fortunately, we sat fourth row (center) from the stage, and left the show dry, unlike the people in the rows ahead of us.  The tickets were expensive, but definitely worth it for a one-time experience!"
O,"A must see.  If there is one Cirque du Soleil show to see, this is it.  It is amazing from an acrobatic and visual level.  Basically there is a large pool of water below most of the acts.  The level of the pool can rise and fall throughout the show.  Instead of a flip landing on the stage, the acrobat dives into a pool.  Most of the acrobats are not just doing flips and tumbles like the normal circus but the are doing the same tricks on moving apparatuses.  It is amazing.  The show is so popular that the only tickets I could purchased were the view partially blocked.  This wasnt bad because this is simply the bar for the stairs that is in the way.  Definitely book before you go to Vegas as this show is coming sold out and has a very long stand by line."
O,"This is a nice show. The show doesnt really have a storyline, but it keeps you entertain with all the stunts. Nice dream like decor/settings that compliments the music. Several different type of performances from acrobats, high diving in the water to a guy on fire. Well done production and performers are amazing at what they do. I would say I am not a show type person, but if you go to one, O is a decent choice."
O,"I splurged when I got tix for this show, you know its Vegas and all, might as well go big. However $150 per ticket plus a $20.00 Las Vegas entertainment fee per ticket made me say ouch but show was amazing and seeing it on a grand scale stage in Vegas made the experience even more wonderful."
O,Must see i know that the tickets mught be alittle pricy but it is worth it. I enjoyed every second.  It was crazy what they did and being this my first Cirque show i was super impressed.  I hope that all try this out.  I am just saying the tricks that they do and the fact that most is in or over water is pretty crazy.
O,Best place to see cirque du soleil is where it can be permanently set up  and the staging here is second to none. You could view this over and over again and still see something new each time. Not really my scene took the gf for valentines gift and the prices are extortionate but worth it in all honesty
O,"Once I had experienced Le Reve at the Wynn, I didnt think anything could compete.  I love Cirque performances.  At first when the show started I thought I was going to be bored.  But after a bit it got very exciting.  And my family and I were soon captivated.  I noticed some reviewers were not impressed with O, but I did enjoy it very much and would recommend it.  I do agree it doesnt start out with a bang but it does become more captivating as time goes on.  I gave it four stars only because the beginning isnt as exciting as Le Reve.  Thumbs up for O."
O,I was highly disappointed in this show...this is the most expensive Cirque show and i walked out of it early. It bored me...if you like sychronized swimming this one is for you. I seen way better stunts in KA and Zumanity. This is probably good for the kids.
O,Really good show like always but not as good as zumanity of course their totally different things but it just wasnt as entertaining or really in syc. Some parts of the show were just totally irrelevant.
O,I had such high expectations.  This show is a bit repetitive and I found myself getting a little bored.  Not that entertaining for kids.  If I had to do it over Id pick a different Cirque show.
O,We sat at the middle toward the front and really enjoyed this show. I saw Le Reve last year but thought that O is more beautiful and less boring in terms of the background settings. Le Reve is good in terms of the technicality of the gymnasts performance. O has more of a variety in terms of scenery
O,"Wow, what an amazing show!  Daring stunts, a crazy tricked out stage that turns into waterl, beautiful special effects and lighting, hilarious clown acts....I was super impressed with O.  I highly recommend it. It was my second Cirque du Soleil show.  I heard the other Vegas Cirque shows are also good, but I can definitely see what all the rave surrounding O is about. You have to see it!  (Just to paint a better picture of my experience - I sat in section 103 Row K...you actually might get a little wet if you sit in Row A or B)."
O,"Fantastic Show! We were lucky enough to secure front row seats to this show. I can only say I was overwhelmed almost all the time and the visual, audio, and impact in terms of the content they wanted to show us was always present. There were no breaks in between but you wont need one anyways since you will probably forget about time. It passed pretty fast for us. We liked the bits and pieces they put in. The Acrobatic performances were very, very nice to see in person. After I over heard that they change their performance from time to time ... I would pay the price again to see this show again ... totally worth the time to see this !"
O,"I am going to write the review that I wish was on here when I was deciding which of the cirque shows I was going to plunk down my hard earned dinero for. I could not decide between O, Ka, and Mystere....so I did the only logical thing and saw all 3. The wife and I had virtually the same feelings about all three shows. Ka was our least favorite. It was the only one where we wished we had our money back. This show is supposedly more about story line and less about acrobatics.  I would say its definitely less about both. There were many times when I found myself fighting off falling asleep (and I went to the early show), and only a couple of WOW moments. Mystere was our next favorite, and mainly about acrobatics. It was very classic old time Cirque. I enjoyed the show, but it did not feel new or fresh to someone like me that had already seen a few of their shows. And as youve already surmised if you are still reading this, our heads and shoulders above the rest favorite was O. The elaborate stage, the amazing stunts, and the stunning effects were awesome. There is a reason why this is the most expensive of the cirque shows (ticket price-wise) and why they dont ever seem to be available at tix4tonite. The show was captivating from the first moment, and so awe inspiring that I just bought four more tickets, so that our kids could share the experience with us this time around. So, if you are only going to see one cirque show while in Vegas, make O your choice. You will walk out happy to have spent some big bucks on something worth every penny."
O,"Wasnt impressed by this show and even slept through part of it. I saw another cirque du Soleil show at Suffolk Downs a few years back that was much more entertaining. I have to give the performers credit though, the acrobatics and diving were pretty cool."
O,"I loved the show, but mostly because of its uniqueness. The acrobatics were great, but not better then other Cirque du Soleil shows that i have seen. The amazing stage allows such unique acts with water that the audience is simply in awe for most of the show. The only thing that could have been done better were the clown acts. The clowns were not very funny, nor sad, they were just blah. If you are in Vegas, this is the number one destination, bar none."
O,"I have seen all the Cirque shows in Vegas and several of the traveling versions.  O suffers from over-expectations I think.  I expected it to surpass all the others, but it was just on par with them I felt.  It wasnt a bad show, just wasnt incredible.  Love and Mystere I feel are incredible....O and Ka are very good, just not great.

The O theatre is gorgeous and the highlight of the night may just be the giant red curtain disappearing into the back of the stage revealing the beautiful water beneath at the start of the show.  

Mystere is filled with incredible acrobatics, Ka is a stunning engineering feat and almost feels like a movie, Love is a massive party that exhilirates the senses, and O I feel is like a ballet.  Its beautiful in design and musical performance, but wont blow you away with any acrobatics, the stage movements are ok, and the energy is nowhere near as high as Love.

If you love the grace and refined sophistication of a ballet, you will love O.  If you want something to get you out of your seat or have you talking about it for the rest of the night, I would pass.  One last comment...if you eat a heavy meal before the show, you will struggle to stay awake I think at points.  At least our group did.  I would recommend seeing the show before dinner."
O,"I was disappointed, to say the least. The excitement wore off after 30 minutes when the stunts continued to be mediocre and I kept wishing for more.... I was bored. The water aspect seemed fun but it really inhibited the type of stunts they did. There was mostly diving and synchronized swimming.  The diving is nothing to boast about, they just did standard flips in the air or struck a pose on the way down.  There were some acrobats but it also seemed standard.... a couple of flips or turns....stuff youd see taught in an intermediate training school.  There really werent any Wow! moments.  Not worth $150. Maybe more like $50."
O,"absolutely amazing show! definite must see! everything was fantastic...the music, the acts, the effects, and the great usage of water. simply entertaining from start to end."
O,"We were just in Vegas and saw 4 shows: Mystere, Le Reve, O and Criss Angel-Believe. While theatrically beautiful and some amazing moments, its definitely not all that its hyped up to be. Way too expensive to make it worth it and a lot of boring moments. Mystere was by far the best! Maybe not the most theatrically intricate etc, but definitely the most entertaining."
O,"Believe it or not, I fell asleep both times I saw this amazing show which is well done, but couldnt keep me up at the late hour with lots of acrobatics and no dialogue."
O,"Amazing, amazing show.  Its like everything you can just dream about, they make it happen in O.   I appreciate the intricate details of the entire show, down to the color of the costumes, the way the curtain pulls up, the (sometimes) live singers also in costume, clowns makeup, stage backdrops...I loved it all.  That on top of the obvious world class talent of the performers and the direction of the show (such as, in some acts, where do the swimmers go after they have dove in, because they dont come back...makes you wonder just how incredible the pool/stage is engineered).

Truly, Ive seen 5+ different Cirque shows and this FAR outperforms the rest.  Not that I wouldnt give 5 stars to all the other shows from Cirque, but this sets the bar incredibly high.  Like others have said, since seeing this show, NOTHING else in Vegas can compare and its hard to even appreciate other Cirque land based shows."
O,"Love, love, LOVED it!!!  exactly what i expected from a cirque du soleil show.  the set was AMAZING.  the talent was EXTRAORDINARY.  even the clown filler was cute &amp; funny.  worth every last penny.

i would highly recommend saving your pennies to come to vegas rather than going to kooza or any traveling show.  when the set has to be packed up and hauled around, there are just limitations to how great it could be.  

something to note: there is no intermission.  oh also, like others have commented, the only small critique is that there are too many moving parts.  there is so much going onstage at any one time, you kinda get cross eyed trying to see everything.  8)"
O,"I agree with Hope and Justin. I watched it last night for the first time and its just good for me. If you are into those acrobatic and diving things you might like it more. I sat at the balcony level in the corner so I agree that its not quite a good spot to watch the show. The best seat will be the center balcony seat because there were so many things going on at once so it would be best to watch the show in the big picture. My first choice was KA but my friends had seen it so we went for the O. We all agreed that it was just good not great. At one point, I fell asleep because to me the show was repetitive some how. I would give it a Four if they had a better story line to follow, again, my friends and I agreed."
O,"This was my very favorite Vegas Cirque show until I saw Ka. Everyone needs to see this.

I cant figure out how they do it, but thats part of the fun. 

We couldnt get tickets and had to stand in standby for an hour. That was a drag. Five minutes in to the show we got to the front of the line. They cant tell you where the tickets are, so you take your chances. We turned out to get aisle center orchestra seats because the planted audience members that turned out to be part of the show were occupying these seats. Yay!

Dont hestitate."
O,"This is the best show I have seen in Las vegas, I had a side view seat and wish I had spent more for the center area but still loved the show, it looked like the balcony seats were really far back the theater is huge,  one thing I did not like was there was so much going on at times it was hard to catch it all, but that means I just have to keep going back again every time Im in vegas and that is my plan."
O,"Was so looking forward to seeing this show and with so many positive reviews on this show I regret having to give it only two stars.   I initially wanted to only give it one star but the acrobatics and diving routines bumped it up a star. They were great.   However,  I have one word to describe the theme of this show MACABRE.   This show will give you nightmares.   Would not recommend you bring your children.   Several characters were dressed like the grim reaper.   The set back looks like a representation of Hades.   Women that come out of the water look like dead zombies.   During one sketch a man sits on stage completely on fire.   Another scene has characters pulling a coffin on stage.   Another sketch has a big bell with macabre music playing  and the bell wringing insinuating your time is up.   It goes on and on.   I get shivers just writing about this show.   Way too overpriced.   Ive seen Cirque Du Soleil Ka and Love and they were both outstanding.   This one is just plain sinister.   Yuck!!!"
O,My favorite Cirque du Soleil show. Beautiful. I liked the music enough to buy a soundtrack.
O,No theatrical focal points like Love.  Love was a piece of theatre not just a bunch of circus acts.  O was totally unfocused with sooooo much potential to WOW us.  Very disappointed in this show.  Any theatre person should feel this way.  This show is a mess and needs to be re blocked with some kind of order.
O,"Saw 3 Cirque shows in the span of 4 days - Love, Zumanity and O. They were all so different = this one was the most cirque-esque - meaning it had the typical acrobatics and high flying stunts. I loved the water aspect which adds a whole new dimension. We sat in 203, row V (i think) and the seats were PERFECT so you can see the high flying stunts. I really enjoyed this show and would watch it again! No audience participation except for the entertainment at the beginning - the people that are pulled from the audience were performers meant to look like audience members so that was a bit of a let down but once you see what they do, it makes sense. LOVED this show at the Bellagio - WATCH IT!"
O,"Simply amazing and beautiful... well worth whatever price you choose to pay... we sat third row and saw every nuance in the performers faces, but honestly I often felt that there was so much to see at once that I would rather have sat further back... the water-based show needs to be seen to be understood... images that still haunt me: the man that sits in a chair, reading a newspaper, on fire... for five minutes, while the show goes on around him... on fire... amazing... then there is the woman who balances on her head... on a swinging trapeze... 30 feet abive the water... again, amazing... or the haunting piano player that slowly sinks into the abyss... only took one star away for the clowns... they are tedious... all in all, see this show... it is the truest expression of the beauty, poetry, and artistry the human mind and body are capable of..."
O,"Absolutely incredible!  Yes tickets are very expensive (actually very expensive is an understatement) but this show is so worth it.   Do not be afraid to get the cheap seats.  I sat in Section 203 Row R Seat 20, it was the cheapest seat in the house and it said there was a limited view.  Honestly, nothing was blocking my view and the people right next to me paid $50 more than me for the exact same view!  Get the seat I have, you will not be dissapointed.  It is my second favorite cirque next to Ka.  Go early because the theatre is gorgeous.  The costumes, lighting, stage, characters, etc.  Everything was exceptional and I was taken to another world for an hour and a half.  O is absolutely amazing and a must see in vegas if you have the money to do so."
O,"Really. Really. Booooring. Beautiful to look at, but i wanted more acrobatics and entertainment. Too artsy for my taste."
O,"This is the 4th Cirque show that I have seen.  I wouldnt say it was the best, but it certainly would rate #2.  I wouldnt select seats on the floor.  I would go up a level to see everything going on."
O,"i was not impressed with o. i guess there was just too much hype. o was my 5th cirque show and it is probably in the bottom half of all the cirque shows i have seen. the only thing that amazed me about the show is how quick they can move the water, and thats it. story line was meh, acrobats were meh. i started to think all resident shows must suck as i also saw la nouba several years back in orlando and it was the worst of all that i have seen.  we also saw mystere this time and i thought mystere was better than o.  so, not all resident shows suck.  i understand the upkeep of the stage with all the water etc, but at $150 a pop, i dont think the show is worth it."
O,"I had pretty high/far seats for this show - maybe it was the seats, but I didnt enjoy the show much.  Many tricks are best seen where you can see the surface of the water, but I was so high that I could see into the water, and that ruined some of the fun.  But I would prefer if the show had a storyline; there is no storyline intended.  Tough to justify the cost here.  I did see Ka at MGM and I *REALLY* enjoyed that one."
O,"it is not worth the money.  nothing special about the show, if i can give no start, id give no star.  theres absolutely nothing to rave about."
O,"The show is totally worth the money.  I bought loggia tickets during spring promotion (buy one ticket and the second one for $25), and I had pretty good view.  The show was fabulous.  All the diving and acrobat was really impressive.  The music was also really good.  I didnt really like the clowns all that much, but they are somewhat entertaining, I guess.  One biggest negative of this show is its lack of storyline.  The whole show was dreamlike and had abstract connection."
O,"Ive never been to a Cirque show before, so we decided to go for it when we came to Vegas.  Let me preface this review by saying that I HATE clowns!  To the point of panic attacks.  We sat stage right, so we were in a clown-free zone.  *whew*  I will admit that the one was actually kind of cute... from a distance.  So, besides the creepy clown factor, I loved the show.  I thought the costumes and set were incredible.  I have no idea how they pulled it all off.  Seriously?  The guy on fire?!   The amazing acrobats who could also dive and synchronized swim?!  I am so happy that we splurged to come to this show!  One of the top two things we did on our trip (Valley of Fire being the other).  We did the dinner package with Circo.  I wish we had just done the dinner separately because they menu through Cirque wasnt quite as inventive as their regular price fixe and they were both about the same price.  Minor detail.  The seats were a bit tight, but we had tiny people on either side of us, so we were fine.  I felt bad for the woman in front of us though.  She was sharing half of her seat with the gal next to her."
O,"Ill tell you this must at first to lure you into my review...The show was so good I later bought the program and the CD so I could relive the experience another day. O reallys captivates everything that Id imagined about a Cirque de Soleil performance. It has its elements of circus with the clowns and crazy costumes and face-painting, but also true elegance and creativity with devices such as the customized water/stage, motorized ceiling platform, props, and the number of devices for the performers to fly/jump/hang on/off of. The O theatre is situated within the Bellagio, one of the most impressive works of construction Ive ever seen in my life. The show doesnt fail to meet that level of impress. Just the anticipation of the show to begin is exciting, the theatre is enormous and every inch beautiful, above you is an Oval Shaped Mounting with a Crazy Swirl in the center (architectural detail/part of the show?), and Red Curtain Wall seems magical covering up whatever sights lie behind it. Plush seating allows you to recline and we had one the best views around from seats Q13 and Q14 of Section 203 which is smack-dab in the middle of the audience. REVIEW: Dont try to follow the story...just take in all the amazing feats these super-fit humans do before your eyes. Its really incredible to see that these guys and gals can actually do all this things so seemingly  flawless-like. Diving, Contourshunning, Holding of Breathe, Swimming, More Diving, Swinging, but most important of all ENTERTAINING. The WOW factor is definitely seen. You begin to love the 2 clowns of the show and wish you were the Magical Eery Conductor. One day I hope Youll see what I mean."
O,"All right, I hardly leave reviews less than 5 stars, so this is hard for me to do. I had read a lot of hype around this show and have seen several other Cirque shows in  and out of town. Tickets for O are more expensive as the show, which has been running for 11 1/2 years now, is considered the creme of the crop. I just couldnt get into this show. The storyline was difficult, if not impossible to follow. Was there even a story here? The acrobatics were good, and the water acts were also good, but not awe inspiring as Ive come to expect (and have been spoiled) from Cirque shows. I went to Beatles Love recently and loved that show. The cost of Beatles Love was also much more affordable. I really really wanted to like O, so Im a little down leaving this review, but there are plenty of other positive reviews and people that love it, so Im in the minority on this one. I just wanted to be honest. The person I went with and quite a few people around me expressed similar sentiments to mine after the show, so felt compelled to review. Good luck regardless!"
O,"Loved it! When I head back out to LV, Im definitely going to see it again! This is an incredible show for the entire family. The clowns are super funny and the show is amazing!"
O,"Ive been wanting to check out O for years, and it did not disappoint.  The water stage pushed acrobatic elements to another level.  The live music was well composed."
O,I love this artsy fartsy Cirque du Solei about dreams.  Its a fabulous show centered around water.
O,"One of the best shows in Las Vegas. Worth the money they are charging. I didnt buy the best seats but my view was wonderful.  It was artistic, funny, beautiful stage and costumes, very talented performers....simply amazing."
O,O is the best Cirque du Soleil show ever.  From the opening of the red curtain to the curtain call this show is non-stop entertaining action.  Totally worth the price of admission.  We sat fairly close but I dont think that there is a bad seat in the house.  If you can only see one show in LV this should be it.
O,"After seeing KA, I might have had expected too much from O. I liked it a lot, but I am still debating whether I liked better than KA or not.  A must see regardless in Vegas."
O,"Amazingly good show!  We really enjoyed the water/stage mix and the entire show had us on the edge of our seats.  Talented, sexy people doing outrageous things!  A lot of fun."
O,"we caught the 10:30pm sunday show of O and all i can really say is wow...  it was my 1st cirque du soleil show...  there was just so many things to see that were all happening at the same time...  we sat the left of the stage, 2nd row so we were really up and close to the stage...  which in my opinion was equivalent to watching tv, right in front of your face...  if we sat a few rows back we probably could have caught everything much better...  but none the less the synchronized swimming, the dives, acrobatic movements, the costumes, the fire circus, the clowns, the acting, the live music was on point and very entertaining...  i would definitely have to watch O again, but after i catch some of their other shows first...  h-100..."
O,Top notch show.  Amazing athletes and performers.  Highly recommend this show to anyone who comes to Vegas!
O,And 5 more stars if I could I have seen every cirque show and by far o was the best one my seats where 2 row dead middle would go to this show every time Im in sin city especially the way the stage goes up and down and and when the stage is down its a pool beyond a must see for sure
O,"Okay. I have seen a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows, and they can seem repetitive. I understand that the performers are truly talented, but the shows are similar to one another. However, O breaks the mold. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire show, and I did not want it to end. The water was a great place for the acrobats to do their stuff, and the costumes were fantastic. After further investigation, I found out that the costumes were all specially made with specialty fabrics/paint so that they would last even longer than normal in the chemical-laden water, and the tank that the performers were swimming/dancing in had an elaborate underwater speaker system which included cues for dancing sections, etc. I know that this is no surprise, since the show is very technical and cannot afford any mistakes, but it still blows me away. I would definitely go again, but would recommend getting the half-price tickets the same day as the show - definitely worth the wait in line/trip to the box office."
O,"Be ready to embark on a journey captivating all your senses. If youre visiting Las Vegas and enjoy a unique and one of a kind show, then you must see O. Inspired by the idea of infinity and the pure shape of the letter O, the name of this production derived from the French word eau, meaning water, the shows theme. Like other Cirque du Soleil productions, O presents a mélange of performers and skills. Here the mix includes aerial acts, clowns, fire-jugglers and a host of swimmers and divers. The stage Cirque du Soleil created for O could almost be numbered among the shows stars. One minute its dry land and the next its all water, deep enough to catch the divers who launch themselves from high up in the stage rigging. Franco Dragone broke all molds of theatre and production when he created this masterpiece. I have personally seen several Cirque du Soleil productions and seen other shows, but nothing comes close to this: The costumes are amazing; the stunts are well coordinated and leave you on the edge of your seat. I guess what overall did it for me is how visually stimulating it was to watch and how the music, water and human beings can work in an environment that plays with your emotions. This is a story that uses symbolism and metaphors to be a modern day beauty and the beast type of love story.

O,"awesome production, totally vast stage and performance. too bad they dont have all the sound tracks recorded, the only disappointing part to everything."
Zumanity,"Zumanity/CASANOVA! please read!

To the one of the best shows in Vegas! My wife (6 year local) and I (20 year local) have been to many shows, but your show by far has exceeded our expectations. We showed up on a friday, but in the middle of the show my wife wasnt feeling good and we had to leave. I was a little upset because we spent close to $400 on our tickets (VIP) and leaving half way through an awesome show sucked a little bit. My wife is someone who presents/briefs in front of a lot of people on a daily basis and she understands that it feels like shit when someone leaves in the middle of a performance. She was so upset thinking that the performers would notice that we left in the middle of the show and she felt horrible. She didnt want the performers to feel like they didnt do a good job. On the way out the door, one of the ushers asked us what was wrong and expressed concern. We told her the story and she told us to go to will call and see if they could get us new tickets. I didnt want to ask because we already watched half of the show, but we never splurge on VIP tickets, so I thought, why not? Lets give it a try. When we got to will call, the lady at the front desk was more than accommodating. She not only gave us tickets, but a better view than before and for the following day (Saturday). I couldnt believe it. The next day we showed up and the first act was a 15 minute comedy act with casanova. He immediately pointed us out realizing we were there the day before. He asked us what happened, expressing concern just like the usher. The next 30 minutes of the show made it one of the best shows in vegas. Not only did I get called onto stage, but he involved my wife and I in multiple comedy skits making our night. At the end of the show all of the performers and casanova were in line on stage and casanova looked at us and gave us a thumbs up, almost asking us if they did a good job. I couldnt really tell if my thumbs up and head nod was a good enough gesture to show that the show/performance was fucking amazing! I really hope the show lives on and I highly recommend
zumanity to any locals and visitors!"
Zumanity,"I am surprised by the negative reviews because I thought this show was amazing. You have to be comfortable with you sexuality (or at least be open to being comfortable with it) or this show will make you squirm. But its not just sex.... there is comedy as well.

I loooooved this show! From the second we sat down my husband and I were either laughing or eyes glued to the stage. We were in the second row so we had amazing seats. The sexual scenes were tasteful for the most part.... when they werent, they were hilarious. 

Brilliant production. Beautifully executed. I would definitely pay to see this again."
Zumanity,I am SO thankful my husband and I got these tickets for free. I would have been annoyed if we would have paid for this show. There were a handful of acts that were good but a lot of them were boring. Ive gone to several shows in Vegas and this one has been my least favorite. We actually got up and left before it ended. When you think of  Cirque du Soleil  you think AMAZING...this was not amazing. Save your money and go give another show a try.
Zumanity,"Unfortunately, I think this show is getting a bit played out. The performances were pretty good, but the dialogue and jokes were pretty tired, comparable to things a middle schooler would say. Were the outfits raunchy? Sure. The jokes, not so much. To be honest, I actually fell into a few micro-naps. Also, the effort to be inclusive to the LGBTQ+ community was pretty forced, they can do better. In terms of seating, the top front row has a bar that kind of obstructs the view. I could tell it was an issue for a lot of people. Not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind when selecting a seat. Overall, kind of a disappointing experience given the price tag."
Zumanity,"SO.  MUCH.  FUNNNN!  We attended this past Monday, as part of our 10th anniversary date night, and I dont think anything would have been more appropriate!  Rawr!  ;)    We both agreed, it is our favorite live show we have ever seen, and we have seen many.  It was the most perfect combination of classy stripping, comedy, burlesque, acro, classic Cirque style, vision and talent, and audience interaction.  Literally, the best version of adult entertainment - ever.

There is NO BAD SEAT in the entire house, so dont stress.  And it turns out, if the house is not filled, they will automatically upgrade the balcony seats to fill the floor, which is what happened to us.  100% if you are in the aisles or front rows, know that you are fair game for raunchy, hands-on (I mean, they will actually, put their hands on your bodies) potential embarassment (if you are shy or uptight).  We ended up on the red velvet couches and had a few moments of a cameo appearance! Oh and p.s., make sure you allow some time to poke around (no pun intended but Im just gonna leave that there anyway) the theater and lobby because there are fun hidden gems throughout (like peepholes in the plush walls buttons).

Pro tip:  There is no intermission, so plan your imbibement accordingly.  ;)

Grab a date and GO!  Youre welcome!"
Zumanity,"Another amazing Cirque show that is also very different.  This is an adult, over 18+ show and its kinda nice to have now and then!  Set inside New York casino, you walk into a dim theatre with red chairs.  The show is led by Mistress Edie of Sensuality and she has the most amazing voice.  Following this are amazing gymnastics, dances, and acrobatic acts.  The show is also slightly interactive where the cast comes to the audience now and then.  This is not only a sensual show, but also a very very funny one.  An amazing cast !"
Zumanity,"This show was amazing. I was enthralled the entire show. The aerial acrobats were stunning. 

Several acts were quite funny and engaging."
Zumanity,"Burlesque meets Cirque du Soleil. Dont come here if you are easily offended by nudity or sex jokes. Theres much more interaction with the audiences than your average Cirque show so stay away from the front sections (including the side front sections) if you dont want to be touched, called on or dragged up on stage. There is more comedy than other Cirque shows. The acts however were not as impressive than shows like O or KA. I saw LOVE during the same trip and it made Zumanity seem like a low budget production. I do like that the theater is much more intimate here. Overall, I didnt love the show but I did like it."
Zumanity,"Its a fun show, but know what youre buying tickets for before going.

I say this because it was very entertaining watching people squirm because they bought the family Cirque du Soleil tickets not really paying attention to the content or storyline. The grandmother next to us was definitely super uncomfortable and the guy on the other side was beet red at all the innuendos and simulated intercourse happening in front of him while his mother watched like a statue.

So yeah, its over the top sexual, but not pornographic. The most youll see is some boobs (both male and female), so no worries on seeing other parts if youre not okay with the human body. Its an 18+ show, so the jokes are on the raunchy side. I dont mind low-brow comedy, so I thought it was pretty hysterical. It caters to all sexual orientations and regardless of your preference, youll be in awe of whats in front of ya.

The pacing of the performance goes about 90-minutes without any breaks. Snacks and drinks inside the theater are on the high side, so its better to imbibe before or after. If youre sitting in the first two rows, theres a good chance youre going to be harassed and or brought up on stage for simulated stimulations.

There are always promotions going on for the show, but be sure to check out all those discount ticket kiosks on Las Vegas Blvd. to see what they have for that night.

Pro-tip. Back orchestra was the way to go. Not too cheap, not super expensive and the view was amazing. The theater is pretty small and intimate, so wherever you choose, its gonna be a fine seat."
Zumanity,Zumanity was a really awesome show to see while in Vegas.  I highly recommend paying extra tickets to be near the stage.  The performers were all amazing and there was an abundance of comedy during the show.  I really loved the pre-show entertainment.  This is a very sex positive show so if you are a bit prude I would recommend staying away.  I also do not know if I would recommend coming here with family members.  A mom got pulled up onto the stage and it turns out that she came with her 30-year-old son and the rest of the family.  For most people that would make the rest of the vacation a bit awkward seeing what they had her do :D
Zumanity,"Zumanity is impressive, hilarious, and just overall an awesome show that Id recommend to anyone who isnt shy about their sexuality and doesnt have plans to see it with their parents or kids (18+ show)! As other reviewers have also stated, the show is not for everyone, theres some nudity, but I felt as though the show was beautifully done with just the right amount of humor and jokes and it was not distasteful, which I feel like could be a thin line when anything related to sex/sexuality/nudity is involved. 

Caveat: if youre hoping to see insane acrobatics and such, Id point you to other cirque shows without a doubt. While zumanity has some pretty impressive tricks, it doesnt get close in terms of acrobacy to other cirque shows in Vegas."
Zumanity,"Phenomenal show. Ive been twice and it only got better. This is the risque style show and its done perfectly. Honestly the performances were so good I didnt even really pay attention to the risque elements. 

The seating is intimate with a small theater and centered stage. The performers frequently come through the audience so you definitely feel immersed in the happenings.  

The music is perfect and really draws out emotions and keeps your attention throughout. The costumes are mostly minimal but tastefully done. Youll see an array of acrobatics and feats that seem impossible. 

Overall: A+
Definitely one of the top Cirque shows and Id recommend it to anyone."
Zumanity,"We had a great laugh and overall fun time. Get the Mlife discount, pick up the tickets early from the box office, but preferably reserve online and print them out yourself. You have until 4 to get them same day as the show. Go early or face the afternoon lines.

At the show, we got the rose stickers from the usher, which keeps them from selecting you or your partner for the audience interaction parts. Probably didnt need it since we sat in the back and they never came towards us. Avoid the red couches in front of the stage and first few rows if youre shy. 

Someone on here mentioned no bad seats in the house. Unfortunately, for the 7:00 show we went to, they closed the balcony seating that we had reserved online. Probably because the house wasnt filled, which also meant free upgrades. So the nice ladies at the box office reassigned our seating towards the back on the lower level. Unfortunately, we chose the seats that were right next to the speakers  . So avoid either of the sides right by the stage.

Doors dont open until about 30 min before. I wouldnt recommend getting there until they open the doors because youll be standing up in line the whole time. The show was 90 min long so you should still get there early enough to use the potty beforehand. And there is a pre-show of sorts that you can take advantage of to get snacks, drinks and a quick dash to the bathroom.

I have seen other cirques before and enjoyed them. This one is admittedly not as impressive. It has a focus on aerial, contortionist and dancing acts and not much else. But if you dont go in expecting interesting or unique acts and skills like other cirque du soleil shows, youll come out laughing all the same. 

The bdsm one with the girl on ropes was a bit long, too serious and a bit off-putting with her fake gasps and pretending to choke herself until she stops moving. It was made to be the serious act with sad music so kind of a mood killer. But there was a fun guy in the audience who kept whooping and cheering whenever she did the drops on the ropes so he kept us laughing and in a good mood."
Zumanity,"This is by far, the best show in Las Vegas! 
Dont miss this show! 
The skill of the performers, the live orchestra, the live singers and the MC (edie or Axle) create an amazing show that wows 5 nights a week! 
The theater is a perfect size for all to enjoy the show. There are acts that fly through the air! So balcony seats are great too! 
This is an over 18 show! 
And definitely not for prudes! Haha 
Enjoy the show!!!"
Zumanity,"My Wife and I wanted to see a sexy show, the advertisement was very deceiving.  it was  65% of Slapstick comedy, badly dressed costumes, nothing really sexy about the show.  the girls in the bowl of water and the little person act were the best!  I spent $220 dollars for 2 tickets in a act that should be for a Road side Carnival.  the show was maybe worth $25 a seat and that would be upfront.   Cirque Du Soleil shows are usually great.  NOT THIS Show.    Cirque Du Soleil KA at MGM Grand, is the best show I ever seen!!  My wife and I loved it!  worth my over $200 dollars.  We Do Not recommend this show ZUMANITY IN LAS VEGAS New York New york to our worst enemy."
Zumanity,"Completely raunchy, outrageous and hilarious! Its safe to say we loved it. It has the capability of taking you out of your comfort zone if you are one of the chosen audience members to participate in some their skits. If you would like to avoid this, you may want to find a seat selection in the upper balcony, anyone one the floor is fair game! It was a great mix of sexuality, humor and acrobats that you would expect from a cirque de sole show. 

There is a strict no cell phone rule which is enforced, not even to check a message! Be prepared for red laser lights to be shined upon you if you dare to challenge this rule! Also the seats are pretty packed in with not a lot of arm space between you and your neighbor, so make friends quickly!  The chairs in the very front row are spacious, however comfort comes at a price.. you will be called upon or put on the spot. 

There is a pre show 15 minutes prior to show start which consists of cast members making there way through the audience and interacting with hilarious commentary. Again, no one is safe and no eye contact will not work!"
Zumanity,"This show was entertaining, full of talented performers, and very worth the money. Please go with an open mind, there will be nudity, and sexual content. The entire show was packed with fun, dancing, and hilarious jokes. This is great for a date night, to celebrate a special occasion, an outing with a group of friends, or even fun enough to check out solo!! All the seats in the venue have a good view of the stage so sitting higher up will not be a problem. Enjoy!"
Zumanity,"I wanted to do a Cirque du Soleil show while in Vegas but the prices are so crazy.  I picked the cheapest one and that happened to be Zumanity.  I am so glad that this ended up being the show because the previous (and much more expensive) Cirque show I attended was nowhere as good as this one.  The theater is pretty small so you have a good view wherever you sit. The show is sexy, funny, and very entertaining."
Zumanity,"Love Cirque du Soleil!! This is one of my favorite shows! Its so inclusive to all communities (LGBT), and the dancers/actors on stage are very engaging. I loved the performances and the live music. My favorite act was the 2 women swimming in the fish bowl together. Before I saw this show, I didnt really know what to expect. Ive seen their other shows before, but Zumanity seemed different compared to their other acrobatic shows. I was pleasantly surprised! This show has acrobatics, sensuality, story-telling, and amazing life music. I would def recommend this show to others!"
Zumanity,I have wanted to see a Cirque du Soleil show for a while and it didnt disappoint.  It started on time and kept the entertainment going until the very end.  The transition of the acts is very smooth and keeps you guessing whats next.  It is for the open minded.  From the audience participation to the acts its definitely not for anyone that is uptight.  I liked that the music and singers were live.  My only negative is I felt it could be a little longer for the price.
Zumanity,"I genuinely loved this show! It highlights sexuality and sensuality in such a positive light! Incredibly entertaining and uplifting, I would see this show multiple times. It would also be amazing if you guys could come to Chicago! We would love to have you. Keep up the amazing work that you are doing!!!"
Zumanity,"Undeniably the most sensual performance I have ever seen - on stage, TV or in person (haha). The amount of talent per sq. inch of the stage is unreal. The hostess is a drag queen whose stage name is Mistress of Sensuality - she is funny, bold and oh so enchanting. The music is passionate, the performers are enchanting and the acrobatics are insane. Everyone has an incredible body and when they are performing, they almost look powerful - oozing with sensuality and strength at the same time. There is some nudity but this show is all about being comfortable in your own skin. They show how incredible and perfect the human body is and what amazing things we can do with it. I was literally glued to my chair the whole time, never once took my eyes off the stage. Everywhere you look, there is something amazing happening. 

If you are in the first few rows, be ready to have a ball because they will pick you and call you on stage and make you do whatever the hell they want to - so be a sport and go up there and do whatevers asked of you as if no ones watching. It is truly amazing how they have incorporated elements of sensuality, comedy and naughtiness without being vulgar. 

If you are in Vegas, please make sure to get the tickets to this performance, because if you miss it, you will never know what true seduction really means. Worth every penny. Highly highly recommended."
Zumanity,"Hilarious, raunchy, high flying. Sensuality!! More fun than I expected. The mowhawk performer was unbelievable. Seamless transitions and beautiful dancers. The theater almost seems cliche and cheap but it invites you into another world. Audience participation and interaction a plus."
Zumanity,"Zumanity is another fabulous Cirque du Soleil show. Its based entirely on sexuality; wide range of sexuality so if youre not ready for it then be prepared to blush a lot. Its a great show to attend with your significant other. When we purchased the tickets, we were told that by being in the first row it was very likely that we would be picked on to participate in the show. I was hesitant but really wanted the first row. Amazingly, my friends and I dodged the bullet, but most people in first row seats were signaled out. Some were pulled onstage to participate in the show. The theater itself was smaller and more intimate than I had expected so the performers are right there in your face. The vocalists had beautiful, strong voices, and the acrobatics were amazing also. A great show for adults who have an open mind and arent afraid to explore their sexuality."
Zumanity,"Hum?  What to say?   I am very open minded and love sexy sensual shows.   The MC dude reminded me of Rocky Horror dude.  Didnt care much for him and his side kick womans voice sounded like fingernails on a chalk board.  
Loved:  the 2 sensual girls in the fish bowl!!!   Wish the show would have been more of them.
Loved the acrobatics and audience participation.  
Loved the live music and live singer.  The girl playing guitar was awesome.  
Some of the humor was too cheesy.  Reminded me of high school plays.  
If I could do over I would spend my $100 elsewhere."
Zumanity,Great cirque show with an adult spin. Similar to Absinthe. Not for prudes. More nudity than we expected but no problem. We sat front row in a love seat and were glad they didnt bring us on stage! Funny show. Entertaining!
Zumanity,"Wonderful show? Yes! But, it fell short after O. The woman and man act between the show was a little offputting. A little overdone to me. There wasnt much aerialist acts, and its not close to the Circ Du Soilel family as others. It was a good show, but I wish there were more aerialist action rather than people talking on and on and on."
Zumanity,"This show was absolutely spectacular! I am an instant fan and recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to have a good time and also sit back and enjoy something fun and completely different. Its a show where sexuality meets acrobatics meets comedy. This is an adult experience, so leave the kids at home thank you. Im pretty sure you wouldnt make it through the front door with your toddler anyway. If you had to pick just one Cirque du Soleil performance to complete your Vegas trip, PICK THIS ONE."
Zumanity,"Great show. Hugh drink prices, obviously. Very entertaining, audience participation does happen so yield to other warnings. 

Great music and great costumes. Would recommend buying tickets as advanced as u can."
Zumanity,"If youre looking for a Cirque du Soleil show, then this isnt the best one to see. I would save your money and get tickets for O instead. It is advertised as a risqué performance, but I was left more than underwhelmed - there was a lot of fluff and not many performances that stuck with me."
Zumanity,"The New York New York Hotel &amp; Casino is home to this sultry Cirque du Soleil show. Getting tickets wasnt a problem-they had many seats open the night we wanted to see the show and the ticket agents were friendly and helpful.  They have a concession stand outside of the theater that sells overpriced drinks and snacks. But hey, the customer service was great.

When we first entered the theater, I noticed that it was so much smaller in comparison to the other Cirque du Soleil shows. I later found out that it was meant to be this way because the show is interactive and it makes it more of an intimate venue for the performers to interact with the audience. 

Like other shows, the show begins before it really begins, if you know what I mean. Before curtain call, there were performers in costume mingling with the audience in the seating area. The most memorable were the overweight twins who were dressed burlesque-style. They walked through the rows and offered fresh strawberries while rubbing up (both of them were top and bottom-heavy) on audience members. They were hilarious.

If you havent already guessed or seen pictures, Zumanity is a very seductive show. Most know that no two Cirque du Soleil shows are similar but thats an understatement when it comes to Zumanity. Its definitely an adults-only show and gents may want to bring a change of clothes just in case. The show is filled with athletic and attractive performers. They bring many common fantasies to life including a sexy female duo  who both look naked (they wear nude, barely there bodysuits) diving in and out of a small pool of water, a nicely built male who performs aerial stunts while being chained, and even an on-stage orgy towards the end of the show with a huge group of performers. 

We had a great time at the show. The stunts were amazing, acts were hilarious and entertaining and it was a fun experience overall. The show isnt for everyone but you definitely dont need to be a nymphomaniac to enjoy it-just a great sense of humor and an appreciation for awesome performances. Oh, and at couple of Benjamins for tickets and refreshments."
Zumanity,"Definitely an adults-only performance because I just cant see myself explaining all the gyrations, nudity ( I thought women had pasties but no) and expletives. Leave the kiddies home and enjoy the naughty jokes, beautiful bodies , acrobatic spectacles, gyrating bodies and plush setting. All performances were beautiful and emcee kept us laughing."
Zumanity,"My husband and I really enjoyed this show and I am so glad we ended up booking it (last minute) while we were in Vegas! The performers were amazing, the host was hilarious and I just cant say enough positive things."
Zumanity,"Ive seen about 20+ shows in Vegas and this was tied at the bottom of the list with Criss Angel.  Absinthe is at the top of list, not counting concerts. The acrobatics were average, the MCs were subpar and not entertaining, the dancers below average and the whole flavor of the theme was tired and boring. I really wanted to see this our last several trips and was excited to go this time; we had great seats center stage about 5 rows back. However, we walked away feeling totally let down and disappointed."
Zumanity,"First let me say it was my birthday my wife decided to take me here as it was a cirque du Soleil performance. Dont go in expecting that. The auditorium is small so dont waste your money getting upgraded seats. The performers are talented but I felt a little sorry for them because I know that everyone needs to work to make a living. The show itself is very sexual in nature and although I have an open mind others may find it offensive. It would be better served if this show in particular was set in another location off of the strip. If you are easily offended by sex jokes or sexual Innuendos then the show is not for you. Personally I found this particular show to be lacking And was not up to par with Cirque du Soleil, as I have seen many of their performances in the past."
Zumanity,"Got free tickets from a mobile game I play by redeeming points. This show is located in New York New York and is pretty easy to find, just follow the signs. I would recommend arriving 15 min early so you can get in and find your seats. They do a little pre show entertainment. This show is very risque and is definitely 18+. Lots of female nudity, aka breasts lol. Theres a lot of joking around, personally I found it a little cringey but apparently my friends loved it so depends on the person. 

The acts were awesome, they were all very visually pretty. I would say compared to other cirque shows there wasnt quite as many acrobatic or gymnastic acts. Some got replaced with more burlesque-esque acts. If you get premium tickets you might get pulled into the show so be prepared for that!
 
I would recommend this show because I love cirque but if you want a more serious show or more technically intensive then you could leave this one till later. Just have proper expectations. Also very LGBTQIA+ friendly. Definitely good for a fun night out with date."
Zumanity,"Simply terrible.  Take your hard-earned money and go to any Cirque show in town other than this one. The host was just ok. The acrobatics were sub-par compared to other Cirque shows weve seen.  The performers all seemed to be just going through the motions of their routines.  And, the show abruptly ends with the host talking to the audience.  Just so disappointing."
Zumanity,"Absolutely a wonderful exploration in Sex as an art form. Amazing Preformers. The Men are simply DELICIOUS. The Women are beautiful to. But my Husband and I were more pleased in the Men. The friendly and Helpful Staff were great as well. I wish we were able to take pics of the Performance. Show is DEFINITELY A MUST SEE, while visiting here in Las Vegas"
Zumanity,"This show was so good! I will say that the theatre is so small and intimate that if you want to pay a smaller fee to sit in the back, you will still have a great time and be able to see the whole show clearly in the back. We made the mistake of paying $150 a ticket to sit in the front but realized our view was actually not that much better than anyone in the back or the balcony because the theatre is that small. If you are shy and dont want to be called up on stage DO NOT SIT NEAR THE FRONT. If you sit in the front seats, they will be calling you up on stage to do some funny and risqué acts. Overall, this show was hilarious and we laughed the entire time, along with being amazed by the beauty of the dancers and how eloquent everyone was. it is a very sexual, but tasteful show. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try something a little different!"
Zumanity,"Easily my least favorite Cirque show to date. This was Cirque meets cabaret, but its 30% Cirque and 70% cabaret. If youre into Cirque for the acrobatics or death-defying stunts, just skip this show all together. This show was mostly singing, slapstick comedy routines, and topless dancing. I was bored about half way through. For the price paid for front row tickets, there are much more affordable and higher quality alternatives for all three throughout the Vegas strip. This show may be less boring if youve a) never seen boobs and b) have never seen a Cirque show."
Zumanity,"Nicely surprised by the show!
Show is at 7pm and 9:30pm
I didnt care about it till my friend Loïc begged me to go with him!
Tips! If you are local they offer a discount at the box office but the best would be to go sign up for a free M life card, which gives you a discount as well.
Smaller theater but from wherever your are seated you see well. The seating is kind of in U shape (is that english? Lol)
The artists are beautiful and their performance is very sensual, sexy and elegant! I am always impressed by their performance.
The fun part is that if you buy a ticket by the orchestra area closer to the stage, they come get you and you could be the happy lady or men on stage with the artist LOL (dont wear a short dress ...)
2 singers sing and share the stage with the performers. Love the African American lady who has such an amazing voice.
The orchestra is suspended above the stage. 
The finally is interesting ah ah ah never thought of it that way LOL
Thank you for the beautiful show!"
Zumanity,"Disappointingly less impressive than expected for a Cirque show. Yes, the individual acts are of outstanding Cirque-quality but as a whole the show is tame compared to something like an Absinthe, despite the bare breasts.

If youre a Cirque fan, watch O first, then Ka, and this later.

Lastly, the $13 margarita (pre-mixed) is very weak."
Zumanity,"When compared to other shows Ive seen in Vegas, it wasnt the most amazing, but at the same time it had a completely different and unique feel to it that separates it from the rest. I really enjoyed the show, from the incredible talent to the comedic host, I would definitely recommend seeing Zumanity. My husband and I sat toward the middle of the theater about halfway up and the seats were perfect. If you purchase front row tickets, youll likely participate in the show somehow. My friends sat on couches on the balcony level and they said they really enjoyed their seats too."
Zumanity,"Reading these reviews is like taking a long twisted walk through everyones sexual hangups and projections. This show will seem tame to some and offensive to others. It all depends on your perspective. So my best advice  is to stop reading reviews, including mine, and just go see for yourself if youre curious. Ive seen Absinthe, which is similar but its humor is much more mean-spirited. Ive seen like 5 other Cirque shows. In my opinion, this is on the level with other top-notch Vegas shows.

Theres gay shit, fat bodies, drag queens, titties, body positivity and bawdy humor. Realize that not every second of the show will be catering to your preferences. If you can roll with that and enjoy the celebratory tone, you might be a good candidate to enjoy this show.

If I could offer one criticism, it would be to throw in a few more dudes. Most acts are opposite sex couples. Im not asking for full-on Thunder From Down Under, but are you familiar with Absinthes Baththub Boy act? (look it up, thank me later) Yeah... something like that."
Zumanity,"This is a fantastic and freeing show! The host is vibrant and enthusiastic, very body positive and sensually guiding through the journey of amazing skills and bodies. A sexy and enticing show with outstanding skill and warm environment! Hilarious at times and deep at others. Very inclusive show that celebrates the raw humanity of all of us. I loved it!"
Zumanity,"Exciting, hilarious &amp; just something new &amp; interesting all around! Not for the prude or close minded. We purchased front row love/couch seats &amp; it was well worth it! I would definitely go again"
Zumanity,"Ive seen better cirque de Soleil shows. This one is not one of them. Singing the rules, in which you cant hear what they say. It took the show 45 minutes to get remotely interesting. Kinda disappointed in the lack of aerials. The guy aerial was the only great thing in the show. My husband fell asleep from boredom. Save your money and find a different show."
Zumanity,"Interesting show. Erotic dance, comedy and talent was feaured. I recommend. I also recommend the balcony, there isnt a bad seat in the house."
Zumanity,"This show is hot! I took my husband to see the show for our 10 year wedding anniversary, and it was definitely an experience of a life time. The aerial acts were amazing. There were some moments where I held my breath."
Zumanity,"Prologue:
In preparation for our recent trip to Las Vegas, my girlfriend and I were considering what show wed like to see.
She had never been to a Cirque du Soleil show and she also commented about wanting to see something distinctly Las Vegas.
Zumanity seemed like the perfect choice.

The Plot:
We attended the 7:00pm show on a Monday evening and sat in the 4th row right next to the center isle.

The Scene:
This show completely met our expectations for humor, sensuality, and spectacle.
The adult themes were done humorously and tastefully without being raunchy or offensive. 
The gymnastics, singing, and music were flawless, on par with the Cirque du Soleil tradition, and were well incorporated into the shows theme.

The Rest of the Story:
Although this show may not be quite on the same spectacular production level as the other Cirque shows, it still excels as adult themed Las Vegas entertainment. 

Epilogue:
This was a great introduction to Las Vegas shows for us as a couple."
Zumanity,"This is an amazing Cirque De Soleil show that does not disappoint with its acrobatics and comedy and of course, sex! The show does not disappoint. The theater is gorgeous and there didnt appear to be a bad seat. Be aware that if you sit in the front, you may become part of the show!"
Zumanity,I enjoyed this show more than expected.  Really nice theater and great performances.  Very different than other Cirque shows.  Be prepare to see a lot of topless women :)
Zumanity,"Great performers, very provocative but the actual acts lasted barely an hour for a $100 ticket. That was disappointing."
Zumanity,"Absolutely Love this show! I saw it once a few years ago and just went to see the New changes. I would have given 5 stars but my favorite act in the show which is Alans areal silk act did not lift the woman in the air like he did in the previous show I saw. Other than that, the host was Amazing and hilarious!!!"
Zumanity,"Great show! I loved all the actors and the performances. Its a small theater so youre able to see pretty well from anywhere you sit. I loved the audience interaction. It was hilarious to watch, although I am glad I was sitting in the balcony, far enough to not get picked on. I definitely recommend for a night out with friends or date night with your partner. Try to avoid going with your parents or grandparents!"
Zumanity,"Love love love this show !!   Weve seen this show maybe 6 or 7 times in the last two years and as of right now we just got 2 tickets to go see it again!  

The venue is small as most have stated which is what makes every seat in the house a good view !

Insider tip:***   You can bring outside drinks !   Ive bought tall boys right outside in their kiosks and others straight from home and have had zeeero issues at all getting inside.   WONDERFUL!!   I save tons of money every time we come and beat the lines at concessions.  

Definitely use the myVEGAS app to get buy one get one tickets.   Its always awesome when you can get a good show at a good price !"
Zumanity,"Nope, nope, and nope. 

Having seen multiple Cirque du Soleil shows, I can confidently say that this show was by far the worst ever. 

A group of us (all girls, mid 20s) couldnt decide between a thunder from down under-esque show or a cirque du soleil show. Zumanity seemed to be a happy middle ground. Oh boy were we wrong.

Zumanity is like a group project gone wrong. Individually, each act is ok (some clearly better than others) but all together it made no sense and lacked the normal cirque du soleil pizzazz. The hosts werent funny and unnecessary. The performers lacked chemistry and everyone just seemed to be going through the motions. At some points, we were all just laughing because this show was SO BAD. Such a bummer!"
Zumanity,"My second time watching this show and boy was it just as breath taking as the first time. I remember pink Mohawk guy with the whips, red head lady playing with the ropes, the whiskey comedian, the guy and the pole and all the sensuality offered! If you leave this show dry youre doing it wrong."
Zumanity,"This was one of the best Cirque shows I have ever seen! I was a part of the audience participation portion of the show and it was a blast! The singers are amazing!! The dancing, choreography, and showmanship are something to behold. If you have to see one show, make it this one!"
Zumanity,"I received complimentary tickets for Zumanity via MyVegas rewards. I must say this has got to be the worst Cirque du Soleil show I have ever seen in Vegas. Im so glad that I did not pay a single dollar for this freak show. I would have been pissed!!

Our seats were terrible. We sat on the very first row on the balcony right in the middle. The problem with that is the railings in front of us were blocking our view to the point where I either have to slouch down on my seat to be able to see in between the railings or sit forward in my seat to see above the railings. So uncomfortable!

&amp; then there were random BRIGHT white flashes throughout the entire show. As if they didnt want us to see certain things in between the performances. SUPER ANNOYING on the eyes!

The entire show itself was weird, strange, awful, awkward, &amp; just TERRIBLE. I looked at the time &amp; thought to myself, it hasnt even been an hour yet?! After an hour I told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and he wanted to leave as well. What a waste of our time.

Please do yourself a favor and save your money &amp; time. Go watch O at Bellagio or Le Reve at Wynn instead!"
Zumanity,"HONESTLY this was by far one of my favorite shows on the strip! 
Yes it is sexy, YES itll make you feel a little aroused BUT ITS NORMAL. Listen to your body, feel comfortable about it &amp; just enjoy the show :)

They have this funny and beautiful host who talks before every new act, and she is just lovely! Cracking up jokes and having another couple interact with the crowd made it so fun to watch. 

Acts to expect:
-2 topless girls swimming in a glass bowl = super sensual and polished (MY FAVORITE)
-Bondage solo using silk fabric = this part was salacious because the lady is making some interesting noises
-Midget break dancer who goes flying all over the stage
-Cage fight between 2 men

BTW they are GENDER FRIENDLY, love is love, and they not only showcased heterosexual couples but also homosexual couples too. Its a great show to support the LGBTQ community :D

Ticket price: My boyfriend got it for us for our 2 year anniversary, 2 tickets for $154! He told me he got the deal online and we had a great view of the stage."
Zumanity,"Let me say that Im one of the few people that are not Cirque fans. This was the best Cirque show Ive been to.  The theater is one of the smaller Cirque venues but thats what makes it so good. Just about any seat is excellent. I wont give away the show and describe it but Every part of this show was great from the comedy fillers to the acrobatic acts which is very rare for a vegas show. This show was HOT, HOT HOT!!! The performers female and males were gorgeous and great at their acts.  This is a must see show if you like acrobatics and extreme sensual sexy acts. Perfect for couples but kinda creepy if you come by yourself :)"
Zumanity,"Absolutely incredible show! I have never been disappointed by any Cirque show, but I feel like this one has more to offer. Theres comedy, sensuality and the amazing acrobatics. Truly worth every dollar!"
Zumanity,"Great show with lots of laughs and sensual arousal.  Ladies in a champagne glass, honestly how can you beat that.  Tip,  get seats near as possible to the stage."
Zumanity,This wasnt what we were expecting. There were great tricks and the performers are definitely talented. It was more of a circus type show however.
Zumanity,"Ive seen a few Cirque shows in Vegas, and so far, Zumanity left me the least fulfilled. Odd, too, since it the sensual Cirque.

There are definitely some amazing acts. There are only two or three high-in-the-sky acrobatic acts, and they were definitely mind blowing. But most of the choreography, while well developed, were not as stunning. Some scenes just seemed to be about getting naked. (Ok, thats fine. But did I have to pay for that?)

The story line is also a little odd. Theres the snarky, silly part and then the more sensual, sexy parts. The hostess for the show, Eddie, is meant to tie the stories together, but I felt like I was watching two separate shows. As is occasionally true in all Cirque shows, there were some racist undertones, which is frustrating and uncomfortable.

As others have mentioned, if you dont want to be picked on, dont sit in the front row. Id add to that, though: dont sit in the first 3 rows, and in the bottom section, dont sit on the aisles. The actors and actresses definitely extended their reach beyond the first row; they even came up to the second tier of seats once to bring someone down who was sitting in an aisle.

You will get your moneys worth, but there are better Cirque shows if youre going for the visuals and awe factor."
Zumanity,"There are lots of boobs, a Facebook friend said to me, when I checked in to this show today, and he was not incorrect.

I knew what I was getting into when I booked myself a ticket Zumanity, although it did have a bit more nudity than I expected. Its all done tastefully, though, and after a while you almost start not to notice it.

To be honest, my first choice of shows was KA, but tickets were $100 or more. I was able to get a ticket for about $66 during a sale on the official site, and I was second row of the balcony which was a great seat.

Some of the acrobatics in the show really blew me away, and that is primarily why I like to see Cirque du Soleil shows, so that was great. A lot of the humor throughout the show was funny as well. The hostess was a delight and she popped up throughout the show to keep it moving along.

I would see the show again although its definitely R-rated, so its not one I would recommend for my parents or people who are more conservative."
Zumanity,"Every time Ive been to Vegas Ive seen this show. Its funny. Its racy. Lighthearted and Its very entertaining. If you dont have an open mind you will not like this show. If you have any sexual orientation, gender, race phobias stay away from this show and probably Vegas. This show has nudity, adult props, and much more than may make you highly uncomfortable around others.  Lol 
Not as many acrobats as most shows but it makes up for it through raunchy comedy and crowd interaction, thats if thats your thing. 

 They did go cheap on the souvenir cups, wasnt so happy about that."
Zumanity,"Zumanity was one of the shows I had binged watched one evening as I booked three Cirque du Soleil shows back to back on a long weekend in Las Vegas. 

Its a pretty provocative scene overall and the performers, costumes and music just work. I sat ground floor, midway back and center so the action was right in front of me. 

This is a fun show to watch and recommend it for couples. Very cool performance for sure!"
Zumanity,"I just seen the show and I had a blast. The show is very well put together and has a little of everything like comedy, sensual aerobics. I would recommend it to people that are open with there sexuality."
Zumanity,"I have seen Zumanity three times within the last year, progressively recommending and bringing with me more and new people. The latest time was this week, watching the show with my parents from Germany.

Each and every time was a blast, and the show had new elements and a few new faces every time. We loved the show this week, and sat close enough (Row A in the middle) to see the performers up close.

Knowing that this show is given twice most evenings on the week made us appreciate even more the motivated enthusiasm of the artists for their craft.

Seeing the fire and smile in the performers eyes for each act (most notably the cage-fight act and the bathtub part) made this show so much fun to watch. The care that is taken to keep quality up high through costumes and hints to full nakedness adds to my appreciation of the show.

My mum was called out on stage with Casanova and while she usually is worried about her appearance and has trouble with English, he made her feel comfortable enough to result on lots of cheers and after-show congrats by several other guests.

To me, Zumanity is a celebration of inclusion, of body types and preferences, embodiment and of love. 

I can highly recommend this show to anyone. Many people, when faced with hints to often-taboo activities will feel uncomfortable, and Zumanity allows its viewers a safe and affirmative space in which they will laugh out loud, cheer for fellow humans and become more comfortable with the most fun thing in the world."
Zumanity,"I have seen many Cirques, so I just had to see the adult themed Zumanity.  I must admit it wasnt my favorite.  Not bad, but if it was my first time seeing Cirque du Soleil, it might have been my last.

First, if you have an issue with people invading your zone of comfort, do not sit near the first 5 or so rows.  Trust me, it is extremely likely that your personal space will be invaded in a way I have never seen before.  All in fun, but up close and very personal.

Second, the show itself isnt as good as others I have seen.  I expected more.  All performers were good, but this one lacked the amazement captured by each of the other performances I have seen.

Third, there is a lot of what I would call filler or fluff.  There were times I thought to myself Just get on with the show.  The comedy was raunchy, and dare I say funny, but that just didnt make up for the lack of substance and continuity through the acts.

If you are looking for a fun, lighthearted night out with your significant other, I would recommend seeing the show.  If you have never seen a Cirque du Soleil show before, please go see another first.  I did see a group of coworkers there together...Yikes, HR on Monday, I presume."
Zumanity,"This was my first Cirque show so I dont have much to compare it to. Staff got us into our seats quickly. It was nice to see that some of the performers were mixing with the audience to keep people who got there early entertained.

Obviously its supposed to be a sexy, adults only show, but I found it relied on the nudity when it didnt even add anything to parts of the show. Ex. During the act with the bendy double-jointed, contortionist guy, there were three dancers sitting behind him just sitting and posing topless. why have the dancers on stage if they arent going to dance? Boobs. It would have been nice to see them them actually dance/perform during that part.

There was also a part when there was a couple dancing in the front part of the stage with the spotlight on them and another two dancers dancing toward the back in total darkness and maybe having them dance in the shadows is an artistic choice but it would have been nice actually be able to SEE it. The solo BDSM act with the harness was fun to watch but the pre-recorded moans makes it lose its magic a bit. Lots of acts but among my favorites was the act with two women dancing in a glass shaped pool that the raised from the floor and the aerialist on silks who flew over the audience.

The last 10 or so minutes was also just the host ribbing the audience and though the host has great comedic timing, cute jokes, etc. it felt forced, but I guess that heavily depends on the audience members that end up being chosen to participate.

Overall, it was a decent show, and the performers were all very talented. Not a lot of male eye candy for straight women, but lots of beautiful bodies to look at nonetheless. I appreciated the comedy during the show but there was more than I expected.

I liked it enough that Id spend the money on one of Cirques more premier shows, but Im not super motivated to see this one again."
Zumanity,"Ive made my bucket list of shows to watch in Vegas, and this has been on my list for quite some time. When my bf and I scored some complimentary tickets, we knew that we couldnt say no! First off, we got balcony seats and even if we were high up - dont be discouraged because you still get a wonderful view of the stage AND its helpful because you can see more of the aerial performances!

First off, my friends may call me a bit of a prude - but I would have to say that in order to enjoy the show as a whole, you need to come with an open mind. There will be sexual innuendos, partial nudity, sexual jokes, and sensual performances. However, I would say that the sensual acrobatic performances are done tastefully. There are elements of sexuality that are touched upon in the show (bondage, S&amp;M, homosexuality, heterosexuality, etc) but thats what captures the essence of Zumanity.

The performers were great. I would have to say my favorite would be the the females in the fish bowl, but all the other performances were also good. In addition, there are plenty of audience participation - so if you are shy and dont want to be chosen, just be sure to let them know ahead of time. There will be personal questions asked, but its all for the fun of the show.

I would recommend this for anyone who is open to seeing anything for shows."
Zumanity,"Get ready to step out of your comfort zone, but of course, in the best way possible! Zumanity is on the top of my highly recommended list when it comes to advising what shows on the strip to watch. So basically this isnt just one of my favorite Cirque du Soleil shows, its one of my favorite shows out of everything Ive seen on the Las Vegas strip.

Pro tip: this show isnt for the immature or very conservative folks. There is nudity involved and the show openly explores the theme of human sexuality. If youre lucky, you may even get to be a part of the show for a brief moment ;)

I can tell you why its a favorite in a few words: funny, daring, and different. Unlike other cirque shows, Zumanity is very sexy and more adult-friendly compared to the rest of the Cirque shows, but it still maintains the classic Cirque elements we all love and want to see (acrobatics, music, dancing).

I would recommend this for a fun date night... though I wouldnt recommend it if it was a first or second date. Id recommend it even if you were to see it with just friends. Its a good time. Essentially... just have fun with this show! I know you know you will."
Zumanity,"This show was AMAZING. I really didnt know what to expect. It is for an audience 18 and up and they do make sure to put that warning on every poster. I was in Las Vegas for July 4th weekend and couldnt decide which to see. After a lot of research and discussion, it was agreed that my friends and I would check out Zumanity. What made the decision easy was the fact that we were able to buy front row tickets for $65 a piece instead of the $116.00.

The show is billed as the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil for a good reason! As soon as you the show begins, we are introduced to Edie (sp) the host and mistress sensuality who basically lets us know that this show is like no other. She was 100% right. I have seen other Cirque du Soleil shows and this was completely different. It was fabulous, sexy, funny, entertaining. The set was fantastic, the music was amazing and both reminding me of a cabaret show. Please keep in mind that this show is intended for adults (naked people, breasts and gluteus maximus are exposed). 
Although it was different from the other shows by Cirque du Soleil, one theme remains and it is the excellent performance by the acrobats, dancers and contortionists. 
Also another thing that I need to point is that if you are sitting in the front row, you are likely to end up on stage.

In conclusion, you have to go with an open mind because most of the show is about sensuality and sexuality. If those themes bother you, it may not be a show for you to see. I, on the other hand enjoyed it and I thought it was very creative and entertaining."
Zumanity,"I LOVED this show. 

We sat in the first row (the couches) and it gave such a different perspective on how focused the performers are. Watching their bodies twist and turn in almost nudity was such a pure experience. 

The sexual nature of the show was funny, and I was delighted the entire time. My cheeks hurt afterwards. I am a good sport and when I was asked to stand up I gladly did so. I wont reveal too much information as I dont want to give it away, but if you want to be involved, sit in the first row! 

We had so much fun. It was so beautiful and welcoming.

I also enjoyed that at the end of the show, you are invited to take out your phones take some photos. This is a nice touch as I have been to several shows that allows zero photos at any time and they are really strict about it, allowing them at the end was a brilliant idea to capture some memories. 

I would so go and see this show again."
Zumanity,"My hubby and I were first timers this past Saturday. We finally decided it was time to see it after a few years of interest and planning. We have procrastinated since were locals but it was a must do while we were at the awesome New York New York Hotel and Casino (one of our favorite MGM Mlife property) for the Valentines Day weekend/our pre VDay date.

Zumanity: funny, naughty, boobies and a couple of jiggly covered male genitalias lol nuff said just go and watch it!

We highly recommend it for the married couples out there.

Tip:
There is a parking fee to park at the NYNY garage. But you may hop around all other MGM properties and park at their garages for no extra charge. Just hold on to your parking ticket yw!"
Zumanity,What a shame!!! I have seen this show many times and this was so disappointing. Edie the host that I saw before was my favorite. They changed now and using Axel the one that performs Ariel on the metal chains. His number is amazing but he does have what Edie had. The dance numbers with the boys have been taken out. The 3 boys on chines pole have been taken out. The boys have been removed from the dance number with the girls. The woman that does the bondage scene on straps is gone. Its now more for middle America and seems to take out all the edginess and showing alternative lifestyles gay trans etc. Thats what this show was celebrating before and now its a much water downed version. Was so disappointed even my two friends that came from Paris were disappointed and it was there first time.
Zumanity,Fun and lively show. It was sexy and comical. Maybe it was attending the show after dinner but the singing lulled me to sleep. I would see it again with floor seats for a different perspective than my balcony seats. Be prepared to have a good time. Hats off to the cast on their sensual acrobatic performances!  I will see the show again and sit as near to the stage as possible for a different experience than the balcony.
Zumanity,"Yikes!  Ive never considered myself a prude. I mean my God I remember getting excited about a performance with female ejaculation in the 80s. So why did I find myself cringing?  Wondering if the actors were on drugs? Feeling painfully pitying of the performers?  This is our first Vegas trip; our first Vegas show. Is this what Vegas is all about?  Fortunately weve now experienced other Vegas shows and the answer is no. The acrobatics were phenomenal; the singing was excellent. The banter of the MC and the other performers who interacted with the audience was stupid, tasteless and gratuitous. There was a stunning absence of class to the whole experience.  I cant say often enough I felt sorry for the performers. Maybe it was a deliberate show of misfit toys, freaks, or was it just where people not quite up to par for another Cirque du Soleil show have to settle. Clearly they were amazing athletes but in addition to that they had to get naked. Go see a different show if you want to see Cirque du Soleil. Love the Beatles was more arousing than Zumanity even though the Zumanity host kept asking are you horny yet?"
Zumanity,"The show: An honestly underwhelming show for Cirque du Soleil. I feel like they relied more on their sexual humor versus their dancing, acrobatics, and music. While there were plenty of laughs, there was a point where I started to feel like I was listening to the same joke over and over again. Dont pick this show if its your first Cirque du Soleil, and Id say skip it if youre going for any of the acrobatics usually offered at these shows. 

The venue at New York New York: I was sat up on the balcony. It was a far distance from the stage, and the ledge in front of me (sat in the first row on the balcony) was a little too high. I had to lean forward a lot to see certain parts of the show. It was cool to be up there and watch the swinging guy come up so close as he swung wildly through the air."
Zumanity,"Where do I even start? When we came to Vegas last week, there was one thing that was a must and that was to see a Cirque show. There are 7 Cirque shows in Vegas but something kept drawing us back to this one. Some would call it risqué I found it absolutely beautiful. The show celebrates all forms of sensuality and sexuality. Theres beautiful acrobatic acts throughout. The performers were all absolutely gorgeous and in sync with one another. And there was quite a bit of humor. Which I didnt expect but it was great. Its an 18+ show, there is nudity but its so tasteful throughout. Tickets are reasonable as well. They get the audience involves throughout the performance as well and cameras are prohibited throughout til the end. Its a MUST SEE, you will not be disappointed!"
Zumanity,"There is like a bunch of Cirque du Soleil attractions in Vegas, I believe pretty much every major hotel has one. This one is presented at the New York New York Hotel. As a matter of fact, I have never been to one of their shows before, so I wasnt really sure what to expect, especially considering that Zumanity apparently is their only adults only (18+) show. To be honest, I was a bit skeptic at first, considering all the hype surrounding the franchise and how overpriced are their tickets when they come to Brazil.  

Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised with how good the show was. It had just the right mix of humor and choreography. The presentation, of course, is not for the prudes, since there is constantly half naked people on the stage and a lot of sexual innuendo, but all in good taste. There is a lot of guest participation with the cast constantly interacting with the audience. If you are not into that, I would advise you to no seat on the stage level, and to choose a balcony seat instead. Since it was our first time, we did bought the cheapest balcony seats, but stage level seats would have been much nicer.

The show lasts about 90 min and there are no intermission. You are not allowed to take photos or film the presentation, which seems reasonable to me.

I would watch this show again, this time in a better seat, and I look forward on going to other Cirque du Soleil attractions in the future."
Zumanity,"Zumanity - My first cirque du Soleil performance in person. In all reality in the previews you can tell its for an adult audience and there will be nudity. I mean it isnt just called sin city just for the heck of it. 

Overall this was an outstanding show. The pre show 15 mins before the actual was priceless. Two obese sisters almost like cocktail waitresses but with strawberries are extremely interactive with the audience and hilarious. 

There were acts that ranges from sensual to bondage and ending with an orgy(no real sex) a lot is customs. Fair warning there are numerous ladies without tops all the time. Im a gay male and honestly enjoyed the show. It suits any orientation straight, bi, lesbian, gay. Overall show was entertaining, hilarious, sensational and a great experience. 

I give this a 4 stars because its not quite up to par for a 5 star cirque du Soleil show such as Dralion or la nouba (watched on dvd)."
Zumanity,"Total and complete waste of $350. I have been to other cirque shows and left in aw of how beautiful and magical they were. 

I was hoping this would be the same, but with a sexy twist. I thought wrong. It wasnt entertaining, it was extremely boring. 

Very trashy show."
Zumanity,This is a great show if youre looking for something different. If you want just acrobatics dont go here! If youre uncomfortable with anything sexual dont go here! Its an awesome show! I wish there were a little more acrobatics but it was still great!
Zumanity,"I really enjoyed the fish bowl act and the guy that was swinging from the metal chains. If you watched those two acts and walked out then this was a pretty good show. However, if you stayed for the long journey it really felt like a grind. 

First off, it was really random and did not have cohesiveness between acts nor was there that cirque pizzazz 

There were too many aerial acts that just werent up to par to the guy with the red hair. My neighbor fell asleep during the 3rd aerial act; I dont blame him. 

I thought the crowd participation acts were a little too much. Ex: raping some asian dude (he seriously was not having fun), two random people assumed cowboy position (it looked and felt very awkward for everyone including the audience) and some random act when they were having an orgy on the stage with crowd participation which doesnt have to do anything with anything. 

In closing, I think I expect too much from these cirque shows because of the big name and money/time invested into watching these types of shows. This show needs a new direction to be great. 

Thanks for reading."
Zumanity,"This show is definitely not for the faint hearted!
There are lots of nudity but I love it. There are singing, acrobats, dancing, comedy. Love love love.
If you are in vegas, go watch this show.
If you dont want to be pulled on stage, dont sit on the front! :)"
Zumanity,This has been my least-favorite cirque show. I took my boyfriend to see this performance which happened to be his first so he didnt have anything to compare it to. It wasnt nearly as acrobatic or an awe-inspiring performance as any of the other cirque shows Ive seen. This one was very funny and and filled with sexual innuendos which is its only saving grace from receiving a 1 or 2 star from me.
Zumanity,"***** Locals Discount: 2 tickets for $99 *****

This was a really fun show! Dubbed The Sensual Side of Cirque, this show seems ideal for couples to enjoy together. As many others have stated, the show  is not for the easily offended. We, however, had a great time! There was comedy, outstanding acrobatic stunts, and an abundance of (hilarious) crowd interaction!

There was so much to take in and enjoy. So, without giving away too much, here are some of the things I took away from the show...

- You will see a good amount of nudity. 
- The language and joking is a bit raunchy....but fun. lol Actually I thought Absinthe was much raunchier content wise. So, if you can handle that, this should be a cake walk
- there is a buff midget in the show that tripped me the hell out
-if seeing 2 dudes lip lock bothers you, dont go 
- you will see some barely dressed big girls
- the girls in the fishbowl were great!
- the contortionist was freaky and the crowd got kind of quiet for that lol
- also got pretty quiet when the two guys kept lip locking
- the orgy scene at the end was hilarious!

A few of the scenes seemed to drag a bit, such as the girl/recorded orgasm bit and the bondage scenes didnt do much for me either. Maybe thats all so much personal taste though.

I thought the drag queen emcee was outstanding! She kept the show going, had the crowd engaged, and kept the jokes and innuendo coming! 

This is definitely worth checking out! You wont see as many breath taking acrobatic moments than you would at, say, Ka or Mystere...but it is a fun show to enjoy with your significant other.

4 solid stars!"
Zumanity,"This isnt Cirque Du Soleil, it just isnt. My husband and I were thoroughly disappointed, especially for the money we spent. If youre looking for the iconic breathtaking Cirque Du Soleil show, look elsewhere. 

It was a cheap mix of Rocky Horror meet acrobatics with odd scenes of uncomfortable jokes in between. Some of the performances were amazing, but they felt brief and were just thrown together with odd uncomfortable sex jokes thrown in between. There was no story like or flow to the show. 

It would have been better to save $100 dollars and go see a Burlesque show. It may even bet better."
Zumanity,"Just blown away by this. What showmanship. Great music, amazing acts. Id rather not give spoilers out here. Also though the view should be good from any seats, go for upper orchestra if possible. Makes the experience extra surreal. Worth the price."
Zumanity,"I really enjoyed this show.  It was highly recommended by my husband who saw it a few years ago.  

Its the adult Cirque show and it lives up to that title.  Its pretty racy and gender-bending but I loved it. 

The MC of the show - a large lovely man with boobs had a great personality, sensual voice, and was just fabulous all around. 

They really get the audience involved who are sitting in the main lower part so if you are planning to go and dont go for that sort of thing you might want to sit higher up and away from the first 10 rows or so - choose seats after the break where there is a walkway.  

I loved the stunts of the talented performers - there were some pretty awesome things we saw - and lots of awesome bodies as well! 

It was fabulous and provided some entertainment Vegas-style with some body-bending stuff and nudity thrown in!"
Zumanity,"The most savory succulent buffet on the Vegas Strip that will entice your Sacral Chakra. From the Pre-Show appetizer, Main dishes to the lip smacking desserts.  This show is the drink to quench your thirst for that Vegas fantasy.
    If Im going to sin I might as well get it right and be in the city where its encouraged.  Do not go with family unless you have a very open family. To really enjoy this show you MUST have an open mind.  It was a parade of sexual innuendos done tastefully.
      The athleticism of these artist and performers is just amazing in that Cirque flare.  The musicians were world class with a rock edge.  Its funny, provocative, vulgar, sexy and very LGBT. So if any of that isnt in your scope of Vegas entertainment then try another Cirque show. If sexual material and profanity with lots of crowd participation is in your scope you are in for a lovely evening.  Do not miss the Pre-show!  Go early to catch it.  You will be laughing for days thinking of the Clowns.
     Hey Cirque! Can you create another show based around the Clowns? It doesnt hurt to ask and put it out into Yelp-land.  I look forward to stepping out of the Vegas glitz and into the dark erotic Vegas red velvet corridor of love to see it again.     
     To give your curious minds a tease of what is to be discovered and seen.  Nudity! Woo! lol Yes! Tits.  Lots of tits! With an equal amount of lots of ass.  Nice tits and nice ass throughout the show. Gay guys in red stilettos in a cage. Rawr! (that was my roar), two gals intertwining in a lustful ballet underwater in a giant martini glass (well thats what Im calling it)  threesomes, ropes, cracking whips, little people, voluptuous gals, soft orgy and more. Lovely evening right?!
     You will be left sexually inspired.  So dont go ripping off your bed sheets and tying it on your ceiling in attempt to do a sexy Cirque move off your chandelier to impress your date.  Just buy your date a ticket.  
     Zumanity is a Yummy mouth watering buffet of all things sex ****!"
Zumanity,"This show was AMAZING! 18+ only, which was enough of a draw for me.

The theater is small and intimate. It was a very pleasant atmosphere.

The show is basically a very sexy acrobatic show. I was super impressed with all the acts. It was your typical Cirque show--that is to say, mind blowingly amazing--with nudity and sexual innuendo.

The one thing I didnt like was all the audience interaction. Maybe this is just me personally, but after one or two acts with an audience member, Im done with that."
Zumanity,The show was entertaining but felt very rehearsed and seemed like they were just going through the motions. The end scene was not great. They were all having a pretend orgy on stage. The audience seemed like they were having fun. I probably would not go see again.
Zumanity,"I have seen many Cirque shows. This one is pretty good in my opinion. I would definitely see this with your significant other and nobody else. It is a very sexy, erotic show. Past that though, the feats performed are amazing and certainly up to par with other magnificent acts in other shows like Mystere. If you are prude or uptight at all, dont bother going to this show. If not, grab a couple drinks and kick back for some nudity and fun. We got tickets through Tix4Tonight the day of the show. We purchased the lowest priced seats available at the time, which were still great seats and then when we got there we were upgraded to the love seats in the front row! As others have said I recommend getting there a bit early to enjoy the pre-show antics. We really enjoyed the show and am so happy that we finally got the chance to see it!!"
Zumanity,"Fun show. I have never seen a cirque du Soleil show before and had always wanted to so when we decided to vacation in Vegas  I looked for one and found this. I dont have another cirque du Soleil to compare it to but Im pretty sure this is not cream of the crop. At any rate, my husband and I had a great time. Theres a lot of audience participation so be ready. If youre in the front row, expect to be in the show. We were about 3 rows back and worried the whole time about being in the spotlight or pulled onto stage. The shows pretty racy so you cant be a prude or come with someone who is. All the dancers are in great athletic shape."
Zumanity,"Go see it!!!!!! Adults only, go with an open mind and enjoy the entertainment. I LOVE how all body types are represented in this show. It made it more real for some of us. This is another show Id love seeing again. The dancers kept us engaged, it was funny watching audience members get so involved without being bashful."
Zumanity,"Im on the fence between 2 and 3 stars, but I give them credit for being a pretty unique show. 

This is an adult show - nudity, profanity, and suggestive content. I got a kick out of the ushers outfits. Hilarious. The stage is smaller and its a more intimate theater. We sat in the balcony but it still felt like we were really close to the stage. 

The end of the show was very boring for me. Like other reviewers said, they spent the remainder of the time talking to the audience. If I wanted that I would go to a stand-up comedy show."
Zumanity,"I liked it, dont get me wrong, but maybe I went with the wrong people. I went with 2 of my co-workers on the 7pm Sunday night showing. Two of us had seen other cirque shows before and one had never been to a show in Vegas.

The girls were all topless. The hostess was in drag (she was great). I mean overall everything was great and obviously very well practiced, I just didnt enjoy it as much as Mystere. 

I wish there were more acrobatics than there was dancing. Our seats were great though (we were in the 2nd tier) and we could see everything. I was told not to sit in the front because its hard to view. The only benefit of sitting in the front was they are very interactive with the crowd. I enjoyed that and had a good time laughing towards the end.

Like I said, I enjoyed it but it wasnt my favorite and I would have probably recommended Mystere over this show."
Zumanity,"I FINALLY got a chance to see this show! I got way more than I expected out of it thats for sure; I guess my expectations were a little too average or  low. Basically its a cirque du soleil show with a lot of sex in it; nudity, sexual innuendos, jokes, games , toys and play, so you wont be able to take your kids here and if youre a prude this is NOT for you. The characters represent all sexual orientations, heterosexual and LBGTQ, and its awesome! Besides all the sex stuff the show itself REALLY is good, so they didnt NEED sex but its a damn good addition! X-D Theres a lot of crowd participation so no one is left out. Also, you may be in the mood for a little hanky panky after this show is over so hopefully you have a plan in motion, dont forget to give the gift shop a visit before you go  ;-P"
Zumanity,"I cant say I didnt have reservations about this show - not knowing what to expect - and reading some very interesting reviews.  All my reservations went out the window quickly!

We were seated near the front to the right of the stage - I must say Im glad we werent too close nor on the couch seats as they were frequent targets of audience participation.  I loved it, but Im glad it wasnt me that participated :)

Edie, The Mistress of Sensuality, played excellent host as the master of ceremonies.  She was the glue that brought the acts together.  The show, and its acts, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Bordering on making me blush a few times, this was an experience I will not forget.

The highlights for me were the extreme aerial act, the closing act (orgy), and the amazing musical performance of the cellist Mariko."
Zumanity,I enjoyed this show very much. I laughed a lot. It definately was sexual but also comical. Not as much of the acrobatics as Ive seen in other shows but I wasnt upset with this show at all. The atmosphere I enjoyed a lot and the interactions with the audience were hilarious.
Zumanity,"This is everything anyone could want from Vegas! Sex, beautiful people, acrobatics, and some gambling (based on where you sit you might get pulled on stage). My love and I had a great time enjoying the show. The acts were so uniquely cirque du soleil. Each minute was sexy and fun but also breathtaking. Its definitely more burlesque like than o imagined. Also lots of titties! Be aware!"
Zumanity,"MY BOYFRIEND AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS SHOW!!!!! It was funny, sexy, beautiful, mesmerizing.... best live performance I have ever seen! Everything about this show is worth seeing - I want to go again! The host is hilarious... actors are very interactive with the audience... be prepared to be pulled on stage if youre in the first few rows!"
Zumanity,"Now I might be biased because I had such great seats.   The two lovely.. uh. Hefty maids got very up close...   Go see the show to see what I mean.
Now having said that. This is an excellent show if you are open minded.  If you are VERY  conservative I would definately skip this show.
The hostess is beautiful, funny, and has her own secrets that I will definately not tell.  
The acts are a mix of cirque show and cabaret.   There are some very funny parts. Some sexy parts, but all of it, is super fun.

Tip time - get there early to enjoy the preshow show.. trust me..."
Zumanity,"Well my wife and I went to see the show out of curiosity and to have one spicy thing to talk about at home. It had its funny parts, the nudity was handled well but I came to believe their audience members they selected were plants. Which took some of the fun out of it, but they must of had their reasons. Their were some  oh my moments but only one bothered me to the point that I would have skipped the show had I known in advance. But their was plenty of action elsewhere to watch during this scene."
Zumanity,"I came to see this show with my hubby for his b-day along with friends and it was really good. Ive seen other Cirque Du Soleil shows and this one is definitely different than what I was use to. 

Please be warned, you have to have a sense of humor if you are coming to watch this show. It is full of dirty jokes, and the only nudity you will see is the women being topless. It is a great show and I definitely recommend it, we all enjoyed it!"
Zumanity,"Such a fun show!  This was my first trip to Vegas celebrating the completion of my masters degree, which at one point wss in human sensuality for the disabled so it was right up my alley lol It was very tastefully done and very very funny.  If you cant laugh at sex, what CAN you laugh at?!"
Zumanity,"A different more sensual side of cirque de soleil. 
I would certainly recommend it to couples who are looking for something intimate and fun to watch while in Vegas. It definitely sets you in the mood haha. 

Theres plenty of action and crazy stunts that occur throughout the show too keeping you constantly engaged. Solid 4 stars"
Zumanity,"Ive seen Ka, Mystere and Zumanity.
Zumanity is definetly my favorite. It is very sensual but not in a perverted way. It is also VERY funny. The audience interaction waa definetly my favorite. If you dont want to be part of the show do not sit in the isle seats or the first 5 rows. Go in with an open mind ans you will have a blast. Its a shame you arw not allowed to video but its understandable. This way all your attention ia on the show and not the phone. Wouldnt mind attending again."
Zumanity,"I loved every second of this. A cross between cabaret, a variety show, burlesque, and the circus! Very sultry and sexy! The visuals were SO pleasing, the music was wonderful, and the cast was extremely talented! I liked how the audience was included in parts of the show! I recommend the Zumanitini as your beverage while watching! You must go! The inside of the theatre really does remind you of a sexy brothel! You MUST see this show! Just know you may feel extra excited (if you get my drift) during the performances!"
Zumanity,"There is nothing that is bad about this show, April 5, 2018 @ 9:30, the show is epic my only surprise is that they didnt charge more. It paid for itself in the first ten minutes, the acrobatics were unreal, the host was a great even with the surprising ending. I fell in love with the Hula-hoop dancer, I cant say anything else more than if you dont see this show, you are MISSING OUT on some special people/athletes..."
Zumanity,Decided to see an adult show while in Vegas and glad we did. Zumanity is a must see if you  have a open mind. I would definitely see this show again if I return to Vegas. The performers were awesome.
Zumanity,"This show was excellent, definitely the highlight of our time in Las Vegas. The first act, a pair of acro-gymnasts and contortionists did an act together in a glass tub that was unbelievable--its something I will never forget. The acts that followed were also incredible and very entertaining. It was clear to my husband and I that all of the performers in the show are happy to be there and seem to love what they do. Zumanity is truly the best of the best; go see for yourself. 

*As a side note, the show is sex-positive and LGBTQ inclusive/supportive which we also appreciated greatly. Zumanity has our San Francisco seal of approval!"
Zumanity,"Cirque never fails to disappoint!!! This was my 5th Cirque show. Each one unique and very special. 

Zumanity left me breathless! Ladies looked amazing! Men were smokin!!! Throw in a bit of humor with incredible contortion acts and you have one of the best shows on the strip!! Ill gladly see this again and again!! 

Do not waste your money if you lack a sense of humor, are a prude, or are extremely homophobic. You will see a lot of boobs and man booty. You will see same-sex kissing. Spend your money on another Cirque show. Youll be blown away nonetheless."
Zumanity,"Please be aware that this show is for the open minded and not your 70 year old grandparents! Guy on guy kissing, sexual performances and the entire show is hosted by a drag queen. lol

Overall, it was a great show. My gf was a bit offended because girls are topless for the majority of the performance. Great show and you can find excellent discounted tickets on Living Social. I got my tickets 2 for $120!"
Zumanity,"We caught this show last night while staying in Vegas. What an entertaining evening! The Emcee was hilarious and entertaining through the whole show. The cast was incredible, amazing acrobats, awesome stunts and beautifully presented by gorgeous ladies and men. There was comedy, sexy, sultry, vampy, gothy, and more. Very entertaining!"
Zumanity,"So naughty, and yet so nice.

This show was a raunchy and raucous good time. Its Cirque du Soliel meets burlesque, with a bit of crass humor and shameless nudity thrown in for good measure. Simply put, its a freak show in all the right ways. 

If youre shy, dont sit anywhere near the front because they WILL pick on you. (They can smell fear! LOL!). If youre close minded or a bit conservative about sex and sexuality, this might not be your thing. There were a few things in the show that I feel they couldve left out, but overall it was a wild and crazy good time."
Zumanity,"Terrific show!  If you are not a little prudish you will adore this show.  The actors are truly funny, the dancers are fantastic and there is something for everyone.  Watching the audience is almost as fun as the performers."
Zumanity,"this isnt a show for uptight/conservative folks.

 with that being said this was a great show, i seen it twice 2005 and 2018. the moment you step in the door you are transported to a boudoir of sexual energy. the individuals who are giving it a bad review are the uptight folks i talked about. if you have an open mind and like great acrobatic performance, this show is for you."
Zumanity,"I heard mixed reviews; its certainly for a progressive sexually positive crowd.  There was nothing too graphic.  Beautiful men and women; lots of breasts, butts, but no vag or penis.  Why?  Lol

Lots of comedy and beware where you sit;   Closer to stage or aisle seats and you could end up on stage.   It was a good evening.   Beautiful music and the cello player is phenomenal."
Zumanity,"I knew the premise behind the show but I still went in with an unexpected palette about what to see.

The preshow was entertaining but hard to hear due to some audience members around us.

When the MC came out and the acts started to roll, I was mesmerized. When the spiked hair guy came out on the bar, there were moments that I stopped breathing! OMG!!! what a phenom! I also loved the other aerial acts as well! I love the strap scene! I could have watched that longer! 

I loved he water bowl and I also wished that was more complex and involving other people. I found that amazing. The artistic element is amazing. The bathtub is beyond great as well.

The audience participation was great! There were some people around me making remarks about a few things within the show but they just dont get the beauty of what was on that stage!

I appreciated every aspect. When the MC told us it was done, I felt so let down until I looked at my watch because I thought no way it could be done! The 90 minutes flew by and it left me salivating for more with this cirque family. 

I am looking forward to seeing this piece grow more and hopefully be able to peek in to this world next time I am in Vegas!

Encore!"
Zumanity,"Loved this show! Fourth time in Vegas and this was my first Cirque show and I was very pleased. There was a mix up with my tickets, Id meant to purchase for the 9:30 show but my tickets were for the 7:00 show and I didnt realize it until 7:40pm. I panicked and headroom the box office and the girl there was extremely friendly and helpful and was able to get the 4 of us into the 9:30 show in all the exact same seats! Id purchased row D and she got us in row E. She told me to get there early for the wait up and Im glad we did! The sisters who come out in the beginning are absolutely hysterical. The whole show was the perfect mix of mesmerizing and funny, and I would definitely go see this one again. The concession prices were high, but youre allowed to bring in your own drinks too so Id recommend doing that instead of paying $21 for a mixed drink inside."
Zumanity,"This was not your average Cirque du Soleil show, seeing how it was 18+. The theme of the show was sensuality and sex, but CDS style. I enjoyed how some of the performances really fit the theme of the show while others were a little over the top and felt like it didnt belong. BUT everyone was really talented and had great acts in themselves. The part I didnt enjoy too much was how frequent the audience interaction had become, Im fine with a brief moment of silence while going from act to act, but some of the interactions seemed to really drag on."
Zumanity,"Awesome show ,very funny  Talented artists 
Worth getting good seats  and be open minded 
Be prepared to end up on stage"
Zumanity,The chairs are super uncomfortable and small. Its not worth the money u pay.  Prefer other Shows over this.
Zumanity,"The reviews are so mixed I was super hesitant about seeing this show but the price was right as it wasnt as expensive as the other Vegas Cirque du Soleil shows. 

So far Ive seen O (thumbs up), Ka (snore bore), Ovo (great), Wintuk (ughhhh) and Zumanity is the BEST Ive seen out of all of them! I loved this show from start to finish. 

This is not your usual cirque show, its more burlesque than circus. Theres a lot of audience participation so if you dont like that, do not sit in the first few rows. 

I dont want to spoil any part of the show but its funny, provocative, sensual, mesmerizing, sexy - I was engaged and entertained the whole time. I HIGHLY recommend watching the show!!!"
Zumanity,"This is a super amazing show and probably the best Ive ever seen in Vegas. I guess the only other show I saw was O. Its very interactive with the audience who are sitting near the front and extremely, extremely sensual. There are lots of boobs and butts. I didnt know there was going to be so much nudity. From an artistic point of view, the whole show is very beautiful celebrating the beauty of the human body and acrobatics. From a perverted point of view, non-stop boobs galore!

Beware if youre planning on your with kids/parents--it may get awkward quick.

This is a great show for a date--try to snag one of the love seats for 2 up front when youre buying your tickets. Then again, great show for anyone!"
Zumanity,"I am a Cirque du Soleil fan and sadly this show falls flat. Too much talking from the small person/host. The people/attendee involvement was unbearable and boring! Blah, blah blah!
I come to these shows to be entertained and mesmerized by the acts. Not to listen to nonsense from poorly acted skits.  If I want to hear about other peoples lives I will stay home and watch a soap! I dont care! Yank out the host and the couple...they talk way too much and add zero value to this show. They could not stop talking!
Too bad could have been super sexy...but I was bored almost falling asleep! Wanted more sexy acts! The best number was the one with the two girls in the glass."
Zumanity,"I. LOVED. IT!

If youre a prude, do-not-see-this-show!
ITS SO FUN =) I think it would be great for couples, bachelorette parties, and dates with my gay boyfriends!
This time around, I watched it with my boyfriend. And he loved it!

Along with the normal Cirque acrobatics, its so sexually charged and funny. 
For being my 1st Cirque show (Elvis Show Ive seen doesnt count,) I was extremely impressed and amazed.

Got these tix comped but, its a show I would def pay to see."
Zumanity,"There were a couple entertaining things right in the beginning (like the hula-hoop girl) that gave you the false sense of This show might be good but overall it was a total bore.  I expected sensual as they advertised but instead it was just in-your-face childish sex jokes and displays.  It was basically something a pubescent high school boy would get excited over.  Some things, like the woman having fake, pre-recorded orgasms, were just weird and slightly awkward- Im not kidding.  She was dropped from the ceiling, her body completely wrapped up in sashes and ribbons like a mummy, blindfolded.  There was no lead-up into it; just came out of nowhere from the ceiling.  Then began her violently convulsing to really loud, exaggerated orgasms like she was trying to break free from the sashes and that was her *ENTIRE* bit in the show.  Freaking bizarre.

Im sorry that we wasted our time and money to watch this.  It also seemed a lot shorter than the other Cirque du Soleil shows Ive gone to.  There wasnt any story to it either.  The other ones Ive seen all played out with a storyline to it; this one lacked that.  It was just lame sex stuff over and over.  Nothing sensual about it.  Would not recommend it nor watch it again, even if it were free."
Zumanity,"My wife and I really enjoyed this show. Very funny and up beat. 

The music was fantastic. The interaction with the audience was also enjoyable to watch. Very talented performers. 

The seating is set up so theres not a bad seat in the entire place."
Zumanity,"Zumanity was an absolutely amazing show and I would see it again in a heartbeat if I could afford it (well worth the money though).  Keep in mind that there is a lot of nudity in the form of tits and ass.  Some of the women are topless in only thongs and some of the men are also wearing just thongs throughout the show.  Zumanity is very sexually suggestive.  It has an adult only audience for a reason.  

The whole show is centered around sex and making the audience aroused.  There are situations where simulated sex is portrayed, not only with the performers but a few scenes involving the audience, all in good fun though.  It is very tastefully done (as far as tastefully done in a sexual manner goes) and is an absolutely amazing show.  If you are going as a couple and unless your women is a total prude, you will both enjoy it and I highly recommend it.  

If you look beyond the sexuality, the shows acrobatics, contortionists, acting, singing, costumes and performances are absolutely amazing.  

Keep in mind that there are sexually suggestive scenes where there is girl on girl, boy on boy, and multiple sexes involved in sexual situations."
Zumanity,"We were absolutely blown away by this show. While it is all about sex, its done in a rather tasteful way (most of the time). When its more lewd it is just for comical enjoyment. The jokes they make are great and the audience participation was so much fun. The dancers are all very, very talented. The little person was so insanely talented during his aerial act. The 18-year-old boy next to us had an erection the entire time, so that was the only awkward part. Haha"
Zumanity,"Fuh-king ah-maze-ing.

See it, its worth every fucking penny. It really doesnt matter what seats you get because they are all good, but if youre into acrobatics right above your head then absolutely spring for the seats near the stage. Come with an open attitude and a significant other and youre sure to head straight back to your room and make sexy times. Its that good."
Zumanity,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil experience and I absolutely LOVED it!  Very sexy and sensual, and super interactive even though I suggest sitting in the upper balcony to get the best views.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole show and was so upset when the show was over it felt like it went by so quickly.  I would highly recommend this show if you are looking to do something sexy with your partner but trashy strip clubs arent your scene."
Zumanity,"**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**
So you want to see Cirque du Soleil without all the snot-nosed, screaming kids? Zumanity is the place for you! Its R-rated so adults ONLY. Which is great because this show is completely sexual. The routines, scripts, actors, choreographies and attire (from the actors)... are all sensual.

So, that said. If you dont like sexual jokes or puns then this is NOT. I repeat NOT the place for you. I loved it but it is 100% about sex. There is NUDITY on the stage and the plot is SEXUAL. Dont say I didnt warn you. 

My absolute favourite part of the show were the MCs. Theres 3 of them and they are all hilarious and great at their job. Obviously some of their jokes are scripted but they are phenomenal at working with the crowd and throwing back jokes and comments. It was also great that they showed sex in a fun and non-judging environment. As oppose to the negativity we hear about so often.

Another awesome point about the show? Before the show starts, some of the performers walk through the theatre and talk with you and everyone else. Great way to get the audience engaged.

So... why did I only give three stars? Ive seen a couple of Cirque du Soleil shows and honestly... once youve seen one... youve pretty much seen it all. The performers arent the same but the performances are. Theres always someone bendy. Theres always someone with hoops or doing a trapeze act. etc. Dont get me wrong theyre amazing at what they do and Im not saying I could do it... but it gets boring after a while. 

If you havent seen Cirque du Soleil or if you are in the mood for an R-rated night... this is a great start to your sensual fantasies! ;)"
Zumanity,Very funny cabaret style show. Good audience engagement. Good looking actors. Excellent acrobatics. Price is a little steep I believe for an hour long show. But I do love Cirque du Soleil. Would recommend to a friend.
Zumanity,You need to understand before you go that this is an LBGTQ show... there are some acrobatics... but that is not the focus of the show.... this is not a Cirque du Soleil show... Not even close
Zumanity,"Great show uf you are open minded and not easily offended..lol its funny, adult content, and definitely outside of the box. Its a great show for couples. They have guest participation so be ready to possibly be selected to go up on stage! The cirque performances are great and daring and keeps you entertained from beginning to end!"
Zumanity,"First Vegas show and I was not disappointed.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into, I mean I had heard that it was super raunchy and sensual, but I didnt expect to see boobies. I thought it would just be strip teases, and dry grinding/humping...but NOPE, it was much more than that. 

Prior to the show starting, the show kind of already starts. We walked into the lobby and there was a gentleman sitting in the display case, and he was on the phone. I waved at him and he said Hi there, shake those titties for me. I was already walking away and it didnt register in my head what he said, until I was too far to react. 

Apparently this venue is much smaller than the usual Cirque de Soleil show venues. Therefore, our seats were fairly close to that of the stage. Im not complaining! $77 for those kind of seats!? Count me in! 

So my friends and I took our seats, and I noticed that some of the performers were out and about the floor, interacting with the guests and putting on a pre-show. It was pretty entertaining and I kept laughing because of how invasive it was. Invasive in the sense that they pop your bubble and get into it. You have to see it for yourself and experience it. I wont give any spoilers. 

All in all, the show was super amazing. It didnt hurt that all the performers were super fit and hot. Once I got past the fact that I was seeing boobies, I felt less awkward and much more comfortable to enjoy the show. 

This definitely isnt a show that you want to take your grandparents or parents to. Because it might end up being SUPER AWKWARD. This show is also rated R, therefore I believe you arent allowed to watch it if youre under the age of 18. 

Super adult content, so if youre REALLY conservative, this show isnt for you. If you can let loose a bit, then by all means check it out. 

Youre not allowed to take photos though, so thats a bit of a disappointment because I dont have any photos to post along with my review. :("
Zumanity,"This was my first time in Vegas (I know, a little late) and the first show I saw. Lets just say it set the bar pretty high for the rest of them! There were several scenes with different acts and props which made the show even more interesting because you just didnt know what to expect. It was also nice that the show was addressed to everyone no matter if youre gay or straight... or even a threesome??

I would recommend coming with people youre comfortable with sexually. So unless you want to sit there awkwardly next to your parents, I would come with friends or a significant other because it could get uncomfortable if youre a shy person. The show was pretty explicit and uses audience participation which was definitely the best part and hilarious!! I know they definitely had the time of their lives ;D"
Zumanity,"Couldnt stop smiling the entire show! This is probably the 5th or 6th Cirque show I have seen (some in Vegas and some in Dallas). First thing though is that people need to understand all the Cirque shows are different. That is why there are so many different shows. 

Couple things on this show......... it is adult themed. You must be 18 or older. Many of the girls are topless. If you are uncomfortable with sexuality being talked about or artistically expressed this isnt the show for you. If you are with your parents or random friends... this probably isnt the show for you either. I had been wanting to see this show for years but was always in Vegas with either my mom or my friends and neither of those people are who to see this show with in my opinion.

It was my boyfriends birthday and it being that and his first trip to Vegas I got second row center aisle seats. Awesome place to sit. Not only was the views for everything on stage so close but we got to interact with several of the performers which added to our experience. All the performers were amazing and so skilled. It was such a great experience. We absolutely LOVED it.

So glad I finally got to see this show and going with my boyfriend was the perfect choice of person to go with."
Zumanity,"Zumanity explores human sexuality, in all of its forms. From the romantic to the risque, with a dash of naughty humor, Zumanity is a provocative exhibition of love and sensuality brought to life by a diverse spectrum of characters, in an intimate cabaret-style setting for adults only.

Zumanity is New York New Yorks resident show. This is the sensual side of Cirque. There is nudity in the show, so you really have to come in with an open mind and sense of humor. 

The show starts off with a funny interaction with the audience. If you dont want to be a part of it, do not sit in like the first three rows from the stage. Me and my boyfriend were sitting in the first row of the mezzanine and we had a perfect eye level view. 

The theatre is pretty intimate so I think even if youre in the balcony, you can still see pretty good.

The performers were great. I think my most favorite part was the two girls performing in a large wine glass filled with water, but we enjoyed pretty much from beginning to end.

This show is perfect for lovers, honeymoon, a date, or if youre simply looking for something romantic to see."
Zumanity,"Okay!  I loved the show!  It was sexy, funny, funny...  Funny...  Just- wow!  
It had everything!  A water show with girls doing amazing acrobatics, a sexy male strip tease, a comedic couple who pulled in the crowd, amazing male acrobatics, dancers... A witty host....  What am I forgetting!?!?  I laughed the entire time!  
Didnt expect what I saw, but was so happy to have attended.  Its scandalous, it plays on sexuality it the rawest form...  In a playful way- doesnt make you feel uncomfortable at all.  Loved loved loved it!"
Zumanity,"My husband and I went to the 7 oclock show tonight with two other couples! I was a little nervous going into the show since I really didnt know what I was getting myself into but I was pleasantly surprised! The hosts were hilarious! They make you feel like you are at home and say all the things you wish you say but you dont! They involve the audience quite a bit but not where its exhausting! It was a mesmerizing show nothing like I have ever seen before! From topless girls to extremely attractive men (even though some were wearing heels, thats ok!), there was always something going on that appeals the eye, mind, and other parts ;)

Now to the reason I took a star away on the review! I think it wouldve been better to have an intermission and keep the show going! Everyone in our party of six were surprised at how quickly it ended! The show was approximately an hour and half and we were sad when it ended! We want more zumanity make it happen!

Thank you to the cast and crew for such an amazing and sensual show!"
Zumanity,"This was only a 4 for me. I thought it was a little short timewise compared to the other Cirque shows. It wasnt quite as sexy as I expected, given the marketing build up. And the host was not quite as over the top as the hosts at Absinthe.

 Still a good show and worth seeing, but between Zumanity and Absinthe, I preferred Absinthe."
Zumanity,"I absolutely love Cirque du Soleil shows but this one didnt really live up to typical Cirque du Soleil shows.

This 90-minute show is categorized as the sensual show, with a lot of nudity (tastful, not raunchy) and sexual content.  There were a lot of audience-performer interactions, which was fun to watch.  The performers were stunning (fit, sexy bodies) but they performed less acrobatic acts, so I wasnt really in awe as I normally am with other Cirque shows.  There honestly was no storyline whatsoever making it more of a variety show.

Although it was entertaining and pretty lively, I wouldnt (and didnt) pay to see this show."
Zumanity,"The best Cirque show Ive seen! 

After hearing about the show for years, I was basically expecting to see soft porn and flips. It was so much more than that! 

There are a ton on places to eat and grab a drink around the theater, which isnt a big shocker for a casino. You are allowed to bring drinks from outside into the theater, which I thought was great. If youre at the earlier show, you can probably catch drinks for happy hour prices. We did, however, purchase drinks inside, and they were pricey. $15+ for a mixed concoction with barely any liquor was disappointing.

The theater is somewhat small, which is great. We didnt have to spend a ton for a good view. 
The show has a good mixture of typical Cirque tricks, humor and sensuality. The sexual aspects of the show are well done. I didnt leave the show feeling like I needed to jump into bed. It was all very tasteful in my opinion.

I would love to see it again, and I highly recommend it!"
Zumanity,"We absolutely loved it! It was sexy, entertaining and so much fun!!! There were sultry eye catching scenes, daring ones that gave us anxiety! &amp; there were super funny times in between!! DEFINITELY worth going to see when your here in Vegas!!! We had the best time there!!! Definitely happy we chose this one!!"
Zumanity,"Wow, what a great show! I was very impressed at how much fun I had at this show and overall how much I enjoyed it. 

Its hard to describe but all I could say was Ive seen a large number of Cirque Du Soleil shows and this was one of the most exciting ones Ive seen to date. 

Its worth the money and lucky for you, it doesnt cost as much as many other shows on the Strip."
Zumanity,"Show was amazing! The only thing that stunk was we were in the last row which the balcony was above us and certain parts of the show we couldnt see because the balcony was blocking our view, other than that everything was great!"
Zumanity,"I arrived skeptical of the show.  I left completely amazed.  Be sure to grab a seat a few rows from the stage and be awed by what the human body can do.  The flexibility, strength, and skill of the troupe is amazing.  Yes, the format is a little risque but definitely not outrageous.  A sexual yet refined storyline and choreography.  Im a big fan!"
Zumanity,"After seeing the top 3 Cirque, then seeing this show, Im sort of in some kind of regret still. Im from the San Francisco bay area so maybe these jokes just seem like an every day type of thing for me, so the sexual jokes to me were just like oh ok whatever haha yeah I see that or hear those things very often back home.  The aerial acts werent bad. It was literally just the man in the chain and the silk performance. I had expected a lot more from this show, it being a Cirque brand. It had the staples of their brand- live music, live singing, and great costumes. 

Basically I felt that they couldve added more acrobatics and less comedy. Had I wanted to watch a comedy or dance show I wouldve went somewhere else. Nonetheless I could cross Zumanity off my to watch list."
Zumanity,"I am not a prude person, I am actually very open minded to all sexualities and activities. To my own surprise, I left this show without feeling sexy, but rather uncomfortable and annoyed. 

Hubby picked this adult show, paid $200 ish for orchestra seats close to the stage. We assumed this was like The Peep show in Cirque du Soleil style. Supposed to be sexy and sensual with all the amazing aerobics, but it was not! It was nothing sexy but annoying interacts with audience throughout the entire show. I was very relieved that hubby didnt get the love seats in the front rows, we were very close to the stage still. I felt bad for the people who had to go along with the embarrassing  supposed to be sexy  questions &amp; activities on the stage.... It was horrific!  Not to mention two men hosts kept doing strange naughty things to men and women... And the adult toys and men costumes were nothing sexy but very disturbing. The young girls performers were very beautiful with nice body, amazing costumes too.  

Most of the performance was not impressive. I only enjoyed the two girls amazing aerobic act in a huge glass cup, it was sensual, beautiful and sexy in a classy way! To my horror, there were just too many nearly naked guys on the stage... Yuk! I had to cover my eyes with napkins all the time when guys were performing, and the solo girl aerobic act on the ropes made me so uncomfortable, I have no intention to watch and listen imaginary sex scene with strangers sitting all around me.... The gay kissing was just too much... 

The final imaginary orgy performance with a man and a woman from audience was so bad, please... I only wanted to see sexy girls perform on the stage, NO naked guys, naked old women, men and fat women! 

I had to get up and took a break, one of the staffs asked if I was OK, I politely replied that I had to make a phone call, and went to the lounge in the front to sit for a while, I needed some time out seriously! One more look at some naked men, I would literally throw up in my beverage cup! Sorry I meant no disrespect for the hard working performers, I am just not that into mens bodies. Well....I started to drink so fast from my big alcohol beverage cup when I got back, too bad it didnt make me feel any better.. Guess this show was just not my type of show! I guess it is supposed to be interesting and exciting for a lot of people, but for me, it was too blunt, they shouldve made the seats less crowded... So I could at least not to be so close to the strangers around me... I am open to sexy and naughty bedroom times with my husband only.... I definitely dont like to watch a show about it in a theatre full of people.... 

They only sell drinks and snacks at concession stand outside the theatre, the frozen drink was too sweet and weak, the margarita on rock was strong though. Two big drinks and two jelly shots cost $54. 

If you want to see a show to give you ideas about  different sexualities and activities, or into buff muscular naked guys, you will love this show, otherwise, Stay away!!!"
Zumanity,"Maybe because Im an old fart, but I didnt find it that sexually explicit or vulgar. 
Most everything was done with humor.

The audience participation (of which I was one) was a lot of fun.
Some of the rope work was fantastic.

The gay scene was lame. It was interesting that in the finale, with all the cast slowly rotating around, it was all set up as heterosexual couples.

A Kathy Griffith show has more adult humor than this, so dont be scared off by some reviews.

A lot of the cast is naked from the waist up, more artistic than sexual. 
Dont worry, not a penis is shown. 

For me, the comedy act about half way through was not worthy of the talent present. Dragged on way to long, and simply wasnt fresh material, nor particularly well done.

Overall an entertaining show with some remarkable talent that is worth seeing.

Trying to be politically correct...the outstanding cast members were the tall blond guy and accompanying woman, and the, er, short fellow."
Zumanity,"Great show and well worth the $$.
We had balcony seats right over the stage which were excellent, we couldnt be picked on!
This show is so cool, the Sisters and Casanova who get the crowd going before the show starts are absolutely hilarious.  Yes, the show is sexy and may offend some (not sure why, as it is very tasteful) but the performers are absolutely incredible.  The guy that does all of the hanging and acrobatic work from the chains is INCREDIBLE.  He took our breath away several times as he hung suspended by a chain many feet from the stage only from the tips of his toes!  Both of the ladies singing had some pipes on them and could SING!  And you have to give some serious props to the band who are most of the time unseen in the background.  This is all live music and they rock it, from strings to sax to some serious on-time percussion!  Great show everyone, thanks for a wonderful evening."
Zumanity,"LOOOOOOOOOOOVED IT!!!! Im a big fan of Circue du Soleil shows so Ive seen nearly all that are on the strip. Zumanity definitely stands out among them all because of their obvious risque factor. Most of the women are topless and you see a lot of booty coming from both the girls and the guys, but even with all of their goodies out, not once did the show seem tasteless or unclassy at all. The performances were those youd see at any other cirque show, just much more sensual and sexual. But as long as you come with an open mind and with no intent to judge, youd be able to see the beauty in the performances just as I had. 

And might I add, the host of the show was FABULOUS lol. I wont elaborate. Youll just have to experience it for yourself. So go!"
Zumanity,"Was this show entertaining? Yes  
Is this show worth the normal ticket price that ranges from $75-100+? No

Luckily I went to the dress rehearsal so I only had to pay $35 for my ticket, so for that price the show was worth it. Otherwise I wouldnt recommend paying full price to see this. In my opinion this was more of a glorified strip show. Yes there were some pretty cool acrobatics and feats of strength, but then there were also parts where I felt like I was at a Chippendales show. If youre looking for a cirque show full of stunts and acrobatics, this is not the show for you. If youre looking for a strip show with lots of boobs and men in glittery g-strings with the occasional stunt, then check it out."
Zumanity,"My friend and I were really hoping for more nudity, but its pretty much just breasts. That being said, Ive never laughed so much at a Cirque show before - and Ive seen a lot of them. The host was great at playing off whatever the participants said, it was great banter that really sealed the deal. It is NOT like other Cirque shows - its more like burlesque Cirque and it didnt follow the traditional format. If youre looking for a traditional Cirque show - see O but if youre looking for something that will make you laugh until you hurt (and has really nice breasts to look at) Zumanity is where its at."
Zumanity,"This show is a must see, especially for couples. It was very refreshing  to see that they welcomed all couples, gay, lesbian, and straight. The show is interactive and entertaining from the preshow until the end. The theater is very intimate, all seats are good seats. Sitting up higher does have an advantage especially for all of the acrobatics. Very sexy and sensual show."
Zumanity,"This show was thoroughly entertaining throughout most of the show. There is a lot of comedy in between the acrobatic shows and it had me laughing. 

Definitely not the typical cirque show. It doesnt have as much flying acrobatics as some of the other shows but it has segments like the water bowl one which is completely different from the other cirques. 

There is a lot of topless women prancing around and doing crazy things along with buff pretty boys for the girls to enjoy. 

If you are a local you need to take advantage and check this show out.  

There is a lot of audience interaction thats really funny throughout the whole show. 

A really good show to watch on a date night."
Zumanity,What a waste of time and money!  Dont take your seats on the first floor- closer to the stage - you might be sorry for doing so.  This is rather a cheap production. I was very disappointed.
Zumanity,"Zumanity, how do I even start?

First off, it isnt a show for everyone.  I dont think I would want to see this show with my mom. The orgy scene might give her a heart attack.  The show is very sexually explicit with a lot of crude humor.  If you are into that, you will love the show.  Just be warned.

 With that out of the way, I think this is a great show.  It is a Cirque du Soleil show, so you know the production value is sky high. The sets are inviting and intriguing.  The theater is intimate and cozy.  The performers are at the top of their game.  The show is just really fun! With a drag queen as the hostess, you know you are going to have fun.

Make sure you get there early because many entertainers are out interacting with the audience.  There is a peep show you can peep into on your way to the theater.  So naughty, but fun too! You dont want to miss a minute of the experience!

The one section that I think is a little weak are the comedy sketches with the married couple.  All of the jokes seem to go too long and stop being funny.  They seem to drag a bit in my opinion.  The one scene that seems wayyyyyyy is the Scotch Baggies.  It is funny for the first minute or 2 but it just keeps going for about 10 minutes.  Editing is a powerful thing when it comes to comedy!

One thing worth mentioning is the seating options.  The cheapest seats (barstools) are not comfortable and in the balcony.  If you can afford it, go for orchestra seating because you butt and back will thank you at the end of the show."
Zumanity,"I really enjoyed this show! It is nothing like Ive ever seen before. 
Its dirty, funny, crude, sexual, and honestly a little weird. 
Men wearing heels better than I can. A cock fight, literally. A little gay, a little straight. It is not for everyone. If youre a prude, I wouldnt see this show. 
If youre open minded, you will love it!"
Zumanity,"Sooooo...if youre a prude, stay at home. This show is not for you. Do not go with your parents or children either. Its a sexy show that touches on a little of everything.  Its racy, exciting, and gender bending so if youre chill with that, go and be prepared to be amazed. These folks are talented!"
Zumanity,"Sensuality
Acrobatics
Dance
Talented Performers

Zumanity is definitely a unique entity of its own. I was told that the show would be sexual. I just didnt know how sexual until I got there. 

Prior to the start of the show, performers walk up and down the aisles and interact with you. They will even come and sit on your lap and feed you strawberries! 

The show was tastefully done and truly achieves its goal of celebrating the beauty of the human body. My favorite aspect of Zumanity is that it represents people of all sizes, shapes, and color.

{Tips} You must be 18 years old and over to see this show. Their investigation of sexuality is BOLD and could be off-putting to some."
Zumanity,"BEST Vegas show Ive seen so far!!! I LOVED this show!  Funny, sexy, entertaining, amazing acrobatics. 

What I like about this show is that they talk and interact with the audience, which is very different from all the other cirque du soleil. Ive seen Le Reve (4/5) and KA (3/5), and I enjoyed this show the best because it was so dynamic. Le Reve was beautiful, KA had a good story, Zumanity was just so funny, a lot of fun, PLUS had amazing acrobatics! Cheaper than the other ones too! My ticket was originally 90 something, paid $82 with tax and fees included through the tix4tonight booth. 

But this show is all sex, and you see lots of boobies and maybe even penis, so leave your kids at home!! And enjoy the show ;)"
Zumanity,"This is my third cirque du soleil show iv seen. Saw KA loved it , saw Totum loved it and saw Zumaity recently, unfortunately was disappointed. 

I do not recommend this circus du soleil for a first timer! There are better shows that will leave you amazed.

Zumanity was funny with a lot of audience interactions. The acts were ok but like I said not amazing. Balcony seats are ok but you end up missing some parts when the host interacts with the audience so might be worth it to get lower seats to get the full experience."
Zumanity,"A load of fun.

The Marquis de Sade would nod in approval!

Fave part of all:2 Chinese petites (or was it 3?) in the big fish bowl.

Never gets ridiculously raunchy, which I appreciated. Nabbed 2nd row seats. And YEESS, that darned spotlight did pan over us. Thank goodness didnt get picked on. Would have curled up and died.

So entertaining. Thumbs up!"
Zumanity,"The show was really the only one available on the night we wanted to see a show. Got the tickets a couple months ahead of time. The show ended up being better then I expected! Tons of stunts, good humor between scenes, and audience participation. We very much enjoyed ourselves and highly recommend this show for a good night of entertainment."
Zumanity,"This show combines dances, stunts, and sexuality together, its an erotic show, but it wont make you horny, it will only amaze you.

The performers were very talented, and the dancers gave very sexy dances. The stunts were good too, some of them were very hard to do. There was a guy who has soft bones, and he did something very shocking. The comedians and the host lady were really funny, the sexual jokes they made were super nasty, I like that.

The best part of the show was the music, the singer was amazing, and the band was perfect! The ideas of some erotic dances were good too, very sexual, especially the ones in water!

The only thing I didnt like was actually the multiple elements of the show. Its hard for me to focus on so many different types of performance, but it definitely worth the money for you to enjoy yourself!"
Zumanity,"I came here with a group of friends last night during their dress rehearsal. The show was sexy, entertaining, funny and amazing. I got the best seats right in the middle but all seats were good as the theater was not very big. It was pretty provocative including topless dancers and audience participation. The lightning, singing, choreography and acrobatic theme were creative and top notch. This show is for 18+..go with an open mind and enjoy the show."
Zumanity,Pretty neat show with some cool displays of body extorsion and acrobatics/gymnastics in general.  There was a lot more commentary and skits than I expected which was kind of a drag - not too funny and wasnt interactive for many people. At times we couldnt even see what was going on down in the audience because of poor stage placement. The pre-show was entirely filled by this type of banter and pretty dull. Definitely look online for coupons/groupons.
Zumanity,This show was great!  They tell you to arrive a half hour before the show.  I was so glad 15 minutes before the show started they had cast members engaging the audience.  The show itself was enjoyable.  Sensual - some scenarios better than others - lots of comedy interjected.  It was a little long for me but overall a great show.
Zumanity,"Thanks to winning a #LiveTheMLife Instagram contest, I got 2 tickets (really great seats!) to see this show. Based on the mixed reviews, I had low expectations going in. But this was a fabulous show! Its definitely raunchy and theres nudity. Thus, I wouldnt bring my parents here. (Note: If you are offended by drag, LGBT, boobs, sex humor, etc. this is not for you.) But my BF and I had a great time. Its both comedic and full of good Cirque performances. And the audience interaction was awesome. Its hard to say much without giving too much away. The theatre is great. Lots of red plush. Be sure to check out the performers walking around and performing in different areas as you find your seat and wait for the show to begin. Arrive early! Theres lot of pre-show happenings that you dont want to miss out on. The theatre is small-ish, so theres really not a bad seat in the place. But the closer you sit to the stage, the more likely youll become part of the show. We were thoroughly entertained! Its definitely a great show!"
Zumanity,"If you are a prude &amp; dont like sex dont come here. 

Theater was very intimate &amp; cosy.

Our balcony seats gave us a great view of all of the acrobatic acts. 

I dont like to strain my neck by looking up all the time. This would be the issue if we were in the orchestra seats.

The show over-exceeded my expectations &amp; kept me entertained the whole way through. 

Tip: if you are a student, call into box office theyll give you 20% off discount on tickets.

If you are not a student, Travelzoo also has deals going on for this show too. 

Show was great visual effect of dancing, singing, live music, sexual innuendos of sexiness."
Zumanity,"Had looked forward to seeing this show for years because I love all Cirque 
Shows and the sexy ads showed beautiful heterosexual couples. False advertising!. Disappointed that drag queen mc only interviewed and did shout-outs to gays. There was only one hetersexual couple act and it was amazing. However all other acts were predominantly homosexuals.  Topless lesbian mermaids were terrific acrobats but the homosexuality overtures were unnecessary. Bare chested gays in stillettos made even my husband squirm. Dancing was mediocre. Rather than try to be sexy, this show tried to just be shocking."
Zumanity,"This was my first cirque Soleil show and its definitely an adult type show. I would definitely recommend this show it was just so spectacular from the live orchestra to the acrobats the singers and everyone. There was a lot of intimacy performances, but I would rather keep this review as short as possible. I dont want to give anything away. Just know it was an amazing show and I wish it was longer."
Zumanity,"This is my 2nd time watching this show and it was awesome like the first time. I went with my husband, sister and her boyfriend and it was their first time watching it. They loved it!!!!!! Adam Johnson, the bartender prepped our drinks. Variety of drinks and snacks. He was so professional and made the experience even better. I would definitely recommend this show to everyone. I would watch it again and again!"
Zumanity,"The skill level isnt up with the rest of the Cirque Du Soleil shows, but its definitely entertaining.

Its definitely worth the $65 + fees

+ SEAT RECOMMENDATION +
- Make sure you get in center as you can.  There are many side seats, but the actors are mostly facing front. 
- It might be best to sit 4-8 rows back
- DO NOT sit in the very front or the isles unless you want to volunteer.  They are pretty aggressive about pulling you up.  Although the people that went up had a great time anyways so maybe you want to sit on the isles.  I would put a friend in those seats to sit back and enjoy.
- Make sure you go through discounts.  You can get best seats for half price ($65).  http://www.spoofee.com/las-vegas-show-ticket-deals/deals/865412

+ THE SHOW +
- Hosts go around interviewing random people, making them eat a banana, etc.
- Guy and Girl comes out naked doing a dance to live music/singing
- Water bowl comes out with two girls that take off their clothes.  They do crazy poses and swim in the water.  This one is a must to sit 4-8 rows back and center.
- Crazy Pink Mohawk guy swings around in the air with no safety belt.  This actually was the best part because you are just worried for him throughout the routine.  This part I think has replaced the girl in the school girl outfit with hoops.
- Beefed up James Bond gives roses to a few girls in the audience and takes off everything.  Naked girls come all around and he runs away.
- African Dance - Some girl comes out doing an intense tribe like dance
- Comedy Routine - Scotch Baggies.  Wasnt that funny, but Cirque always comes with these right.
- Animal guy, looked very intense and did a flip but that was it
- A volunteer gets picked from the audience to go up and dance
- Girl and Guy swing around in the air with blanket.
- Bath Tub Scene with 2 girls and a guy.  Guy seemed like he was just having a good time lying back.
- Contortionist - Keeps twisting his body in strange ways and gives thumbs up to let people know hes ok.
- Guy uses dancing pole to float around like 0 gravity
- S&amp;M girl on ropes.  Moaning sound coming from speakers or from her.
- Two Guys comes out in heels and dance inside a cage.
- Two volunteers get picked for comedy routine.
- Two volunteers get picked to have an orgy with the rest.
- More hilarious interviews with random audience members"
Zumanity,"Very KOOL show!! Whats funny is that a few people in our area walked out, they could not handle the sexuality therm of the show. I give it five stars and personally think it is my favorite Cirque du Soleli in Vegas."
Zumanity,"Literally SO much fun. I laughed a lot. There was only 1 scene that felt very awkward and misplaced. The rest was incredible. I have never seen cirque de soleil so Im sure this is VERY different if youre looking for a traditional show. 

The staff were organized and for people in with ease."
Zumanity,"Right from the start you are hammered with Gay, Gay, Gay, as the host(ess) is a Liza tranny and wants to make gay inuendos to all the straight men who came for the strippers.  If you are not gay dont waste your time."
Zumanity,"Zumanity is a good show worth your money. Though it is adult in its content it is no erotic. The hostess is probably a transgender and lot of the models are pretty old. 

But they know how to entertain. I would recommend not taking the balcony seats as they do not give the best possible view."
Zumanity,"Another cirque show to cross off the list!

As long as youre mentally prepared for the strong sexual suggestiveness, the crude humor, and the nudity, youll enjoy this show for what it is; entertaining, original, and an edge-of-your-seat act. Do NOT bring your parents with you; I guarantee it will end up in awkward conversations after the show or you will forget about it and never talk about it again, like it never happened. 

If youre looking for a good price, you can try Tix4Tonight (the 1/2 off show booth found on the strip). We got (what I thought) was a good deal of about $65/ticket, which included taxes. All seats in this theater are good; especially the ones farthest away from the stage, as not to be publicly humiliated in front of the audience. 

The feats performed during this show were definitely impressive. Im pretty sure my jaw was dropped during more than half of the show, or I was clinging to the edge of my seat watching the amazing display of muscular control. The audience participation made the show entertaining (if you are not involved). Some of my favorite parts of the show were the involved parties actions and reactions. 

My favorite act was the man that seemed to defy gravity; his body was parallel to the ground, while his arms were holding on to a vertical pole attached to the ground and he imitated a walking motion with his legs. Its hard to describe, but it was amazing. 

The show in general was entertaining and good, but definitely NOT family friendly. Some scenes were a bit TOO crude for my tastes (Id like to think Im pretty open-minded, but I definitely felt uncomfortable during a few parts). 

I would recommend watching this show; the choreography, singing, music, and acrobats were solid!"
Zumanity,"Fun fun and riskay show! Definitely a show you dont want to take your kids or parents to! This is a great date! Seen it a few times over the years and they change it up! Love love love all the segments of the show. Its mind blowing, funny and sexy! Boy oh boy its so pleasant on the eyes and brings out the sexual imagination to you! Definitely a must see with your significant other or a date! But maybe more like a 3rd or so date. Lol"
Zumanity,"My husband and I saw this show and Ka. This was by far our favorite show between the two. It had everything. It was funny, they interacted with the audience, amazing acts. It offered a wide variety of different Cirque Du Soleil acts. It is a sexy show, and there is jokes that are a little crude (but we thought funny). But if you are ok with that, then you will have a great time. The acts themselves I thought were all tastefully done, and some of them beautiful. There is a live orchestra and singer, which has a amazing voice. Everyone in the show is so talented. 
Tip: If you are shy, dont sit in the front row. more then likely they will talk to you or could bring you on stage. 
Overall; If you are looking to laugh, be amazed by the acts, and arent offended by nudity or sex jokes, this is the show to see!!!"
Zumanity,"Attending this show was a last minute decision and what a great decision it was!  5 stars without a doubt. 

There isnt a bad seat in the house, ticket price was perfectly reasonable, not a single act throughout the show that we didnt thoroughly enjoy (especially the lead singer, the emcee, and the Mohawk guy with magenta hair!)!  

Bottom line: absolutely fantastic!"
Zumanity,"Saw this the day after Christmas. Would not recommend you see this show or any during the holidays as I felt that we got the backup cast. After seeing lists of the acts online I know we were shorted 2-3 acts. There was a weird break in the middle of the show for scotch tape boobs which seemed out of place. I am not sure if it was a replacement act or one of the regulars.

But what everyone else said about audience participation is true. If you are on the first level in the front expect to be pulled on stage or have someone talk to you. My absolute favorite part of the show was when they pulled a little gray haired lady onto the stage to interact with Casanova. She was so overwhelmed she forgot her name. The best part was that she was there with her son.

The show tries to explore every aspect of sexuality and I think does a good job with the exception of the dudes in the cage (boring) and the beast (weird)."
Zumanity,"What a great show!  I loved it.  It was hilarious in a great way.  And it wasnt strip club sleezy.

A super fun show to watch with your S/O or with your girls.

It was very fun to watch and the host just made the show.  They were quick thinkers and funny.

I had a great time.  And I loved how some of the cast members were standing outside of the auditorium before the show started.  They really get the audience members involved which is a big plus.

I would recommend this show."
Zumanity,"Really cool. Lots of talent. I may have seen it a few years back and Im sure there is new stuff added to the shows but awesomeness. 
So I went with my mother and father. Awkward. There was one scene where the soundtrack was moaning in ecstasy. Lol awkward again. But entertaining. Go see DO NOT BRING YOUNG KIDS and it may be a bit awkward even if kids arent young. 
I actually wanna see this show again :)"
Zumanity,"My third Cirque de Soleil show!! All the shows Ive watched were so different. Ka had all the crazy acrobatics. The Beetles had alot of singing and dancing. And this one was very sensual and sexual with a lot of topless people. I know what youre all thinking.. that sounds like a.... but its not. Even though there are topless people running around, it was done with sophistication and class lol. 

I really enjoyed the show. It was very fun and lively. The person running the show was super funny. There was a variety of acts. Some acrobatic, some dances, some stand up. I love that all the music was live. They had a band and singers do all the music. They included the audience whenever they could. That was fun to watch. (one guy got called to participate with another girl from the crowd.. and his girlfriend left the show). We sat in the lower section 5-6 rows from the stage and it was perfect. It wasnt one of those big crazy stages where you need to sit at least half way back. It was a very entertaining show! 

TAKEAWAYS 
+ There is some nudity, so dont bring your kids! 
+ Very risque ;)"
Zumanity,"Amazing show! Next time we will be getting the sofa up front! 

The show is sexy, steamy, mouth watering and lip licking good! The set is fabulous and the entire experience is memorable!

If youre near the front you should expect to be pulled up on stage or have your face smothered in breasts! Yes... Lots of boobies and hips that dont stop!

Well be back! Next time the short guy is mine!!!"
Zumanity,"Its a cirque show, so def a well put together production, but compared to some of the other cirque shows in Vegas this one is not quite at the same level. We still enjoyed it and didnt leave thinking we wasted money, and the performers were as talented as youd expect, but I just cant give it a 5 when I compare it to Its sister shows."
Zumanity,"Before Zumanity, the last time I saw boobies in a handstand was at a strip club near Bayonne, NJ! Dont tell wifey.

If youre reading this, youre probably wondering if Zumanity is for you. Answer these questions to find out:

Do you like the I cant believe they said that comedy stylings of Jim Jeffries, Dave Attell, and Louis CK?

Do phallic objects, flickering tongues, and crotch thrusting amuse you?

Are enormous trannies in your Im cool with that wheelhouse?

If so, youll have a grand ol time at Zumanity! If not, dont be like the reviewer down below who was offended about tigole bitties (actually theyre small--dancers arent known for being top heavy, you know) and genital jokes.

That being said, Zumanity isnt a 5 star show. While the cast is talented, some of the acts are more comedy/audience interaction rather than backflip bonanza.

As far as sexiness goes, Im a man who knows his way around tawdry sites that end in Hub, but I gotta say, there was one act that made me a bit uncomfortable. Not sure why. Maybe it went on too long. Maybe Im more stimulated via audio versus visual. Who knows? All I know is once the act had been going on for a couple of minutes I was ready for it to end.

If you can get seats at a decent price, its worth a visit. Otherwise, I must advise you to check out Absinthe instead."
Zumanity,"Different side of Cirque du Soleil!! The naughty one, that you wont see but in Vegas!  
Sexy, sensual and entertaining. You have to be openminded to enjoy it,if you are conservative, DONT even think of going, it is not for you. Very erotic but tastefully done. P.S front raw, WATCH OUT! they will kill you ;) very hilarious!
Three and half Yelps!"
Zumanity,"Amazing show! Beautiful water routine, few acrobatics, and a bit interactive which is pretty funny. If you sit in the front four rows you have a huge Vance of getting picked to go on stage but its all in good fun and taste. I recommend for anyone !(no one under 21 in my opinion though). There is nudity, mostly women. But all in all great show!"
Zumanity,"I went here the other with somewhat high expectations. Ive heard a lot of people say that they liked the show. Now, these are people who have never seen cirque du soleil shows and people who have. I thought itd be at least a decent show. I, however did not like the show that much. Maybe because its not my cup of tea? Im not really into sensual shows or things like that. There were only 2 acts that I enjoyed, and they were the hulu-hoop girl and the girls in the water bowl. Those were the only 2 acts that had any acrobatics to the show. All of the other acts bored me, and I just wasnt interested. I believe the couple behind me actually walked out of the show. 

It was funny because I did laugh during bits and pieces of the show."
Zumanity,"Worth every penny! You have to go see this show in Vegas. OMG it was so hot and so sexy. But dont be bashful or shy about all human sexuality because they cover just about all of it from girls on girls to boys on boys to boy on girls and the like. The Hostess was super amazing. The show itself was outstanding and more than I ever expected. The ambiance was perfectly set with touches of red all over the place. Definitely a good spot to take your honey or a good girlfriend. Tickets are pricey, but you can find amazing deals if you look online. This show has repeatedly been a top bestseller on the strip. I am going back when they change it up again. They change the show around often so that its not the same show all of the time. You gotta go! Its something quite different."
Zumanity,"Hardly the best show on the strip.  I was expecting to be titilated  but was mostly bored.  The two girls in the glass was the highlight but it was at the beginning.  The show explores all forms of sexuality with every type and made fun of boring hetero 1guy, 1girl sex.  At the end there was this polite applause.  Discussion with folks around us as we left were disappointed as well. In spite of what others have said in the reviews, THERE IS NO NUDITY.  Girls are topless but zero private areas are shown which would be my definition of NUDITY, that is no clothing.

On the other end of the spectrum was Beatles Love which shouldnt be missed."
Zumanity,"So far Ive seen O, Ka, Mystere, The Beatles, and Totem. 

This one is different because of the sexy themed. More like a cabaret show with circus twist.

It was fun to watch, funny with a lot of audience interaction.

Amazing costumes, beautiful breasts and bodies.

We sat in AA row in the balcony. Its great for viewing  for a petite person because no other person sitting in front of me. The down point was the stool type seat, it has a backing but not very comfortable. 

Price: we bought our tickets from
Newyork2 concierge on the day of the show. We paid $66/person. Good deal indeed."
Zumanity,This show was so so good. It was fun and sexy and Id see it again! Its worth the extra cost to sit up front but be careful if youre shy..they pull audience members on stage. Loved it!!!
Zumanity,"Zumanity showcases the acrobatic abilities of Cirque du Soleil performers in short, comedic and sexual scenes. Its erotic, mysterious, hilarious, and thrilling to watch their beautiful feats of athleticism and balance. The MC is raunchy and sultry, and will make you laugh uproariously.  

Best views are from the center of the auditorium, not the sides. Select your seat with care, as they often select volunteers from the couple sofas and front rows. If you live in Las Vegas, check with the box office for the local deal. If you have internet, check online, as we were able to find very reasonable prices with the anniversary offer. 

Gentlemen who are looking to ogle bosoms, keep in mind that most of the performers are petite and of athletic build. They are not particularly top-heavy, but they are definitely strategically nude."
Zumanity,"Such a fun show. Theres a lot of nudity, but its done in an artistic, classy way. After a while I didnt even really notice it. There isnt as much jaw-dropping acrobatics as in other Cirque shows, but I really enjoyed the couple who did the aerial act and the ladies in the water bowl. I felt like the scene with the two guys was just for shock value, as their act wasnt really acrobatic at all. 

We had great seats in section 102, row F. We sat in the middle of the section which made us safe from being picked on by the performers. If you sit in the front few rows or in the aisle seats down the center you may get asked on stage to dance or participate in the orgy finale (!). 

The bar has jello shots!

The music and costumes are sexy, the audience participation is hilarious, and the ambiance is intimate. If you go with an open mind, and dont mind crude humor, youll have a great time."
Zumanity,"My significant other wanted me to go to a Cirque du Soleil show.  The Cirque shows at the MGM and other places were $80+ for terrible seats.  I suggested Zumanity because the tickets were a lot cheaper and the venue was a lot smaller.  The front desk at our hotel (MGM) gave us a free booklet with a list of shows and things to see in Vegas.  There was a coupon inside for Zumanity buy one ticket get another for $10.  We ended up getting tickets for the third row at the box office in New York, New York. 

We knew it was an adult show, but I didnt know what to expect besides some frontal nudity.  It is definitely not a show to take your parents to see (although I did see a mom and adult son).  There are a number of sexual and topless aspects of the show.  The MC is a drag queen and he was great and hilarious.  The show has great humor, jokes, audience interaction, and there is something for most sexual preferences and desires.  There are some gay and lesbian aspects - this may be off putting to some people - my view is what ever floats your boat.  Even if the main scene was not your thing (gay, midgets, cross dressers), there were usually people in the background doing something.  So even if the concept of a three way with one girl and two guys is not interesting to you... you can check out the topless girl dancing in the background.

There are some acrobats in the show, but the main focus is on sexual themes.  The crowd was a great mix of people: old, young, hetero, homo, foreign, and interracial couples.  Minor comment: the female performers are (mostly) in great shape so they are a little low on the cup size."
Zumanity,"The show was really great! They kept you entertained with side acts that were hillarious raunchy. Very interactive with the audience, dont sit in The first 5-7 rows of youre shy! The performers were beautiful and incredibly toned. I literally held my breath during Some of the acrobatic performances! 
The location of the theater is not so great. Its in the back corner of the New York New York casino and you had to walk through the entire restaurant district to find it. And shuffling everyone out at the end was chaos. Took at least 20 minutes to walk out."
Zumanity,"Fantastic show!!! Funny, very sexy, acrobatic and very burlesque!! For me, the best show in Las Vegas right now!!"
Zumanity,"My friend did all the ticket searching for online discounts. Be sure to find some! I recall a truck on the strip where they sell a variety of discounted tickets as well. Im not sure how much though.

Seating DOES matter if you want to be a volunteer!! If so, then sit in the front two rows or aisle seats. Otherwise, the theatre is small so doesnt matter where but try to get seats in the center though for a better view!

THE SHOW (from what I remember):
-There are two curvy sisters who come out with food trays. They entertain the audience with like oops I dropped this and bend in front of a male. Theyll even sit and jump up and down on the males. Things like that. 
-A dancing scene with 2 topless girls and 1 guy dancing. They were pretty synchronized. 
-A girl performs an African tribal dance. In the background, there is an animal guy who comes in and joins her.
-1 guy and 1 girl dance to live singing with some acrobatic performances. The entertaining parts were when he threw her into the air for some stunts. She becomes topless at the end.
-James Bond scene. The male performer does a strip tease, and he ends up running away into the night on a ladder.
-Water bowl scene with 2 topless girls. This was so mesmerizing and hot. There are men in underwear around the bowl who watch the girls. These girls were so flexible, especially the Asian girl! Did I mention it was hot?
-Bed scene where a girl lives her wet dreams. It was pretty hot. They swing around with a blanket in the air. Aerial silk.
-Red haired mohawk guy who does crazy stunts in the air. He was literally hanging in the air by his feet then by his neck. I was scared for him, twice!
-A guy who does a pole scene. He has crazy upper strength because it was FLAWLESS. It looked so easy, made me think that I can do the same. 
-This guy spins himself around with a hula hoop. It looked cool at first but was repetitive. I liked the idea of how he was mesmerized and couldnt escape the girl.
-Scotch baggies scene. Think of a ditzy girl with plastic bags stuffed in her bra. It was performed by the female swinger.
-2 volunteers get picked to imitate the swinger couple. The volunteers eventually act out a bed scene and disappear with cum shooting out.
-1 volunteer gets picked to have fun with the swinger couple on stage. They act out a scene at a club.
-A dancing scene with 6 girls and 2 guys (in heels). The guys were better than some of the girls! They do a chair dance too.
-Same 2 guys with red heels come out and tango inside a cage! I loved the tango part, wished they did more. They make out at the end.
-A scene where a girl uses ropes to act out S&amp;M. The background moans did not go with it. PRETTY AWKWARD. It was the first time I was like next..next.
-1 guy with 2 girls bathtub scene. Literally, the guy was doing the watching while the girls were touching each other. Nothing really stood out.. 
-Big orgy scene, 2 volunteers get picked to join into the circle of life. One of the volunteers was getting it! Good chuckle.

In conclusion, my friends and I liked the show. It was entertaining with the audience interaction and comedy. And of course, sexual! After all, Zumanity is known as the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil. Despite some of the cirque performances, I yearned for a few more acrobatic acts. 

I highly recommend you do NOT come with your children or family. It may be awkward. If you want other shows to check out, my friend recommended O in Bellagio or Absinthe in Caesars Palace."
Zumanity,"Im sure many people are going to be completely blown away by how sexy and sensual this show is, but in my opinion the acts were very hit or miss... mostly miss.

My date and I came to conclusion that this show is tailor-made for middle aged couples who are trying to reignite some spark they lost while theyre in Vegas by going to the sexiest (and cheapest) Cirque show in Vegas. This theory was supported by a couple of acts we witnessed. One in particular, featured about 6 muscle men trying to watch the game on an old big screen while a woman dances and writhes on top of and in front of the TV to get their attention. It was kinda of disgusting. Yes, a reality for probably a lot of people (heeeyy middle aged couples who lost their spark), but cant we move past this and elevate the show to something better than a sexist stereotype about men vs women? 

Other acts were alright but I couldnt help but laugh over the narration and weird background white noise music of orcas mating and women with a European accents whispering sssssenssssual

The comedy acts were great, probably because they werent taking themselves too seriously (and sensually) at that point. The one act I appreciated was the rope aerialist (but the overdubbed moaning was a bit much)

Overall I would recommend other Cirque shows and other variety shows over Zumanity, but if you are unfamilar with erotic movies or theater, blush when someone says arreola, and your one desire while in Vegas is to ignite that lost spark with your spouse while saving some money and seeing topless women in an artful way then.... proceed."
Zumanity,"MUST SEE! Very interactive and multifaceted show...never a dull moment. If you are easily offended then dont go! If you want to get sexed up, laugh alooooot and see amazing acrobatics then go! This is our 2nd time to see Zumanity which has changed a lot in castmates and choreography over the last 3 years. I would highly recommend the show to both out of towners and locals. Vegas folks...remember to ask for your locals discount. Lastly if you want to participate as an audience member, be sure to sit in the very front row! We will come back again...."
Zumanity,"I have been excited to see this show since about 2008. I finally got to see it, and while it was fun, it was not what I expected. It is definitely not what you typically think of when you think Cirque du Soleil. Its more of a Burlesque/Drag Show/Variety Show with some acrobatics thrown in. The best Cirque related parts of the show was the girl with the hoops and the couple dancing with the ribbons. 

The best part of the show for me, was the pre-show. It was funny and entertaining, if not embarrassing for the guests sitting front row. Zumanity while entertaining wasnt very cohesive. There seemed to be a bunch of thrown together scenes that didnt blend together as in some of the other shows.

If youre looking for somewhat bawdy entertainment Zumanity is a good choice. If youre looking for something more Cirque-ish look elsewhere. Also - its very sexual and topless so not a good choice for families. Also beware, that if you sit in the first 2 or 3 rows, they will get you! You will be made to do silly sexualized things, possibly with strangers. So if youre uncomfortable with that sit at least 4 rows back.

Hottest scene = the bath tub scene. 



Visited August 2014"
Zumanity,"Awsome, the best show Ive seen, it funny and sleazy, its an adult only show.  I dont think it matters what seat you get, every seat is a good seat.
Unless you sit close to the front where the bring strawberries out and feed the audience.
They also have audience partcipation, that is halerious.
If you get offended or dont like jokes and sexual shows this show you might not want to go see.
I want to go and see it again."
Zumanity,"This show was just as expected, risqué &amp; naughty. You will need to be very open and have a very positive sexual attitude. The MC of the show is amazing. The performers were awesome.  Do not sit in couch seats or down front unless you are ready to participate in a sexually progressive show.  In the opening my husband became part of the show by being fed strawberries and a women sitting on his lap. You will throughly enjoy the show and the amazing performers.  many  aspects of sexuality are covered and demonstrated in a sensual manner by dancing and performing.  ENJOY!!!!"
Zumanity,"HATED IT. I had so much more fun at Spearmint Rhino (strip club) than I did at Zumanity. I felt so bad for the straight guys in the audience, as Im sure they did not enjoy the show. It seemed I was the only female in the audience whoI was so excited to see Cirque du Soleil and I left feeling like I was majorly ripped off. This show does not deserve the Cirque name.

The humor was pathetic. Irritating accents and dick jokes do not make for a great show.

I have no desire to see naked morbidly obese women, men make out with each other, or titless women perform sexy routines.

The worst part was probably the woman on hone rope swing. It is not sexy to see someone flopping around to a recording of a fake orgasm. No thanks!"
Zumanity,"We loved this show and thought it was fabulous. It was erotic, humorous, and very visually entertaining. It is definitely for adults only. Try to see it with someone you love. If you are offended by sexual material, do not go to see it. I would go back and see it again for sure."
Zumanity,"Sensual and risqué routines showcasing truly talented performers. Includes dance routines and more typical Cirque moves. Had some comedy and audience participation mixed in too!  Explores the spectrum of sexuality and includes lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, orgy, drag and s&amp;m aspects.  Come with an open mind or you may be uncomfortable. I was 100% entertained."
Zumanity,"*special anniversary discount: Buy 1 get one for $10 

This one was a lot of fun and the performers get the audience involved a whole lot! If you are going to see this show you must have an open mind and not be easily offended. There is nudity, vulgar language, same-sex kissing, and sexual dialogue throughout the whole performance. And if youre someone like me who appreciates all of that, then you will very much enjoy this! 

I feel like this show really sends out a good message to the audience. I think that message is having confidence and feeling comfortable in your own sexuality! 

We are still talking laughing about it and would not mind going a second time! 

Edie the host of the show was my favorite and is absolutely fabulous!!!"
Zumanity,"Excellent show. Very well organized, professional, sexy, and hilarious. It is a combination of acrobatics, theatre, and cabaret. Perfect for dates and to go with friends. I would see it again."
Zumanity,"The comedy bits were absolutely hilarious! I was laughing out loud. The performances were extremely sexy and the acrobats were beautiful and talented. 

Definitely a Cirque show to be seen with a date. Do not see with mom and dad.

I saw it twice and it was just as funny and enjoyable the second time!"
Zumanity,"SEX! Compared to the other family friendly cirque shows, this one is not for the kiddies. Honestly, this show is created for couples, love seats, red chairs, sensual themes. Definitely, for couples! Out of the shows Ive seen in Vegas, Ka, Zarkana, and Zumanity, Zumanity is my favorite so far.

Short Reviews:
Pros: 
Great audience participation
Very engrossing acts
my type of humor, Edie the transexual hostess is hilarious

Cons:
Old stage and theater
Might be too taboo for some people 

Here is a more in-depth review with spoilers:

Water bowl- Lesbians swimming and bending in awkward shapes while naked in a water bowl. Cool. XD.

Hoops- Beastiality. Not like that, there was a guy dressed up as an animal krumping on stage!

Hand to hand- Man and woman acrobats. Very cool as the couple hold each other up in arms.

Dislocation- I dont really like contortionist.... 

Aerial straps- A woman with bondage in the air making sounds of orgasm to show masturbation and S&amp;M...  not bad... XD.

Aerial silks- Most epic aerial silk ever. Flying buff little person was quite breath taking. Depicts a relationship between a normal sized woman and a shorter man.

Aerial hoops- Didnt stand out.

Rouge Cyr- Its always crazy when people spin around on the ground with hoolahoops. 

Dance on TV-  Four women and four men dancing on stage. Pretty much a strip show.

Flamenco Dance- Epic man with his cape! I dont know how he walks around in stilletos and not break his ankles! Also, the two men fighting each other for the love of a woman was really cool inside of the stage. They resolved it with a menage a trois! ;)


Strip tease- This is for the ladies... XD.


Overall, each scene was breathtaking. Edie really made the show with his dirty double entendres.  Also, the audience participation was hilarious, I usually find audience participation to be annoying at cirque shows but it was actually really funny here. Go see this show! You wont regret it!"
Zumanity,"This is not a PG13 show, so leave the kids at home. Zumanity is different from the other Cirque shows that it has acrobatics and also a side show with the audience. Its raunchy and not for the prude. If you are not comfortable with certain sexual innuendos then this is not a show for you. I was shocked that there were some people that were not fairly warned and it was interesting to see their faces when the show started heating up. 

Its a sexy and artistic show with jokes here and there. Its not for the faint hearted and if you sit really close watch out you may become part of the show. The tickets for this show are cheap compared to other shows, and the theater is not that big. The fish bowl act was one of my faves.  This show fits perfectly in Vegas and only in Sin city would this show thrive ;-)"
Zumanity,"You have to be their 30 minutes before to enjoy the comedy scenes. The show was very well done, there is topless girls, but nothing outrages. It was done tastefully. The couple was the main hit for me. Dont want to give it away, catch the show - it will not disappoint."
Zumanity,"I read about all the shows available in Vegas before deciding on this one, because its description was so interesting. It said alternate lifestyle which piqued my interest. But the show was bit of a let down itself.
First, even though we bought the most expensive tickets in the house, our seats were trashy. We were seated on a side row, and all actors faced towards the front area 80% of the time. 
Second, there was no story to the play. It was just another regular cirque du soleil, that you can see anywhere, with partial nudity added to it. There was no lifestyle whatsoever. Without a story, it was hard to stay engaged. 
Third, there were a lot of actors on stage at various times with one main actor doing the stint. It was hard to focus on the main actor while those in background kept doing their tidbits.

In my opinion, this show is a one-time watch, but not definitely a must-watch as people say. You are not missing out on anything by missing this one."
Zumanity,"Loved it! I went to the 7:30p show on Valentines Day, and my guy and I were both super excited because 1. Zumanity sounds incredible and 2. it was my first Cirque experience. We were up in the balcony, which wasnt an issue at all. Every seat is a good seat in this beautiful theater! The performers were gorgeous and flawless - you could tell how much rehearsal goes into the show, from the music to the acrobatics to the costume design. We also loved the audience interaction, although I do wish the show was a liiiiittle bit more focused on the performers.

Overall a great show that makes you truly appreciate the human body/your significant other ;) Shoutout to the Siberian hula hooper too...daaaaaayuuum."
Zumanity,Everything I wanted out of a show in Vegas. If you are a close minded person stick with another show. At parts of the show I had tears from laughing. Deffenently recommend this show
Zumanity,"I think this is probably the best Burlesque type show youre going to see.  The acrobatics are phenomenal, its very equal opportunity and it is also very funny.  Its actually not really THAT raunchy in most of the skits, the comedy segments are far more raunchy than the stage acts which are more tasteful and choreographed.  I really like that they have people of all shapes and sizes in the show from super-plus size down to a little person who is a spectacular acrobat.  Theres a bit for all sexual orientations as well - dont go if youre offended by anything homoerotic, although the majority of the show is hetero-based there are a few very good homoerotic segments as well.  

My favorite segments from an erotic standpoint were the girls in the fishbowl and the hula hoop schoolgirl.  There were some real beefcakey men as well but for some reason Ive always found male stripping more cheesy than erotic.  That said, some of the men were fabulous athletes.  The pole dancing man made his gymnastic routine look so effortless, it was a joy to watch - same with the aforementioned little person.  

I enjoyed the audience interaction and laughed a lot.  My honey, whose idea it was to see an erotic show in Vegas where he wouldnt stick to the seat, actually preferred the comedy to the eroticism overall though he too appreciated the acrobatics.

There really isnt a bad seat in the house - actually, looking back I wish wed booked two caberet seats in the side balcony instead of regular stadium seats, as theyd have been roomier.  As with most of the shows, the seats arent particularly comfortable for larger folks.

My 5 stars is based on what it is - a humorous Burlesque show with great athletics.  Im not comparing it to other Cirque shows though the athletic talent is probably comparable.  Of course this show is only for those who are not uptight or reserved about sexuality, as it makes no secret that it is a celebration of sexuality in all its varieties."
Zumanity,"Looking for a sexy, funny and high energy charged show? Zumanity is definitely the show for you then and New York New York provides the perfect venue and atmosphere. 

In my opinion from seeing other cirque shows, the cirque performers in this show are the best of the best that they have. 

This show is extremely sexy and full of energy. My husband and I went for our anniversary and lets just say it definitely created a great mood for an overall amazing night! ;)

Although the sexiness of this show is off the scale the comedy factor is equally as good. Overall the show is fantastic especially when accompanied with your significant other. :)"
Zumanity,I would Rate this show at a million stars if I had the option this is hands down the best show on the entire strip my husband and I had an amazing time from the minute the show Began till the end we were amazed. They have not one dull moment and a beautiful story that is easy to follow I would see this again and definitely recommend this show
Zumanity,"Ehhhhh I did NOT like this show. Super disappointing for a cirque show. In your typical cirque show you have talented acrobats and amazing trapeze and ribbon work etc. In this show you get sword fighting with dildos, dry humping, and lots of t &amp; a. Yes Im serious, and Im by no means a square. I LOVED absinthe down the street at Caesars and that had naughty humor. This humor was just gross and stupid. 

Anyway. This was the strangest show Ive ever seen in Vegas. I found myself looking at the time quite often and wondering when it would be over. Wtf with the zip lock Baggie skit? Just not funny. 

There were a few good acts here and there, but overall this was just not my thing."
Zumanity,Great show. Dont sit in the first two rows unless you want to be part of the show. Most of the seats had a good view of the stage. We will be back with friends
Zumanity,From a Las Vegas local: Favorite show on the strip!
Zumanity,"I had never been to any Vegas or Cirque show so I had no idea what to expect. I have seen many small town burlesque shows though, so I knew what I was getting into in terms of materials. I had a great time! Its nothing crazy in terms of Cirque-ness, more like a very professional and artsy burlesque show. It was often funny, sometimes weird, but beautiful and fun nonetheless."
Zumanity,"It was a really good show and I was thoroughly entertained, but I was expecting something more from Cirque.  Something whimsical and exciting and extraordinary. 

There wasnt really much out of the ordinary or anything that grabbed my attention and kept me hooked.  The acts were very well paced, the jokes were good, I would totally see it again -- just not my absolute favorite thing ever.  Not to mention I feel kind of awkward watching sex things when my elbow is half an inch from rubbing up against a complete stranger.  

We actually arrived a bit late because we could not find the theatre inside the casino!  Luckily, they account for that and start the show a little bit later than scheduled while theres music and a bit of a warm-up act.... unless that was part of the show and I missed it.  Oh well."
Zumanity,"Not sure if Im Cirque du Soleild out or this show was not good, but I didnt enjoy it as much as the others.  Yes there was a lot of T and A but nothing really sensual about it.   There were some good parts and the audience participation is always funny but everything is mostly acrobatic act, contortionist, and hula hoops.  And a stupid skip about zip lock bag, booze and fake boobs.  If you saw the show you know what Im talking about."
Zumanity,A bunch of people acting like idiots on the stage.  Save your money!  Hardly like any Cirque show and the comedy wasnt funny.  Dont go!
Zumanity,"It upsets me to give Cirque du Soleil such a low review.

No really, it does. Considering Ive been to other Cirque du Soleil shows and they were spectacular.

I guess I was expecting this to be just as breath-taking.

Maybe Im jaded? Or as an Australian we see a lot more boobs than normal so realistically, the adult content of this show wasnt really adult so much as it was just another set of boobs. I mean, I love a great set of boobs as much as the next person... but the adult content was possibly not that adult when the most adult thing I heard was a recording of a woman moaning. 

Simulated dry humping and putting faces close together really isnt my idea of sexy or adult content. Sure the concepts might be adult in nature, ie. Sexualities discussed, etc but honestly? The adult content wasnt even a blip on my radar as far as adult goes...

Dont get me wrong, the guys will make you giggle and clap with their antics. But the wow factor just isnt there.

Unless you arent used to seeing boobs. If thats the case then you might get a wee bit more out of this than I did."
Zumanity,"We were supposed to see Elton Johns Million Dollar Piano ... 
but the show was cancelled.. 
and there was a mad dash for tickets for other shows

We got lucky to score seats on the balcony on the side -- best seats in my opinion since a lot of the stunts are aerial.

The stage is dated and some of the songs sound lip synced but the acrobatics
themselves were really good -- contortionist, silk, dances, etc -- very high energy.
I wish they didnt pull in the comedy skits because it takes away from the feel of this show... maybe theyre trying to get business by copying Absinthe (show at Ceasers) .. which has a totally different kind of feel not fit for this show. 

Overall, I liked it and I liked the venue it was in. 
Forewarning, if youre not comfortable with nudity and different sexual orientations then this show is NOT for you. Overheard someone saying they liked the comedy parts of the show only which I thought was a sad waste of money for them."
Zumanity,"Unless you want to have a REALLY good time tonight, I would suggest picking some balcony seats ;)

This show was super cheesy, hilarious, and sexy at the same time. Guarenteed a good time.

You better be comfortable to your sexuality though and hopefully the people youre sitting next two, b/c there were a few awkward momements... and a whole lot of nudity. 

Other than that, single, taken, married, lesbian, gay, threesome... whatever yor thing is, theyve got something for you.

One of my favorite parts of the show is the audience participation (the people closest to the stage). Luckily for our show, the audience members that participated were good sports and therefore made a hilarous, fun and entertaining segment for the rest of us!

The only thing I would have liked is maybe more acrobatics as opposose to dancing since it is a cirque du soleil show, but there was enough to satisfy me.

Overall, a good entertaining and fun show!"
Zumanity,"I saw two Cirque shows during my trip to Vegas. This was the second. The show was tasteful and the acrobatics were, as always, fantastic. As always, a few times during the show my heart dropped watching some of the stunts performed. This Cirque show was perfect for the raunchy instead of family-friendly atmosphere of most of the shows. The stunts were much more intimate than the other shows, and there was a bit for most kinks the audience could have."
Zumanity,"Yeeaaaaa..... no!

I even came into this show with low expectations. I left appalled as I didnt think it would be worse than lowered expectations.

Sure, it has a sexy theme mixed with comedy and acrobats but the execution was horrible!! The host tried to be funny but came off annoying. The acts were just random and not well thought out. There was nothing amazing or jaw dropping.

At the price we paid, it was a 1 star at best. I would price this show at $25. If you dont get it for that price, dont watch it. I honestly enjoyed the V variety show better, which was basically the same show minus all the crap.

Id have to give KA more credit after seeing zumanity. It really puts other shows into perspective when you witness the lowest setting bar."
Zumanity,"I really dont know what all the hype is about. I should have gone with my gut on this one, because I had a bad feeling about combining nudity/burlesque elements to a Cirque show. I was correct. The nudity didnt add anything to the show, and only a couple of the acrobatic acts pressed me. The entire rest of the show seemed cheesy and not NEARLY what one expects when seeing a Cirque show. There is a certain mystery and artistic beauty in most Cirque shows that was absolutely lacking here. Boring, we yawned the whole way through it. Maybe Im jaded and Ive seen too many amazing Cirque shows... but this was a major disappointment. I guess if you truly feel you are lacking opportunities to see boobs regularly you may succumb to the appeal, but Ive seen more interesting and titillating acts in my hometown amateur burlesque shows. Yawn. Should have gone to see Absinthe instead like my friend told me to."
Zumanity,"This was different than the other Cirque de Soleil  shows in a sense that its a combination of acrobatics meets stand up comedy,  all while being sexual at the same time.  I enjoyed it and was very much entertained."
Zumanity,"For this last Vegas trip this was the show component of the dinner and show that people are doing in Vegas, since the No1DP and I are both getting too old to hit the clubs :/ Although Ive been to Vegas a handful of times since my 21st birthday this was my first Cirque de Soleil show. To see one with a person who appreciate a good theatrical show was quite the experience. 

Each of the Cirque de Soleil shows focus on a specific theme; Zumanitys is the sensual side of Cirque de Soleil. This is an accurate tagline as this show is Cirque de Soleils exploration of sex in all of its forms yet maintains the class and whimsical fun of a Cirque show. In the end this is supposed to be a fun show; dont expect going into this show with the same expectations of Bellagios O (high production value), MGMs Ka (an actual story) or Mirages Love (typical musical). 

Three pieces of advice I give to you regarding the show.
1) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE try to be early, ~30 minutes before show starts Though the No1DP and I had a great dinner prior, we ended up missing the pre-show where the MC character interacted with the audience. Apparently they use this as a gauge for potential people theyll pick for the acts that involve audience interaction. We both made it RIGHT before show started and we had to stand for at least 5 minutes before ushers took us to our seats.
2) No outside food. No1DP had to rent lockers next to the New York-New York roller coaster because we wanted to take back leftover cookies (he misinterpreted my request that I sneak the cookies INSIDE my bag in a napkin to munch on during the show). Poor sweetie.
3) This is one of those shows where its best to see this with your DATE and slightly buzzed. It wouldnt feel right to see this with someone that you arent dating/seeing because its definitely going to put THOSE thoughts in you afterwards and this show with a drink in your system is a good buildup.

Since I dont want to spoil the show, I end this review with a couple of observations.
1) No1DP and I sat in one of the couches directly along the right side from the theater. We did get quite the view as we got detailed views of the actors costumes but one con was that a lot of the actor-performers were directing their attention towards the front of the stage. Its hard to watch a show if you cant see what the actors are doing unless the act involves using all parts of the stage. 
2) If you are sitting in one of the couches and would rather not be picked on, dont go to the pre-show! No1DP and I got avoided for the most part. Only time I brought forth attention was when I asked for one of the roses one of the actors was giving out as part of the act, which I got.
3) Couches were rather comfortable and spacious in that the No1DP could be sitting on one end and I could be sitting in the other end with my legs outstretched and my feet could reach the other end. 
4) Quite a number of people in fat suits. 
5) MC was good in engaging the audience and for the people who chose to participate, pushing their buttons.
6) As a lot of people have already mentioned, lots o titties. Most of them look real though I did see quite a few that were definitely not - but as part of the costume, none of that silicone crap."
Zumanity,"My sisters and I brought our parents here for their anniversary. I didnt know it was going to be THAT sexual. my dad felt really uncomfortable, but honestly if my parents werent there with us, I think Ill feel awkward still. Most of the acts were nothing to show their talents. There was less than a handful of entertaining acts. one of the act was about this girl orgasming, so while she was doing the aerial acrobat, she was moaning the entire time. SUPER AWKWARD. and there was a lot of just touching and pretty much dry sex on stage. I am not a PRUDE, but I can see that in my bedroom with no charge hahahahahah. honestly, it was almost 70$ each person &amp; I rather stay home &amp; watch tv than come back to this. sorry"
Zumanity,"I had been looking forward to this show for about 3 years! For some reason, every time Ive been to Vegas in the past 3 years (About 4 times), Zumanity was on hiatus (holiday weekends off, maybe?). Anyways, after all that hype, I was a little disappointed.

Highlight:
- Edie the drag queen host was effing hilarious and was great at improv with people in the crowd
- The Sex Therapist Couple: the woman was hilarious! Especially her Scotch baggies skit. I was laughing so hard!

Low Light:
- Racist black people dancing like animals with bongo music playing. Wtf? There were no other race-related/stereotypical dances that happened!
- If you dont sit at stage-level, you might as well not go. My husband and I sat on balcony level because we heard the cast brings people on stage and wanted to avoid that at all costs. However, we were penalized seeing only about 60% of the impromptu stuff with the crowd in the beginning and at random times during the show
- The show wasnt that sexy! It was definitely more of a scantily-clad circus than anything else

Unforgettable Moment:
- The bondage skit had everyone in the entire theater holding their breath. It was so sexually-charged! 

My recommendation:
Go see them with a comp ticket, travel deal, or with the savings they are offering with this being their 10th year anniversary"
Zumanity,"This has to be one of the best shows I have ever saw!Perfect for date night but keep in mind this show is extremely sexual so you must be open minded.My husband and I sat in the 5th row and we were able to see everything perfectly! They get the audience to engage in the show which is hilarious. If you want to see an amazing show and something that may have you step out of your comfort zone, go see Zumanity."
Zumanity,"Sexy, funny, and amazing! This show is all my wife and I have talked about since we got back from Vegas! Its 90 minutes of nonstop fun. They have a couple bars inside and I recommend buying the 32oz mixed drink so you dont have to get up mid-show to get another. I was in the front row on a love seat and was made part of the show. I got on stage and it was CRAZY with the energy from the show. After the show they gave me a free 5x7 of being on stage! I wouldnt miss this show if youre looking for a great Vegas experience."
Zumanity,"I am a 21 year old female from Arizona and found this show hilarious!! For everyone being negative saying it is raunchy trashy and tasteless you need to grow up.  Yes there is vulgar language and sexual scenes HENCE why its only for 18 and over.  I thought the actors and actresses did a great job! Yes there were boobs and butts throughout the entire show.. but I guess Im just not one to be freaked out by the human body considering we all have one.  
I must say the audience interaction made the show!! I was within a very open minded go with the flow audience which made my experience great.  I enjoyed every minute of it! If youre afraid of nipples and butt cheeks stay away, but if youre the 80% that dont mind youll have a blast!"
Zumanity,"Holy crap this show is amazing, it is perfect for those who like it a little rowdy and raunchy and just plain awesome. It was an endless sexy meat parade. If you are opposed to having fun or seeing a boob or two you should probably not see it. And promptly return to the rock from under which you came.

The theater is beautiful, the show is great, the artists were amazing, I loved every minute. Money well spent."
Zumanity,"I have seen many Cirque shows over the years so I know what to expect from them. This one was totally out of left field and is billed as the Sensual Side of Cirque du Soleil. Boy, oh boy, more like the KINKY side for sure! 

Sex!
Nudity!
Wild Dancing!
Sexy performers!
Crazy acrobatics!
Comedy!
Strap-ons!

Toto - were definitely not in Kansas anymore!

If you are a bit of a prude and cant handle watching this type of subject matter surrounded by an audience do not see it. If you prefer the standard type of Cirque show do not see it. If you cant handle large women dressed in leather and fishnets feeding you strawberries at your seat do not go see it. If you like risque adventures and have an open mind then go see it by all means.

Lots of skits all featuring sexy performers. The performers many times come into the audience to interact, and even drag a few onto the stage. If you are sitting in one of the special love seats along the stage be prepared as you might become a target for the performers. As with all their shows the music and singing is top notch.

Do not, I repeat, do not bring your parents or family members to see this. Go with your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, partner, or sex buddy. Be prepared to enjoy an adventure of the human body and all aspects of sexuality that accompanies it. 

Also, the chick performing with the hoops in the air is smoking hot!"
Zumanity,"This review is for the show only!

For the most part, hubby and I enjoyed this show.  Hubby said there were parts of the show that made him uncomfortable but I liked the whole risque-ness of the show.  Weve only ever seen Mystere from Cirque de Soleil, so we dont have much to compare and go by.  I think all the seats would have been good seats because the stage was very close to the seatings.

Warning though, this is not a show to watch with the parents...it may be a little uncomfortable."
Zumanity,"When I booked our room at Mandalay Bay, it came with a deal for two complimentary tickets to a list of shows. We decided to see Zumanity since neither my cousin or I had seen a Cirque du Soleil show and we were so so so excited!

Zumanity is located inside New York New York towards the back of the casino. The theater itself was comfortable, intimate, and all the plush, red colors gave off a very sexy vibe. We sat in the balcony (row EE) and we could see everything! Pretty good for free tickets ;)

The show itself is more on the burlesque side and not only features acrobats and dancers, but also some fun crude humor. The show is very sensual, sexy, and fun. The live band was awesome! Its definitely not for anyone who is prude or easily offended and not appropriate for kids. In fact, they advertise their show as 21+. Some of my favorite acts were the acrobats and tissue dancers! So beautiful! However, the highlight of the show was the middle-aged lady who pretty much mounted one of the dancers and made out with his body...hilarious! 

I honestly wasnt sure what to expect out of Zumanity but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! It was so much fun and definitely a highlight of our Vegas trip. Keep an open mind and dont hesitate to see this show ;)"
Zumanity,"Raunchy comedy meets Cirque du Soleil.

I was there for an early Valentines Day celebration with Allyson, and it was almost a full house.

We were sitting right behind the love seats, and I have to say our seats were phenomenal.

I dont really want to give out too much about the show for those who havent seen it.

Please go see this show. I will leave it at that."
Zumanity,"Ive never seen so many breasts in one show! Funny, entertaining, and sexually explicit. The acts are pretty impressive, but I could have done without so many breasts in your face.  Im not a prude or anything, but I felt that a lot of the acts did not need to be performed topless, the performers were just topless because of whatever sexy theme they were being forced to fulfill.

I wouldnt pay full price for the tickets, save that for La Reve or Ka.  Get the M life card and save yourself 35% off show tickets or a student ID card for 25% off for Zumanity."
Zumanity,"This is the third Cirque de Soleil that my wife and I have attended. Between O and Ka, Zumanity is by far our favorite. The acrobats were stunning, the cast was engaging and funny, and the music was awesome. The show is about sex. Perfect. What else can I say. We sat mid section beneath the balcony and the view was great. Id definitely recommend sitting in the lower level seats. Tip, buy your drinks outside the theater and bring them in a plastic cup provided by the bartender. The bars within the theater are limited and priced much higher."
Zumanity,"Definitely the show was worth it! My friends and I were just visiting Vegas on the weekend &amp; we all wanted to a watch a show. We knew there would be nudity, and this show was just amazing. We felt like we got a mix of the other shows we wanted to watch as well. Very entertaining &amp; engaging with audiences. Would love to visit again &amp; wouldnt mind watching this show again!"
Zumanity,"Have been O, KA and Zumanity, and have to say O is still #1 but Zumanity is followed. Show is funny, impressive and surprising. We laughed a lot and dont feel it is sexually attracted to the performers. The show caught our eyes and ears at very beginning and all the way to the end."
Zumanity,This show was A-OK but a huge step below the other shows we have seen like Ka and O.  The theater is gorgeous and the music was wonderful but the acts were just a step behind their other other shows.  We enjoyed seeing lots of boobs g-strings but it was pretty tame stuff.  Im sure the conservative mid-westerners were blushing but I was looking for a hotter show based on the reviews.
Zumanity,"Got a phenomenal package deal through Travelzoo so I think for the price we scored, this was a decent show. At full price though? Dont expect intense circus acts that Cirque is typically known for. I felt like this was more of an artistic interpretation than a true exhibition of physical feats.

Its a sexy show and Im glad I had the opportunity to see it but my expectations were that of high-flying topless acts and thats not exactly what this is. I think this is a great primer for getting into the Las Vegas state of mind!"
Zumanity,"My wife and I went to the show excited!  We left the show disappointed.

We were excited because we have always enjoyed the all the Cirque du Soleil shows we have watched in the past.  

We were disappointed because it was nothing like the other Cirque du Soleil shows weve seen in the past.

Way too sexy and weird for our tastes.

You should decide for yourself, though.  From watching people as they exited the show, it seemed like the majority really enjoyed Zumanity.  There were many happy people that evening.

Just glad that we did not pay for the tickets.  Would have felt completely ripped off otherwise."
Zumanity,"10 years ago, when I first saw the show, it seemed risqué and delightfully naughty.  Times have changed, and public attitudes have expanded and become more tolerant (less easily shocked).  Despite this, Zumanity has remained largely unchanged.  If anything, certain scenes have actually been tamed  (Waterbowl and 2 Men).

Some of the acts have been part of the show for 10+ years, which speaks to the strength and talent of the performers.  However, the production staff of Cirque needs to update the plot and dialogue (yes, this Cirque show actually has some English narration).

The beauty of Zumanity use to be its ability to be on the edge of public mores, but without becoming vulgar or obscene.  

Cirque:  Return some Naughtiness to the show."
Zumanity,"Zumaity is located inside New York! New York! in its own auditorium done up all velvety to look like an old burlesque. This was my third Cirque Du Soleil show, and I went into it not really knowing what to expect, and from the time you walk into the auditorium, still had no clue what I was in for. 

The acrobatics where nice, sure they where not as stunning as some of the other Cirque shows, but that was made up just in the sheer enjoyability of the show. What Zumanity lacks in technicality, and dont let the term lack dissuade you as it is still spectacular, it makes up in intimacy and entertainment. From the moment you walk in they have entertainers talking to the audience. I didnt go into Zumanity thinking id be giving a full figured buxom woman a massage as she fed me a strawberry, but hey, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas...unless you decide to put it on yelp.

When the acrobats are not performing, the show revolves around audience interaction. If you do not want to be interacted with, DO NOT SIT IN THE FRONT ROW!  You may want to avoid the aisles as well. 

The music is all written for the show and performed live, and I enjoyed it as well.

Zumanity does have adult themes, but this is Las Vegas. In my opinion it has all been tasteful executed and it is a great show. I would recommend it to couples. The only catch being you have to go into it with an open mind!"
Zumanity,"Zumanity is a cabaret show by Cirque du soleil , the acrobatics were good, there is not a real storyline , this is not KA, this is not the best cirque du soleil show . If your intention is see a sexy , gross cabaret show all in one you should book your ticket for Zumanity. I went with a friend to see it , keep on mind there is nudity , my friend got sick when he saw a naked actor playing with his cock on the viewers mouth. The show is different than a typical cabaret show , the good thing is the stage was very small, whatever you book your ticket you will be very close to the stage. 
See Zumanity , only if you are open to see nudity and you are a real adult."
Zumanity,"I absolutely love the show and have seen it three times.  It will be on my itinerary next time I am in Vegas.

It is athletic, sensual, fun.  If you are uptight sexually or a right wing Conservative, I would suggest you go see Donny and Marie instead!!!

If you go see the show, do your best to get a loveseat up front so you can be an interactive participant.  Loads of laughter!!!"
Zumanity,"I hated it. 

I get that this particular Cirque de Soleil is for adults but most of the time some of the nudity made no sense to me. Its like boobs were exposed just because that seems like an adult content thing to do. It was just very, very odd and I didnt understand it.

I will say that the two ladies doing tricks in the huge martini glass was pretty cool. Thats about it."
Zumanity,"I was in the second row on the left side of the stage. I got to smack a fanny, that was fun.

The show was stunning, the people were beautiful, the nudity was tasteful, VERY funny, and a lot of audience participation.

Only reason this isnt 5 stars is because there wasnt enough Cirque du Soleil in this aptly named show.

I would go see another Cirque du Soleil show and Id even recommend this one for others with the proviso that this is a cool show but not a lot of acrobatics."
Zumanity,"Loved every minute of this very burlesque &amp; sexually charged show! They catered to everyone of every taste, Audience participation is fun and funny. Had a great time with my husband and would definitely go again!"
Zumanity,Its a really good show. Fun. Sexy. Its just not my favorite las Vegas cirque. Go with someone you want to see an adult show with. The talent is awesome.
Zumanity,"Ill have to compare the hour and a half show to getting a root canal at the dentist. Actually, I would prefer the root canal and then getting kicked in the face with a golf shoe than seeing this show again. 

Nothing more to say than what others already have. Read some of the poor reviews from other yelpers, theyre pretty spot on. 

Save your money and time. I still have nightmares of the visuals I took in that night."
Zumanity,"Saw Zumanity last week. Was underwhelmed as my expectation bar of a Cirque de Solei-branded show was set pretty high. As one of the other commenters said, this was more of a cheesey burlesque revue than an dazzling acrobatic performance. 

When we bought our tickets (from Ticketmaster), I was only given seats on the side of the stage that were best available and cost the same as the seats n the front. 

TIP: DONT BUY SEATS ON THE SIDE - THE SET IS STAGED FOR FRONT VIEWING ONLY."
Zumanity,"Had booked this show several months in advance before our Vegas trip, and so was so happy that we did! I have seen Cirque du Soleil before, but this show offered the more sensual/sexual side of Cirque. As you entered in the lobby, there are several performers in lingerie laying and playing around which was interesting. The theater is the perfect size for this show, and seats seemed to offer a good view no matter where you sat. The show was great. There was a lot of humor, audience participation made it so funny! I dont think anything can prepare the poor people who get selected to go up! All of the acts were very sensual, sexy, beautiful and awe -inspiring. One of the first acts is a giant fish bowl where two topless women are swimming around and flirting with each other, thought this was so cool. In between different acts they had actors, a couple go on stage and lighten the mood by performing comedic skits which were hilarious. I was not at all bothered, but surprised at how much nudity this show entailed. Many of the performers were topless and had their booties showing. I did not find the show to be raunchy in any way, but actually quite artistic, entertaining and inspiring. I feel like the wow factor here was the sexuality and nudity. While I was impressed and appreciate the hard work of the acrobatics, this show was not of the same caliber of other Cirque shows in terms of acrobatics. The show explored different acts of sexuality such as gay/lesbian, bondage, orgies/threesomes, intimacy, etc. Did not find it to be as awkward watching it as it sounds after reading that. They turned all of these concepts into an artistic performance or comedic act. The host of the show was amazing and I just found everything to be awesome. Tasteful, captivating, humorous, and different..definitely different. My best friend and I had a great girls night out in Vegas at this show! I was mouth agape or laughing the entire time, so good! Go with an open mind, but really was not anything overly erotic. I DID find myself surprised several times though and wondering the same thing that David After Dentist wonders after the dentist, Is this real life!?

The bar upstairs has strong drinks with cute little sexual names. I found myself ordering the Blue Balls which was a slushee drink and really good. I was drunk after finishing it because it was huge and kept me happy during the performance. However, I was very annoyed at how slowly our bartender moved (Oh no, here comes my inner NY!) Seven people in line took 20 minutes to get served. I understand the bartender was wonderful, helpful, and friendly. But as the show is starting and people are anxious to get back to their seats with a drink, what are you doing starting a conversation and making jokes? Pour the freakin drink, take the money, and yell NEXT. 

Overall, simply amazing. I feel like the regular Cirque shows can be seen anywhere, at any time. This version, Zumanity, is so unique, different, and eye opening. We are still talking about it!"
Zumanity,"THIS SHOW IS SO CRUDE!

But I love it! OhmyGod I can still remember most of the amazing acts. Shoot I cant even remember an act from KA! Thats how good Zumanity was!

TIPS SO PAY ATTENTION

-While I do think some of the audience members they pull up are actors, I dont think all of them are. So if you are seated in the front, make sure to look cute because chances are you might be pulled up onto that stage.

-Also we were seated in orchestra but the theater is so intimate that I really think seats farther back or even balcony seats have a good view.

-This show can make you a little uncomfortable. I really felt like I had to cross my legs sometimes lol! And I definitely noticed a couple of guys around me shifting themselves around.

-This show shuts people up! Not a peep out of the drunk group of guys next to me that were annoying me before the show started.

-THE SEATS ARE TINY! If you have a fat ass like I do, your booty will touch the booty next to you. Youve been warned.

-Please dont go with your parents to this show. Its awkward enough as it is already.

Also heyy to the poofy latina twins. Nice to see some thick girls on that stage! Also the hostess Miss. Edee was fabulous and her observations were so funny and on point!

I was either laughing or staring in shock. No in betweens and I loved every minute of it! This show is full of surprises and I would definitely watch it again in a heartbeat."
Zumanity,"Definitely a fun show with interesting tricks, and of course, the girls that were completely topless. The only downside was that some of the adult jokes in this show were a little over the top...

There were also moments when multiple activities can be occurring all at the same time, therefore focus your eyes on something that you like ;)

Have fun at the show!"
Zumanity,"The BEST Cirque show ever!!!!!!!!!

Have seen this show four times. For me its a must see each time i go to Vegas. Ka comes in a close second but for production value. Zumanity is an unapologetic attempt to turn you on. Its fun, funny, sexy and all so gorgeous. Over the four shows i have seen, I noticed they make subtle changes to the act. 
The men and women are incredibly gorgeous and the choreography, lighting design and the acts themselves leave you breathless. 
There is a lot more for the men to see (breasts galore) the male performers cover the bare essentials but do put on a great show. 
The singers are amazing and the song Roses which is so hard to find is my favorite. 
Pictures of the show are completely illegal and amount to stealing from the hardworking artists. People putting them up should be shot for it. 

Seating wise, I prefer stall seating front of the stage. avoid sofa seats."
Zumanity,I wouldnt even give this a one star they label this saying its a couples show but unless your lesbian or wanna see your man watch lesbian sex with two woman in a pool and 14 naked girls do not watch this. You will feel left out the three guys they did have one was a midget 4 he was a good acrobat the other guy had chains and whips and looked crazy physcopathic character who only came on stage twice and the last guy acted feminine. The entire time its just girls and one guy and stupid threesomes at the end. This show was beyond disappointing. It really upset me how the host bashed woman. Rather than telling girls to love their bodies and small boobs she did a funny demo on how to create big boobs which was pathetic really. Save your money this isnt worth it it truly is not. Attend a show thats equal. Where you and your partner can both enjoy not one where girls are flashing their tittys asses making out in pools and moaning and your left there awkward only to enjoy the midget flying the entire two hours.
Zumanity,"My husband took me to this show when we visited Vegas earlier this year. Such a funny show that was overall really good! I was expecting it to be very provocative and promiscuous, but at times that wasnt JUST the case. It was also laugh out loud hilarious.  

We also scored some good deals online, thus making the prices not expensive. This is one of the less expensive - Cirques we have seen. If youre rather conservative, this might not be your cup of tea. However, if youre ok with a little bit of humor and sensual ness you will like it. Watch it!"
Zumanity,"This show is so much fun; the perfect combination of sex and stunts. People who complain about there not being enough big stunts can go to Ka- this show isnt about stunts and ooohs and awwws. Its about making people laugh at adult themes while listening to a live band and seeing a few cool performances. If you dont like this show, you wont like Micheal Jackson either.

I loved this show and the tasteful way they make you look at the human body and what it can do. Its amazing to see, and the performers actually bring people on stage in a giant bed! My friends girlfriend was picked to go up, and I nearly peed my pants laughing. 

This isnt a show for people who cant handle looking at a semi nude human, nor for those who had ADD and get bored if fire isnt going off somewhere. This is more for people who appreciate art and a good laugh."
Zumanity,"Qualification - this review is more for Cirque in general than Zumanity in particular.  Though I did see this show and I gladly give it five stars.  But its five stars for a fixed theater show, which for me is way different than the rating system for performances in tents.

When I was small and my parents inclined Id be treated to Ringling Brothers at the Garden.  If recollection serves, we went more than a few times.  It was a seed cast on fertile soil.

Ringling was in town during my last month as an undergrad.  The carnies were the only characters who could give me a run for my money at the pool table in the bar near the arena.  I went to this show twice, and after, as I was in the throes of finals and ennui, I returned to the back door of the venue to see what it might be like to really leave with them on their train.  I met a clown out of make up.  He was less entranced by my aspiration than I.  He gave me the straight scary skinny and I moped away, dejected, wishing I had gone to clown school instead of geology school.

When the train pulled out of town I stood by the tracks and waved.  It was late.  I was sad.

Years have come and gone, but my love for the circus arts is stronger than its ever been.  You see, Im a bit of a romantic, a dreamer, trapped in a pragmatic day to day.  I believe in courting and romantic love, I believe in happy endings, I like magic.  I am also all too well aware of the rest of it, the darker underbelly of our existential explanation and how we dance so willingly to this selfish flute.

A circus well done captures all of this.  Good vanquishing evil, moons for the misbegotten, unrequited love made whole just before the curtain falls.  Its like crack for the heart.

Ive seen maybe 10 of the cirque shows, most in the Pac Bell parking lot, but a few on The Strip.  This year I think Id like to travel to see Quidam, the only tent show Ive missed.  Theyll be at the Cow Palace, but Im not a cow and it isnt a palace so I think maybe Ill go somewhere else.  Browsing the website I did find the fixed show in Macao strangely appealing.  Its a fixed show, yes.  But its in Macao.

If you said yes, Id make the reservations right now."
Zumanity,"A sexually charged show that makes you feel proud of who you are regardless of size, shape, orientation or desire. First cirque de soleil show ever, &amp; although I felt little rosebuds bloom on my cheeks from some of the jokes or the funny acts they encourage front row sweaters to partake in, I loved it! I noticed some people say it was highly sexual &amp; it put them off-um, excuse me, read the description! It states that there will be nudity, etc. everyone did a fabulous job &amp; really stayed in character! I was amazed!"
Zumanity,"Hanging out in Vegas we decided to go see Zumanity again just to check out how much it had changed. I attended and was totally surprised at the huge changes the show has made.   We attended the original Zumanity opening week with Joey Arias. We had tickets for the love seats. We were in the front three rows for the second time around. The show has gone from sensual, sexy, naughty, and fabulous to trailer trash (literally two of the main characters are crass, badly dressed, loud, and crude), unsophisticated, and so very disappointing."
Zumanity,"Zumanity was awesome!! (remember this is a sexual oriented show and there are topless women) Ive seen Mystere which had more acrobatics through out the show and Zumanity definitely had less. But Zumanity made up for that with their comedy, kept you on your toes and I was entertained the whole time! This is a must see in Vegas."
Zumanity,"Wow! I randomly went to this show in April 2013, I was skeptical because I didnt know what to expect...but I absolutely LOVED this show!!! Its entertaining on so many levels. Funny - Sexy - with amazing talent! Im headed back to Vegas soon and just bought tickets again to experience this show with my girlfriend, I only hope its as amazing as before! Go! Great Vegas experience!"
Zumanity,"As other reviewers have noted, if you are easily offended, then Zumanity is not the show for you.  However, if you want to revel in the lavish and naughty dream world that is Las Vegas, you will love it.  

Although it is a Cirque du Soleil show, it does not include jaw dropping stunts like O or Ka.   It does feature some of the best dancing I have ever seen.  Also, there are no creepy Cirque clowns. Instead, the two comedians/dancers that appear on stage in between acts kept the audience laughing with some very raunchy material.  

Best of all, there are lots of great deals on ticket prices(2 for $99 for balcony seats at with seats on the couches topping out at around $150.)  Bold souls who dare to sit in the sofa seats have a good chance at becoming part of the show."
Zumanity,"There are a few things that I aspire to complete before I die. 

1. Visit the Pyramids of Egypt.
2. Get a graduate degree.
3. Use the word merkin in a Yelp review.

Looks like I can cross #3 off my list thanks to last nights viewing of Zumanity. Not too many merkins here, but the ones that they did use did prevent any full frontal. 

This is a show best enjoyed by understanding and appreciating the human form and what those human bodies can do (and what humans do with certain human body parts). If you dont want to look at naked women, hear sex sounds, or be embarrassed by potentially going onstage for audience participation (more on that later), I dont recommend this show.

I can personally speak to the fact that they do not have plants in the audience for their audience participation. Yes, yours truly was selected to go onstage and perform with a man from Houston. The adrenaline rush was such that I barely remember it, but my friend and guest to the show Vanessa N. said that I didnt seem nervous at all. 

The show definitely pushes the envelope to transgressive but I wouldnt call it groundbreaking. Well maybe I would, considering it has a pretty wide market, potentially opening minds that wouldnt otherwise respect or appreciate outside-the-norm sexuality. 

To recap: dont go with your parents, on a first date, or expecting to see a nice little show about people falling in love. This show is about the thing that got us all here, s-e-x, and does a good job of translating it to the Cirque du Soleil stage."
Zumanity,"It was an interesting show... I think i should have seen it before Absinthe, i had higher hopes. I expected more acrobatics, almost none. There were some parts that were very funny and some acts that were filler and could be replaced by something else.

Save your money, see something else."
Zumanity,"Yeah, show made for female or couples. If your in a group of guys.........Yeah,dont do it. I give props to the performers, but as a show for everyone. The target group is females or couples. If your a guy and have it girl, yeah it worth waiting it out."
Zumanity,"My parents had seen Zumanity several years before this and were very offended, which is exactly why we chose it.  I can totally understand why they were offended.  It was a very adult show, which we both really enjoyed.  

DO NOT go to this show if you are easily offended or in any way made uncomfortable by things of a graphically sexual nature.  There are so many other Cirque shows to go to.  Dont spend $100 on this ticket if you think it might be too much.  

On the other hand, if you like raunchy humor and the amazing acrobatics Cirque is famous for this is for you.  

Most of the women spend the whole show in lingerie- thongs and bras.  Often they end of completely topless.  The men generally dress like the typical Chippendales dancer would.  

My favorite part of the show was a midget that did aerial acrobatics on two curtains.  Amazing regardless but really amazing considering that he was 4 feet tall.  My wife loved the two women that did water acrobatics in a glass that was only 3 feet deep.  I couldnt believe when they would dive into it even though it was only 3 feet deep.

It was still a Cirque du Solei show and still had its really weird parts. Very funny was this guy with a HUGE cape (25 feet diameter) that would run across the stage between acts.  Silly. 

They did have a lot of interactive points.  At one point they pulled a middle aged woman (teacher) from the audience and put her into sexual positions with one of the actors.  I imagine she was horrible embarrassed!

If you love all things raunchy and sexual, see this show.  If not, see Mystere."
Zumanity,"While this isnt my favorite Cirque show, it is still absolutely amazing! A group of my friends and I went to this show last time we were in Vegas. It is full of stunning acrobatic tricks and other staple circus spectacles.  It has a much more romantic setting than some of the other shows in Vegas. 

There were definitely more boobs and sexual scenes than I expected to see. It didnt bother me a bit, but a couple of the friends we had with us found it a bit too much. I know you are probably thinking what did you expect, which I totally agree now. But at the time, we had asked the ticket sales person if it was explicit and he acted like it was totally clean without any nudity. 

Prudeness aside, it was a great show and I definitely recommend it for the open minded people out there. If you get annoyed with nudity.....dont go to this show."
Zumanity,"Absolutely incredible! All the seats are very intimate, glad I didnt sit on the front row to be picked on though! 
Very sexy and mesmerising. Wish I had been with my boyfriend and not my female friend to watch it! Highly recommend."
Zumanity,We have seen every Cirque show in Vegas. Glad this wasnt the first one I ever saw or I probably wouldnt go to any others. It had its funny moments alright and what little acrobatic things they did they did good. But the rest of the show was just filled with freak show antics. I also think most the people they pulled from the audience where plants. The end finally was beyond weird. If your going to see a Cirque show for the first time I suggest you try one other then this one. We received one free ticket otherwise would have been even more disappointed. Oh and the $25 drinks didnt even have enough alcohol in them to make me like the show.
Zumanity,"Not my type of show...

Its a sex theme with no clear direction or storyline.

Funny at times, acrobatics were not the greatest.
I guess i was expecting something more over-the-top for the price we paid.

You can bring in outside drinks, as long as its not glass.

This theatre is small, so go ahead and buy the cheap seats.

Mystere is better than Zumanity."
Zumanity,"Let me just say I havent laughed so hard in quite awhile after seeing this show!

Ive seen alot of Cirque du Soleil shows and most of them are boring to say the least, sure they do great acts but ussaly appealing to my parents age group. Im 21 and I thought Zumaniy was HILARIOUS !!!! Its not for everyone thats for sure, I read so many bad reviews about this show and I can only think that there humor is not mine. 

Best show on the strip. thats all I can say. Dont take your kids thats for sure!"
Zumanity,"Meh. I love Cirque, in fact Id count myself as a super fan (having seen every show that I can get to in LA, Vegas, NYC or SF). I first saw Zumanity back in 2004-ish. It was sexy, fun, entertaining and sure adult, just enough, perfect. So I took my husband for his birthday (dinner and a show in Vegas, nice ;-). We both left disappointed and with raging headaches. Where was the Cirque in this show? I saw drag, boobs, lewd jokes and minor acro feats. What I missed was the charm, the sensuality and awe that most Cirque shows offer in spades. You can see the aforementioned sexy XXX anywhere in Vegas. My advice to the consumer- decide what you want if its raunch go elsewhere, if its Cirque try O. To the Cirque team- try harder to stay on brand and revert back to the show as it was 10 years ago or take your name off this show. Zumanity is not worth the time or money, sorry."
Zumanity,"I am quite amazed that this show has so many reviews, and four stars. I almost feel peer pressure to review it more favorably, but I will remain true to my feelings. I hated this show! I found no redeeming qualities about it whatsoever. What was I expecting? A hot, sexy, steamy show. That is, after all, how it is advertised. What did I get? A silly, poor attempt at comedy. Maybe I wasnt drunk enough. Look, I realize I am in the minority here...If you take one thing away from this review, just know that the sexiness portrayed by the ads is nowhere to be found. If youre in the mood for silly, youll be ok."
Zumanity,"After getting discounted tickets we watched this show. My husband and I thought it was quirky, entertaining and had lots of eye candy. I would not pay full price because the seats we sat in were not impressive.  Fun show, amazingly talented performers and it is located in a great hotel."
Zumanity,"Absolutely fantastic!! It definitely takes you to the height of sexuality &amp; requires an open mind. From nudity, to same sex kissing to sex toys (not used on people). The aerobics were amazing &amp; the cast was quite talented and VERY sexy! The madam of the hour was hilarious and definitely kept us entertained. I highly recommend it!!"
Zumanity,"*blush*
Zumanity will get you comfortable, REAL comfortable with the human body. 

We got last minute tickets for Zumanity on a Sunday night. Checking the Cirque website online, we found a 30% off student deal (Shhh...we still keep our student IDs). Score! Got seating about 7th row back from the center of the stage. I dont think it matters where you sit, unless maybe you are on the balcony, because the stage is circular and you can see the performance pretty well from all directions.

This show has a lot of interactive components. Actors will go into the audience, ask questions, talk, jiggle their boobs, etc. =P
There is a live band playing, stage singing, comedy and of course lots of acrobatics. The show was really entertaining and well acted. It is different from a lot of the Cirque shows Ive seen, in the sense that this is more focused on comedy and sexuality, versus the really technical feats of acrobatics youd see in KA and O. There are tons of R rated stuff going on, so be advised not to sit next to your parents while watching this! 

It was a very interesting show, and if you are looking for an acrobatic show with a twist, this is definitely it!"
Zumanity,"Definitely an amazing show and different side to Cirque! Dont bring your mom, your boss, or anyone else who you arent comfortable having a sexual sense of humor with!

As everyone else mentioned, there are NOT as many aerobics and gravity defying stunts as all other Cirque shows. There are some, but the stage is smaller since the show is mainly dancing with a cabaret feel so you wont see enormous props like you do in other shows. They still do amazing stunts that will make your stomach flip though!

Definitely, DEFINITELY dont come if youre conservative about sex. The female performers are mostly always topless, men in thongs, lots of sex jokes, and you have to be okay with homosexuality as some performances are man on man and woman on woman. 

The stage isnt too big so if youre in the front row, you have a huge chance of getting pulled up on stage or at least having the performers come ask you funny stuff about sex. You definitely need a good sense of humor to play along with them. If youre terrified of getting pulled onstage, avoid the first 2 rows lol. 

Its an amazing show, its not just naked weird people, theyre true artists and performers. This is definitely the Sin City side of Vegas so if you love Cirque but dont like sex and masturbation jokes, stick to their other shows. If you want all types of sex jokes with some amazing dancing and performances, this show is for you!"
Zumanity,"Ive been to many Vegas shows at this point (Blue Man Group, O, Penn &amp; Teller, etc.) and Zumanity definitely ranks up there with the best of them.  However, I will say, it really didnt hold a candle to its sister Cirque show O....O was amazing, Zumanity was very good.

I was surprised at the smallness of the theater that it plays in, but I guess I was expecting something more the size of the Vegas shows Ive been too. The theater was very nice, and because of its size, the show had a very intimate quality about it. Many of the actors walked down and around and interacted with the audience. 

A word of caution: This is a VERY sexualized show unlike other Cirque shows. You MUST be 18 to even enter the theater, and I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND GOING WITH YOUR PARENTS or anyone else that you would be even mildly uncomfortable with.  Its not just that its topless at times, because honestly, that is done very artsy and tastefully, but the show itself is centralized around  really erotic ideas. Were talking guys in underwear making out, guys in drag walking around with huge silver penises, anything you can think of. They bring members of the audience on stage and have the actors hump them. 

I could see how many people would be made very uncomfortable by the show if they were not expecting something so sexual. It didnt make me uncomfortable, but there were a lot of people who I could tell WERE. 

There were some really funny parts of the show, as well as some really beautiful parts, but all in all...their mantra is Lets Talk About Sex, Baby and talk about it they did!

I would recommend O or Blue Man Group OVER this show as I enjoyed both of those better, but I definitely do not regret going to see it."
Zumanity,"My husband surprised me with tickets while we were celebrating my birthday in Vegas over the summer.  He got them at a discount through summer of Cirque but I would definitely pay full price to see it again!

We had great seats!  We were in the 2nd row, behind the couches, center left.  Honestly, there didnt seem to be a bad seat in the house.  I was so happy that we got there a little early because the pre-show was hilarious. 

We were on the edge of our seats the entire show.  It was VERY sensual but there was also a great mix of humor, live music, and acrobatics.  I highly recommend seeing this show with your significant other!"
Zumanity,"My love suprised me by taking me here for our (night after) Valentines night together.  I had wanted to see this for so long and super excited to see it.  I have to say with all the hype there was alot to be desired.  The slapstick comedy was great and entertaining but as far as everything else it was a stretch.  Weird and awkward at times.  I guess Ive seen alot of Cirque shows and it was really just another Cirque show.

Please dont get me wrong there was alot of talent here. The little guy doing the acrobatic part was one of our favorite parts.  The 2 guy tease back and forth you could have taken out...pretty tacky-and who really does that no matter who you are?  Like in other posts the audience interaction was funny but a little too much of that.

We ran into some friends while we were there and their thought of the show was just as ours was EH.  It was weird and entertaining to say the least.  Good to at least say Ive seen it."
Zumanity,"Wow, this was actually the second best Cirque show I have ever seen and I think I have seen all of them!  This show had good humor, interesting dancing and unusual sets.  The nudity was minimal and the show didnt drag on like most shows."
Zumanity,"I have been to several burlesque and cabaret performances over the years, and this one is by far the best! The show is fantastic, a great mix of erotic and sensual acts with just enough comedy thrown in to help break the tension. I went with a friend for a girls trip, and now I cant wait to come back with my husband. There are so many great acts, we had a hard time picking our favorites. I loved the two women in the fishbowl,  the man flying around on the chain,  and the two men dancing in the cage. There was also a good amount of audience participation, so if you want to be a part of that, spring for the good tickets. Overall, there is something to meet everyones desires and kinks. Five stars!"
Zumanity,Great show. Seats are a little tight so be prepared if you are a little hippy like me.  We sat in section 102 maybe 6 rows back.. PREFECT! The stage is high so if you sat too close you were looking UP at the stage. Audience interaction was funny. Arrive early so you can enjoy the entire show.  A lot of different personalities for every audience member. Not my first Cirque show. It was good but still not my favorite.
Zumanity,"Got tickets from the discounted stand under Golden Nugget(?? forgot)
Advertised as: sensual more like..kinky! its a great show, not for the faint hearted or mature asian folks over 50s. (whom I saw a three generaation asian family with horrified WTF look on their face, and trying to figure out if they truly walked into the wrong show - LOL)

Content warning: same-gender kissing, female masturbating, naked ballet dancers; etc. Youll love it if you consider the above mentioned as a form of art. I do feel bad for that large &amp; elder Asian family - who seriously looked like they have no idea what they got themselves into. 

Not recommended for: adults over a certain elders range. Conservative individuals. Asian mothers."
Zumanity,"This was so much fun. 

NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR CONSERVATIVE ASIAN MAMA.

Im glad I didnt. This was so Rihanna-Rated-R, and SO MUCH FUN. I love their openness. I can see how a lot of narrow-minded people would not enjoy this because it certainly skirts the boundaries of sexy to lewd. 

There was definitely not one crude moment and my absolute favorite was the host, who I think is a man dressed as a woman.

The main focus of this show was definitely 1) sensuality, then 2) humor then 3) acrobatics. Theres not as much emphasis on contortion, gymnastics, etc as much as other Cirque du Soleil shows so if youre looking for that, then I suggest trying out the other shows."
Zumanity,"Cirques Zumanity is a mix of fantastic feats, sensual suggestions and bawdy humor, with the actors interacting with the audience throughput the performance. A drag queen acts as MC and connects the acts which vary from acrobatic, aerial, dance and vaudeville. Some of the outstanding acts to me were, two lithe and supple young women swimming/dancing in an over-sized martini glass that was just beautifully orchestrated, a bathtub dance between an unbelievably buff couple and the aerial hoola-hoop act, and plenty of just beautiful bodies! The only thing I thought was a little weird was the auto-erotic aerial act, breaking the karma from sensual to slightly lewd.

In-between, there is a vaudeville type couple that does very funny skits and pulls up unsuspecting patrons to do hilarious things.  ==SPOILER ALERT== Beware middle-aged ladies-- a roaming gigolo looks for victims for the orgy scene and one of them was me! Antonio kept coming by me, feeling my knee and putting my hands on his well-beefed abs which I gladly acquiesced. I see it was a rouse to determine how much I could take before he pulled me up on stage and humped me all in good fun. The audience was really supportive as I walked out with my beet red face, telling me the whole thing was hysterical and making me laugh. Great show!"
Zumanity,"Actually... meh

Ive seen other Cirque shows, and this one is more filler less jaw dropping wow. 

Maybe Im desensitized....  Maybe the bar has been set too high by the other Cirque experiences.... 

If you want mediocre humor, mild raunch, and non mind blowing acrobatics this is for you. My lady enjoyed it, so I give it 3 stars. Make this your first Cirque show, and make sure to not pay full price, you will love it much more than I did."
Zumanity,"Fun and flirty, this Cirque show has evolved quite a bit over the years.  I got a package deal from New York, New York, that included two tickets, a fifty dollar dinner credit, two drinks from the Cirque Lounge,and a souvenir program.  The program is an art work in itself, and commmemorates this funny frolic.   Great seats in the front balcony.
The acrobatic dance is sensual and mysterious and the champagne glass bath is classic.  Raunchy jokes and visual puns keep up the humor, and the show delivers that certain Cirque allure."
Zumanity,"It was a great show and I was entertained, but it is really more on the funny side than the awe-inspiring side of Cirque du Soleil.  We had seen Zarkana earlier in the week and loved it so much we decided to try to see another Cirque show.  This one didnt quite meet our expectations as far as aerial stunts and wow factor goes but it was a good show.  There is a little something for everyone regardless of your sexual orientation.  Guys get to look at a lot of naked boobs and booties, and ladies you get a sexy man or two thrown in too.  The MC is entertaining and skits are funny.  I laughed out loud through most of the show.   Definitely not for children, or anyone not comfortable talking about sex.  It is a sensual show.  Not up for some embarrassing, sexually oriented, audience participation?  Not the show for you then.  

Cons:  A little crude at points, no real death defying aerial stunts
Pros:  Very entertaining, sensual in nature"
Zumanity,"I must have seen Zumanity at least three times now. Nothing beats a live performance. This Cirque show has brought me the most laughs! Thank you Zumanity, you never disappoint!"
Zumanity,"The host was so FAAABULOUS!
Loved the water number and the African dance number.
Maybe its because I didnt have the highest expectation in regards to acrobatic moves, i really enjoyed the show! Its comedic at times and can make you feel a bit uncomfortable.

But for the most part, it was very entertaining!"
Zumanity,"I decided to watch to show when it came out as it was said to be, The Sensual side of Cirque and it did live up to motto. I knew I was going to run into some sexual, raunchy and of course half naked bodies running around on stage and doing some erotic acrobatic moves but Ill leave that to your imagination. 

MMMmm....

It was recommended that we book on the 2nd level of the theater because wed have a better view then the front rows, plus it was less expensive so why not? The intro was unlike no other Cirque show Ive seen. The host was a tall slender drag queen that would talk to the audience and ask intimidating questions about who are they with and some sexual questions that were provocative and humorous. All the dancers were talented and I enjoyed all the acts, throughout the show Ive seen all types of body types on stage, full figure woman half naked, tall and small people and very attractive men and woman. I think it was suppose to evoke a sense of erotica sexual energy and being comfortable with the human body. I enjoyed every second of this show and still have some of the acts in my memory. 

This truly was a sensual experience!"
Zumanity,"Disclaimer: This show is not for the kiddies!

Im like one of the most reserved girls ever in terms of the topic of sex or anything having to do with subject matter that you would find on HBO, but I actually really loved this show! It was a pleasant surprise that topped off my uber exciting Vegas trip with my girls!!

When we got into the auditorium, we already knew it was going to be a little uncomfortable because a guy with large wings was eyeing us up and down as we entered the door. hahah

Inside the room, there was a man and a woman who would go around taking pictures and flirting with the audience members. It was a laugh riot from the start. Their costumes were overly outrageous and sexual. 

I dont want to give away too much of this show, but expect nudity, audience participation, girl-on-girl action, and a woman who looks and talks like she could be Liza Minnellis clone.

A true gem of Vegas shows! I really think anyone will enjoy this one."
Zumanity,"My tickets were free and I felt like I wasted my time.  

This is probably my 6th or 7th Cirque du Soleil show and Ive never left one disappointed until now.  

I was expecting raunchy acts and such, but this just seemed like an excuse to show nipples.  Not funny, just making money off of bad jokes and boobs.

The audience reaction was disgusting.  They all hooted and hollered when the two chicks were skimming all over each other in the fish bowl.  But when two guys kiss?  Its met with eww!! and the like.  Nice way to show your ignorance people.

Take my advice.  If you want a vulgar show thats *actually* funny - go see Absinthe!  Thats a class act.  Sexy and hilarious.  Skip this POS.  Theres a reason theyre giving away tickets..."
Zumanity,"I would highly recommend this show to anyone who likes the idea of an adult Cirque de Soleil show. . And by adult,  we are talking R for suggestiveness, not NC-17.  I liked that there were no crying children.  I liked that there was bawdy humor... but it seemed a little excessive at times.  I mean,  why not make it a little more subtle instead of always going for the cheap laugh?   But what really sets this show apart from the other CdS shows is the combination of the incredible acrobatic and gymnastic skills for which their performers are famous, along with the seductive,  sensual theme of the show.   Its a celebration of the sensual beauty of human form and movement.   I particularly liked the performance of the woman doing hula hoops while being hoisted above the stage,  as well as the very sensual water bowl act featuring two female contortionists set to a really pleasing original saxophone piece.  That was quite mesmerizing.
I saw the show on a business trip with a mixed group of colleagues.  So that put a damper on the enthusiasm and there was kind of a weird dynamic since it was apparent that one of the women in the group really wasnt sure she wanted to be there.   But I think it would be a lot more fun with a significant other or a close group of friends."
Zumanity,"This is an AMAZING show.  I was on the edge of my seat and grinning from ear to ear for every minute.  We chose this show over other Adult shows after reading countless articles and blogs that said that it was the #1 adult show in Vegas.  Plus, its Cirque du Soleil, adult done Cirque du Soleil is mighty tempting.  My boyfriend and I were not disappointed at all.

The show synopsis says that there is something for everyone, and this is very true.  There was a segment for gays, for lesbians, heterosexuals, bondage, S&amp;M, self-pleasure, and even something very vanilla.  WARNING:  So if you arent open about sex and all of its possibilities this is probably not the show for you.  There was contortionism, true-Cirque acrobatics, arial stunts, comedy, music, everything was extremely beautiful and tasteful.

The theatre is very small and every seat in the house is very good.  We sat in the balcony and could still see everything perfectly.

RECOMMENDATION: Get there early, there is a pre-show and it is very funny.  

If you are in the first row or two be prepared to be talked to and maybe even invited on stage by performers.  I saw a cape touch a few people in front during the performance so if that makes you uncomfortable, sit a few rows back.

I can not wait to see this again!"
Zumanity,"Such a fun show. A good mix of silly, hilarious antics with really amazing acrobatics. Beware, if you dont want to get involved in the show, dont sit in the section near the stage. They pulled a lot of people out of the audience to participate in the show. I loved the small theater, it seems like all of the seats had a good view. And the performances were just incredible. We honestly spent an hour after the show trying to decide which part was the most impressive."
Zumanity,"I am a huge Cirque du Soleil fan. I have seen O twice, Ovo, Mystere, Quidam, Zarkana and Dralion. The concept of Zumanity intrigued me because going to Vegas for the first time since turning 21, the idea of the sensual side to Cirque was one I thought would encompass the adult theme of Vegas. Dont get me wrong, it did, but with a sacrifice. I did not think the stunts were as difficult as many of the other Cirque shows. Moreover, the dancing and soundtrack did not stand out as well. However, with that being said, if youre there for a fun time, the clown hosts of Zumanity will definitely make you laugh, especially with crowd interaction. The Zumanity experience is very different from that of other Cirque shows - it is a lot more intimate. For example, the theater was small and the performers of Cirque greet you when you head into the theater when doors open.

Front row seats are going to get you a good amount of interaction so keep that in mind when booking Zumanity!"
Zumanity,"Truly AMAZING and worth the wait!

Ive wanted to watch Zumanity for a few years but it was definitely worth the wait.  You will want to go with someone (like your significant other or a person your comfortable with) who you dont mind sitting next to while they talk about SEX related topics (even sounds).

I definitely recommend you try to get seats located in the orchestra section to be a part of the show. The balcony seats are great if you want a view of everything going on. They like to select people from the audience to participate in their show. Extremely fun and entertaining. Also be willing to be caught in between the two french maids as they walk around passing our strawberries.

I dont want to spoil the show with additional comments. So youre just going to have to watch it yourself. Be prepared to be in heat during and after the show.

I would see it AGAIN!"
Zumanity,"Amazing! Beautiful, sexy as hell! Funny with unbelievable moments."
Zumanity,"Very good show. Check your shyness at the door. If you cant get through 2 guys kissing, then this show is not for you. Even the MC is a cross dressing man. The show explores a variety of sensuality and sexuality to cater to everyone. The music was very good too. I would see this again."
Zumanity,"I totally loved and enjoyed this show!!! It was my husbands first time sitting in one of their shows and i was a little scared that he wasnt going to like it. He absolutely loves it nd cant wait until we come back so that we may go to another one. Its sexy, teasful and its got plenty of laughs in it to. I strongly suggest it!!!"
Zumanity,"Pretty good show, an even mix of cabaret acts, humor, and acrobatics.
The humor was mostly juvenile and crass, which in my opinion is the opposite of sexy and sensual, which this show claims to be (it was still funny though).
The cabaret acts and acrobatic pieces were pretty good.
The only nudity on the show is some topless girls, thats it. No full nudity on any of the performers. One of the performers was even wearing a fake thong (lame).
So, super tame overall, I dont see how anyone under 90 could be offended by this, youd see more boobs in 5 minutes in any beach in Europe.
Overall an enjoyable show, but dont expect too much in the sexyness department."
Zumanity,"My wife and Is first time on Vegas and we wanted to see a show. This one was at our hotel, but we assumed it was going to be a little too raunchy for our taste. We were pleasantly surprised. 
It did have some topless nudity, but no one was having sex on stage or anything.
It was very funny and the performers like any Cirque show were amazing.
Also, you can bring a drink in."
Zumanity,"First a tip; get seats in Section 103, Row C, Seats 5 &amp; 6.  Youll be in the perfect spot to see the main performers and host. If you sit closer, or on the sofas youll probably get some interaction with the performers as they interact with the audience a lot and thats a fun part of the show. There are parts of the show that might make you feel a little uncomfortable, but thats really your problem so deal with it. Zumanity is a great show with sexy bodies, lots of laughs, and some acrobatics to keep you entertained. See this show to mix it up with the usual Cirque shows like O and Ka."
Zumanity,"Having seen several Cirque shows now, I see their commonality is basically acrobatic acts some how tied by a theme. for Zumanity, attend with an open mind as you will see the range of sexuality from fat, hot, gay, transgender, midget, and comical. If you want a chance to participate or get chosen out of the audience, sit in the front section or somewhere next to the center steps. Zumanity lacks a storyline. It is a bunch of random acts of acrobatics and sensuality mixed in with intermissions of sexual comedy. My favorite acts were the flying muscular midget, and the man-woman couple doing cheerleader style lifts and the gymnast dude on the pole doing gravity-defying poses. The girls swimming in the fishbowl and contorting was like watching something alien, and the guy guy cage fighting match that turned bi-sexual was when I cringed the most. The Fabiola-looking dude that strips down to nothing is great for the ladies, and all the bare-breasted women makes looking at boobs less exciting after a while, but its still worth keeping in the show.  

For a full storyline show, go see Ka at MGM, or even Totem, the traveling Cirque show."
Zumanity,The show was decent.  Its pretty much what I expected out of an adult Vegas show.  The host is a cross dressing guy who was a little over the top.  I could have Donne without the guys kissing though.
Zumanity,"Whew! Thats my first impression when I walked out of the show. I recommend watching this with your significant other, especially if youre in a what happens in vegas stays in vegas mood. 
It definitely heightened the sexual tension in the room and they did a good job making everything look sexy. 
It was HOT HOT HOT!"
Zumanity,"Zumanity = HOTT &amp; SEXY show!
Saw it last year with my boyfriend for my 21st bday wknd in Sin City.
It was amazingly sexy &amp; beautiful show! Must see show!
Then after the show, of course its super fun time in the bedroom. ;)"
Zumanity,"Acrobatics, singing, comedy, incredible costumes, dancing, lots of sexual innuendos, men with rock hard abs and womens boobies. Lots and lots of womens bobbies. Yup, this shows got something for every adult out there. 

Before you call me a perv, my wife is the one who picked out what show we were going to see while in Vegas, so call her the perv. 

Like I stated above, Zumanity has something for everyone. Contrary to what you may have heard, Zumanity is not all about sex. 

Well, it actually is but not in a pornographic way. Its sexy, sensual, seductive and most importantly, tastefully done. The choreographer of Zumanity did an amazing job at making sure this show is as steamy and racy as possible without crossing any major lines. Of course there were a few folks in the sold out arena who were not prepared for what they witnessed and actually left during the performance but for the most part, the crowd was really into what was taking place on the gorgeous stage. 

Some of the highlights of Zumanity are these two incredibly beautiful woman swimming in a fish bowl, a very attractive red headed girl doing amazing things with silver hula hoops, two super sexy dudes battling it out for a womans affection only to fall for each other during the brawl and of course all the crowd interactions. 

I couldnt believe the things the two hilarious MCs would get the audience to partake in. They took two random people from the audience and pretty much made them dry hump each other on stage while their significant others watched from their seats. HILARIOUS. 

If youre the type of person who gets uncomfortable in risque situations than this show is definitely not for you. If youre into risque situations, dirty jokes, intimate, steamy scenes, sexy men with rock hard abs and stunning woman with their breasts hanging out for the world to see, than Zumanity is a MUST SEE. If you look hard enough on the web, you can get good seats for reasonable prices."
Zumanity,"Oh My God!
Guys if you go to this show you dont need strip clubs anymore.
It was so much nudity and sex jokes on the stage.  
Everybody was beautiful. Bodies are amazing (such an incentive  go to the gym regularly)
Very cool!"
Zumanity,"I really thought that was a vulgar show and Im a 29 year old guy! I felt uncomfortable most of the time, and the acrobatics were not even that good. And the jokes....REALLY lame. And that Nene from Housewives of Atlanta was there...what a LOSER! Her jokes were TERRIBLE. Wish I could have my 170 bucks back, and my waste of time in Vegas."
Zumanity,"Love Cirque and have seen 8 shows. I also dont mind a little adult entertainment, but this show grew stale and anti-climactic...pardon the pun. Its fun, for a little while. Its certainly not the best option of the Vegas shows. O is the best, MJ was also great. Zumanity...is ok."
Zumanity,"It is called, the sensual side of cirque for a reason. It is!! If youre going to see this to see the topless women, go to a strip club. This is a very interesting, sensual side of cirque while still maintaining some of the sillyness from a few characters and the always wonderful acrobatic type events of all their shows. Sat first row balcony and wish we would have gotten one of the couple loveseats. Next time for sure.
If youre expecting strippers or traditional cirque, this is not for you. Great place to bring your wife/husband/sig other for a romantic evening."
Zumanity,Be prepared to be totally shocked! It is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The funniest part were the twin sisters and the rest of the show was just amazing! Cant tell too much because it is better to be surprised with this!!
Zumanity,"My husband and I saw this show in November 2015 and it was good. Honestly, I hadnt ever seen a Cirque du Soleil show, and I was expecting a little more wow factor and acrobatics. Many of the stunts were incredible, dont get me wrong, but I didnt exactly leave thinking wow.  Overall, however, I am happy we saw it. We stayed at the NY NY Hotel and the concierge was able to get us decent seats. I sort of wish, also, that Zumanity wouldve had more of a story line. This show jumps around quite a bit.
My husband had previously seen Ka and reported although Zumanity was good it was not as good as he felt Ka was.
Id recommend this show to anyone interested, but Im not sure if the show is worth the cost."
Zumanity,"I didnt know what to expect, except that, there is nudity and cursing. Neither offend me so I was excited to see a Cirque show (my first one) and I was lucky enough to attend with Molly T!, who won the tickets! First we went to an UYE at Parma by chef Marc. Dinner and a show, whos got 2 thumbs and is super excited. This girl! 
The theatre is small, but it gives you an intimate feeling. Oh, they take pictures of you as you enter the theatre. Its like high school graduation pictures. Lean forward, turn your chin, move your arms. As we were being seated, 2 characters were serving strawberries to the crowd. There was a ton of interaction with the crowd, which was cool. I was quite surprised by the language and sexual innuendos. Molly got called up to the stage for a bit. That was cool! As I was sitting, waiting for her, I kept thinking of Vegas Vacation. She got a free picture after the show for her participation. I really did enjoy myself, the acrobatics were pretty awesome, but I think had I paid full price for these tickets Id feel short-changed."
Zumanity,"Quick review:

*Ushers who guide you to your seat....definitely NOT sexy! (despite see-through clothing)

*Do not be alarmed: there is no exposed ding-dong in this show.

*Some of the songs were actually pretty good.

*French guys pink elevator shoes are hilarious.

*Lady who does the baggies sketch didnt really have nice boobs, which I guess is the point of the baggies.  To her credit, she was funny.

*Siberian hoop lady is the second best act.

*LESBIAN FISH BOWL: BEST ACT HANDS DOWN, ESPECIALLY THE UZBEK GIRL WHO DOES THE HANDSTAND INTO A DIVE!

For what its worth, although a lot of people hate on this show, I found it better than Ka.  Was fun going to the late show.  Kind of a weird show but maybe thats what made it fun.  Recommended."
Zumanity,"I loved it! I did have many drinks before this show, so I was feeling great already... but it was different than any Cirque show I had seen previously, since its adult only. The acrobatics were wonderful and, as in all Cirque shows, appeared effortless. Great performers. We were in the 2nd row and the performers definitely are topless. There are some funny adult jokes made, and overall it was very talent-filled and entertaining. A fun time for sure."
Zumanity,"Zumanity! Oh, what a performance. I watched it a cpl weeks ago through $75 lower orchestra tickets. The venue is small so I honesty feel like you can enjoy it from all angles. Its very erotic (as advertised), and I enjoyed the freedom of expression the artists allowed. Its highly interactive with the audience, which was enjoyable and brought a lot of laughs. The narration was great, the host highly suitable for the role. It was vibrant, lively, liberating, and managed to pull some stunts I hadnt seen through other Cirque performances. While leaving satisfied, I did yearn for another acrobatic act or two. Perhaps one less scene with the audience, substituted by an act? Otherwise, it was perfect!"
Zumanity,The show is so worth going to ! Full of expectations !! No need to explain too much as the show will unfold itself as soon as it starts ! Great performers and great show . Definitely would recommend it!
Zumanity,"Great show! I highly recommend it, we had a fantastic time!"
Zumanity,"Of all the Soleil shows Ive seen, Zumanity is my favorite.  Its definitely a date show and I wouldnt go with family, for sure.  Its the most crowd-interactive of the Soleil shows Ive seen and the balance between dance and acrobatics is good.  Its not as mind blowing as other Soleil shows but overall, its worth going too for a great time, a good laugh, and to kick off the Vegas mood."
Zumanity,"Your jazzy remastering KILLED all the hit songs of the show. And especially your former diamond - Mio bello bello amore song. Jazzy version of that hit single is AWFUL! And Mio bello bello amore scene was so sensual before when 2 singers made circles around the guy and now its just an ordinary act with that guy (in the much worse costume than before!) and dancers. Im so glad I managed to watch the original version on the show 4 years ago and fell in love with Bello amore. Current version is trying to be trendy about jazz, but ist just ok, nothing special, it doesnt touch soul at all"
Zumanity,"Sexy fun and little raunchy but we were very entertained and it was a very memorable show, we have seen many of the Cirque shows and this was a sexy surprise for sure!

Get there a little early and enjoy the warm up act... well worth the time and money IMO!"
Zumanity,"Ive been wanting to see this show for awhile. The host was great. The 80s couple is hilarious. I wish when we got tickets that they pushed us to get in the front rows. The cast comes out and talks to the first few rows. We had asked which seating area would be better (we were row 8 I believe...the first row in the back half.) I would have loved to be pulled on stage! Especially at the end. 
Great play on sexuality. Has a little bit of everything. Girls are topless and men/women in thongs so not a kids show. I was disappointed that there was no pole act! Im into pole fitness and thought I saw a piece in the preview so that was depressing. It would be perfect with the show. Live singing and live music was good. Good show if you have an open mind. I liked Beatles love better as far as acrobatics went. I wanted more. I wasnt expecting it to have humor either but maybe thats to lighten the mood since some people can be embarrassed with sexuality."
Zumanity,"Such a fun night!  Hubby and I enjoyed ourselves so much.  Definitely an adult show and must be relatively laid back to enjoy.  Comedy bits were hilarious.  Show was beautifully done.  Acrobatics were amazing. Great mix of humor, talent and sensuality.  Would definitely see this show again.  We were happy to have great mid theatre seats, but not too close to get taken onstage!  Front few rows beware you may become part of the show!"
Zumanity,"I rarely write reviews but I am thought I would try to save some people their hard earned money.  I went with 5 other people and we all agreed the show was terrible aside from one small performer who was incredible.  Did not find it sexy at all, more like awkward.  Tries to be funny but fails miserably.  I am frankly astonished with all the positive reviews for this show.  I was blown away by O and Mystere and I expected something along the same vein but with sex appeal.  What I got bored me me to tears.

You have been warned."
Zumanity,"I absolutely love this show, its my favorite of the Circ show.  Got the tickets for cheep and didnt expect to really like it since an adult show isnt really our thing but its actually really good.  More sensual then sexual though there is nudity.  This show is a combination of hardcore acrobatics, interesting routines and humor.  The drag queen who MCs the event is actually the best part.  The clowns are hilarious and the costumes are amazing.  

Ladies, dont be afraid to go to this show, you wont be uncomfortable.  Men if you are just looking for hardcore sex and T&amp;A this might not be your show but if you are looking for an adult show that you can both enjoy I would totally recommend this one."
Zumanity,"Do not take your kids here. Its not that type of Cirque show. The dialogue is raunchy borderline profane but with a humorous twist that is un-Cirque-like. 

This was a spur of the moment show me and my girl went to after Gallaghers Steakhouse. I knew it was a mature show, but I didnt know how far they will take it. until the opening comedic act.

There is plenty of topless nudity even some parts full. Without spoiling the plot (was there one?) lets just say that if your expecting to be taken to a mystical land like Ka or Mystere....you wont =P Its just plain adult humor and fun."
Zumanity,My husband and I visited Las Vegas and decided to see a few shows. This show was absolutely amazing!!
Zumanity,"I was weary because of the sensual side to it, but this is easily one of my favorite Cirque shows. You have to go in expecting anything, but the side and in-between acts were funny, and the acrobatic talent was amazing. There was a good mix of different acts and even if youve seen most Cirque shows, this one certainly wont bore you. I really liked the crowd involvement. The theatre itself is unique as well!"
Zumanity,"I didnt want it to end! Breathtaking, funny, sensual, erotic, exciting, visceral and eye-popping are the words that come to mind. Even the music from their orchestra was excellent. The only downside is you arent allowed to photograph or record but overall it was still a five-star performance for me. Id see it again."
Zumanity,"Seeing as Ive been reviewing my recent Vegas adventures, I should probably get this one out of the draft burner.  I have a habit of letting drafts collect dust on Yelp.  So allow me to finish my four month old thoughts:

Zumanity is said to be adults only, but its no Absinthe.  It caters to adults with a few raunchy jokes here and there.  And it caters to Vegas with a few topless acts.  But for the most part, its very tame and even a bit campy.  I didnt find the show pushing the envelop on anything and it didnt appear at all sensual to me.

I brought the boyfriend.  he enjoyed himself but didnt see why I fuss over Cirque du Soleil so much.  On reflection, I should have taken him to see something a bit more awe-inspiring (like O).  

A lot of the comedy is just heckling the nearby crowd.  And a lot of the acts highlighted in the program were absent during our particular show.  No midgets, no fat twins.  Perhaps that would have added some flavor to an otherwise lackluster evening.  Maybe I was suspecting something too outside the norm and my expectations were bridging on pornographic?  To me, this was a typical Cirque show with some dirty jokes and sexier outfits thrown into the mix.

50% off tickets for military.  So a good deal to fill a few hours of your time."
Zumanity,"The Cirque act that isnt really Cirque

While in Vegas over Labor Day Wknd, came to see Zumanity - high expectations of fantabulous Cirque shows of the past, mixed in w/ a bit of Adult themes &amp; were off to an extremely unique &amp; breath-taking experience.....or so we thought

To sum it up - the acrobats at  Cher the following night, were more amazing

Overall, too much boobie - not erotic &amp; it quickly got to the point we were like oh look, another topless girl doing backbends

Most of the guys seemed to be of the stripper variety &amp; not really Cirque performers....obviously there *were* guy acrobats but they seemed the minority rather than on equal footing w/ the girls

But - as far as sexual tastes &amp; quote  taboos  go, there was a little something for everyone.....girl on girl, guy on guy, bondage, auto-asphyxiation, bathtubs, orgies....you get the picture.  The acrobatics seemed to be of more the contortionists / drapey-ropes-in-the-air variety &amp; no death-wheel, trampoline of fire, highwire options.....but then again, I guess those wouldnt really be considered erotic

There were funny bits that had me laughing out loud &amp; it was an enjoyable evening but I was not bowled over w/ the oh-my-gawd-did-you-see-that kind of moments I expect from Cirque du Soleil.....I also did not come out of there all hot  bothered but more like meh, so whats next?

So glad I saw it but wouldnt want to see it again"
Zumanity,"IF YOU DONT LIKE SEX OR ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SEXUALITY- DONT SEE ZUMANITY!!! Luckily, I dont have that problem and I freakin LOVED this show. Perfect combination of raunchiness and cirque. The 90 minutes went by so fast. I would definitely see this show again. Recommended for all non prudes who want a great adult cirque experience. I sat in the first section behind the couches in the middle and had a great seat. Dont sit up close if you dont want to be picked on- one of the ladies passing out strawberries at the beginning called me out for my big titties- I love that kind of stuff but I get its not for everyone. Overall, this is one the best shows Ive seen in Vegas!"
Zumanity,"Reading the bad reviews for Zumanity made me want to right a great review.  I would gladly go see this show again, even though I know everything that will happen.  We went on our honeymoon and that show was a ridiculous amount of fun!  The performers are also extremely gracious.

If you are offended by tits, dildos, huge packages, fake fabric penises, etc.--just dont go.  Of COURSE there was crude humor.  It was raunchy!  AND FUN!

The costumes were great, the humor kept us laughing, and the acts were great!  Props to the fishbowl girls who didnt bust their faces open on the glass.  I was literally terrified that they would!  But Cirque du Soleil performers are amazeballs--end of story.

Go.  Its not a waste of money.  If you dont believe me, buy from the half-price ticket booth set up near New York New York."
Zumanity,"WOW - from the moment you walk into the theatre you are transported to a world of sensuality. This is a ADULTS only show with nudity, sexuality and innuendos. Make sure you are in your seats 30 minute before the show start so you can have some fun with the pre-show antics. Our seats were section 103, Row A 3 &amp; 4. I was introduced to Casanova Gigolo with an aisle dance and by the end of the night I was a participant on stage. Fun, innocent, suggestive and provocative. Hilarious comedy, amazing singing, incredible acrobatics &amp; dancing, stellar live orchestra. This was an evening we wont soon forget and so glad we went!"
Zumanity,"Cool costumes, sexy poses, girls dancing naked, in water, High flyers, all in seductive costumes. 90
Minutes. I liked it but once is good for me. Thanks"
Zumanity,"So you think you can dance.... Topless edition ..... Wouldnt recommend this to my worse enemy .... Minimal acrobatics, loud fake orgasms, and tacky male glitter g-strings.... Im still trying to figure out what the purpose of that goat-man was.... There was no central theme or story line.... #Snoozefest The only saving grace was the flying midget"
Zumanity,"Saw the show. Yes has nudity and language but was funny and quite beautiful. It was alright, not the best show ever but entertaining. Glad we didnt sit up front.... Or you will be fair game"
Zumanity,Enjoyed the show very much. I visited 4 cirque du soleil in  Las Vegas and few others across the US This show is far more entertaining then any others Ive seen so far. If you in Vegas must see dont leave the Vegas without it Highly recommended
Zumanity,"Zumanity is amazing!  School girls, ropes, water and nudity!  Sensual, sexy, exploratory and more.  Its a Vegas must see!

We had awesome 2nd row seats, but as mentioned by others, the venue is such that every seat is a darn good one.

Be sure to bring your camera or phone for photo opportunities before the show!"
Zumanity,Very fun show! Got comped tickets from MyVegas and they were front row center. From the beginning of the show to the end there were lots of laughs and amazing performances. My wife was pulled on stage for a bit even. The performers interaction with the audience was outstanding and very quick thinking in their feet. Had a total blast.
Zumanity,"Amazing show!! Not for the prude.. You will see a lot of nudity and erotic scenes.. And there is a lot of eye candy for both men and women so great for couples! All tasteful and well played! Beautiful artistic performances! The host and hostess of the show are hilarious.. Great fun, they pull audience Members into the show.  Must see! Not for children!!"
Zumanity,"Definitely a more sexy Cirque show. Very fun, very hilarious. Did not make me feel uncomfortable at all, but this definitely wouldnt be a show Id bring grandma, children, or Mitt Romney to. The pre-show acts were really fun. I got a lot of good laughs in and the show itself had great visuals. 3 stars because I wouldnt see it again....I would see Beatles LOVE instead."
Zumanity,Show is the best but i got the bad view side the state... maybe because  i bought ticket short time before show start
Zumanity,"Know that ANY show that takes this much work and talent to put together is pretty darn a must see.  The opening with the 2 girls in the fish bowl is SO cool.  You stay on the edge of your seat in awe with the fall in trick.  

There is a lot of audience interaction if you are sitting below.   The show itself with the combo of playful grinding toward the end will warm you up.  If you are a voyeur you will REALLY enjoy the show.  

keep and open mind and grab a drink...or two or three and you will be entertained. 

ENJOY!"
Zumanity,Worst show ever. Im surprised that cirque even produced such a horrible show. The constant suggestions that its unnatural for heterosexual men not to experiment with homosexuality or beastiality is repulsive. Constant persuasion that its ok to commit adultery is disturbing. What makes this  1000 times worse is the tactic of the cast encouraging the crowd to clap causing massive manipulation. So bad
Zumanity,"A perfect date night, or for a fun evening with friends. The acts are a good mix of laugh out loud funny and absolutely sensual. Its different from other Cirque performances, but if youre thinking about going, you probably already know that its going to focus more on sex and less on world class acrobatics. 

But if you want something sensual, Zumanity definitely cannot be beat. They dont allow anyone under 18, but if youre in Vegas with your parents or relatives, this might be a show you dont want them to come along to. 

I recommend sitting in the balcony if youre shy--the closer to the stage you are, the more likely it is the performers will interact with you, particularly during the more slapstick routines. The theater is on the small side, so youll still have a great view."
Zumanity,"Acrobatic acts + Bewbies + Hot Guys + Raunchiness+ Humor = Zumanity.

How could you not loving all of the above? 

I was not sure if this show would be any good just because of the mixed reviews. I was so happy to say, that this is one of my favorite Cirques show. The opening act was funny and raunchy. I like how they asked audience to participate more in this show.

The acrobatic acts were amazing. A lot of acrobatic acts in the air, so the further your seat is, the better the view will be. Our seats were at the left balcony area and they were perfect seats.

Zumanity is a show that celebrating sensuality, so if you are not comfortable with sex jokes, nudity, and same sex issues then this show is not for you. If you loved all the above and want to celebrate your sensuality, please see this show. They deserve more love from all of us. Amor! Zumanity!"
Zumanity,"Absolutely loved the show.  Booked one day before and still got good seats on a what seems like a selling out show.  And it sells out for a reason.  Great music,  really draws you in.  Open act really sets a mood for a good show.  And great interactions with the audience made it hilarious and spontaneity!"
Zumanity,"My husband and I laughed through the whole show.  The performers were walking all through the crowd and if you are shy I wouldnt sit in the front row.  I especially liked the fact that they had people of all shapes and sizes in the show from small to extra extra large and it was fun to watch.  Great costumes and performers, I enjoyed all parts of this show.  

We both agree that the best parts of the show were the girls in the fishbowl and the school girl with the hula hoops.  

If I had to have a complaint it would be the seats are not that comfortable, but I loved the show and would go again."
Zumanity,"All people are entitled to what their belief of sexy is, but this is not my belief of sexy.  At the risk of being vanilla or a square, this show leaves very little to the imagination, and I thought it unromantic and surly.  Sorry guys, the rope and choking scene, the pom pom dance, lame scotch baggies and lousy lines by the drag queen host, are not for me.  The water scene and tribal dances were good but overshadowed by the rest of the performance.

 I did not know there was a yelp review for this, else I would have checked first and not gone.  This is a 2 star review, because the singers had good costumes and the live music was good.  Also just about any seat in the house is a good seat here."
Zumanity,"This show was really, really good.  This is only the second Cirque show Ive seen, the first was Mystère (also awesome).  
I think it is really interesting when people write reviews that this show is offensive because they warn you when you purchase/pick up your tickets to go in with an open mind.  Its billed as the sexy side of Cirque!  Its full of kissing and touching (gay and straight), naked people of all shapes and sizes (which I personally loved.  Seeing a dozen naked models would have been lame).   It is full of sex jokes and the entire theme is sex!  Duh! 
I thought the acrobatics were awesome and the contortionists were amazing!  The comedy was spot on and the host really kept the show going.
I felt so bad for the actors/performers because our crowd was really stiff which made it sort of awkward.  The audience members who got pulled up on stage however were really great and were an awesome addition to the show.  
This is the most affordable Cirque show to go to, especially right now because they are having their 10 year anniversary sale.  I would love to see it again!  It is worth the money, but please only go if you have an open mind... really. 

(the only one negative thing is that we had seats dead center behind the sound box which would seem like good seats but the strobe light nearly blinded us a few times which took away from the show.  Seats off to the side would have been better.  The theater is so small that all the seats have a god view)"
Zumanity,"My least favorite CDS show.  Maybe I was in a bitchy mood that day, I was in town for a work convention deal so thats well inside the realm of possibility/likelihood.  That said, save your fundage and, more importantly, your precious time and either see another show, fire up a microwave TV dinner and watch the local news, watch 11 hours of Barry Manilow on YouTube, or have a nap.  If you ignore my advice, feel free to credit me one I-told-you-so."
Zumanity,"This is a fun, sexy, romantic Cirque show - with many comic moments. For us,   The girls swimming in the champagne glass is most memorable.  Its a good show with a lot going on.....

We bought the lowest price tickets and went mid week.  It was a slow night so they upgraded us to excellent seats for free.

Highly recommend for a cirque show especially if you are a romantic couple- straight or LGBT - the show has something for everyone wanting to be a tad naughty....
."
Zumanity,"Zumanity is basically a cast of gymnasts on Ecstasy:

YES there were whips.
YES there were chains.
YES there was lace lingerie.
YES there was sexy audience participation.  
YES there was a great host AKA Mistress of the Night.
YES there was something for every sexual orientation &amp; fantasy.

We did the love seats, but found it to be a bit of a strain on our necks.  It was cool to see the muscle twitches &amp; the popping veins of the athletes.  Also you get a chance to catch items from the cast-in my case, a single long-stemmed rose.

Not for everyone, especially not the kids, but I found it to be entertaining, more than WOW, I even felt slightly seduced."
Zumanity,"Its basically an acrobatic variation of a burlesque show. Its not the best Cirque du Soleil production, but it certainly is not the worst. Its definitely very entertaining, and there are some beautiful performances, such as the water bowl performance and the bath tub performance. If you are uncomfortable with nudity and raunchy jokes, this would not be for you. Theres no full on nudity, but expect topless women and men in G-strings. Sparkly G-strings. Their comedy is not for the timid either, and avoid the front row and aisle seats at all costs if you dont want to be part of the show. If you want something classier than Thunder down under/Chip and Dales, and are willing to pay a higher price for it, then this would be the show to watch. I would say that they exceeded my expectations, but I can see why many would be disappointed in the show if they were expecting a typical Cirque du Soleil performance."
Zumanity,"We LOVED this show and will be going back FOR SURE! Id even pay full price for tickets to see it.

I agree with previous reviews that if you are a prude or easily offended, DO NOT see this show. Its not for the faint of heart, but AMAZING for couples or a fun girls weekend. You also have to have a sense of humor to enjoy this type of show.

The show is sexy, sensual, funny, and still has that Cirque feel to it. The theater is quaint without feeling too small. We were on an end and it was a great experience since the show is somewhat interactive. Id love to sit in the same place again!

Add this to your list for your next trip to Vegas!"
Zumanity,"Soooo much fun!! One of my favorite shows in vegas.  Lots of talent and silliness. It is important to know what you are getting into.  I think the reviews on the more negative side are folks who dont know what to expect. It is an adult show.  It is the more casual sensual side of cirque.  The MC, a lovely drag queen, is just fantastic!  So funny with so much personality.  I have been twice and already have my next trip scheduled. 
I say I didnt have nearly as much fun in the balcony.  If you are going to go, unlike the other cirque shows that allow for seating farther away, pay the money and sit closer.  It isnt just about the nudity but the fact that it is a more intimate show and a more intimate venue.  I sat in the balcony the first time and looky-loos 4 rows ahead blocked my view, second time i was in the second row and my appreciation was 10 fold!"
Zumanity,This was my second Cirque show.  The first I saw was MJ One.  Zumanity was risque and sensual...and funny.  The theater was great. You could see from anywhere.  I won a free companion ticket off of My Vegas and took my boyfriend with me - 2 tickets for 50$ and I felt like the balcony seats were great. I could see perfectly.  I would see this show again!
Zumanity,"Sorry but we have been to a few Vegas shows like Le Dream, Jersey Boys and a few others, but for money we paid out it just wasnt worth it, they should of had more acts more action, I could have gone to a strip joint and paid less"
Zumanity,"I enjoyed the audience participation and comedy more than the acts. For a cirque show, the acts were unimpressive. I liked how intimate the venue is, pretty much a good seat anywhere, had I known, I would have  gone with the cheap tickets. I arrived about 30 minutes prior to the show, and there was a huge line to get in, it wrapped around through the casino, I think its pretty shitty that they start the show regardless of people still waiting in line, so who knows how much of the show I actually missed. The show reminded me of a less cooler version of Absinthe. It was a fun show though, I definitely had some laughs. I recommend buying the cheap seats, its worth watching at least once."
Zumanity,"This was a fantastic show! Dont come here if you dont have an open mind, but it was beautiful, sexy, interesting, and HILARIOUS!!  My boyfriend and I had a great time and I would definitely recommend this for couples who take burlesque shows with a grain of salt."
Zumanity,"You have to be liberal and have an open mind to attend this show. As it was my first Cirque show, I am hooked and will make it my position to see as many productions humanly possible."
Zumanity,"The sensual side of Cirque Du Soleil....must be 18 or over to attend. There is nudity and sexual conduct. 

I have now seen this show 4 separate times over the course of about 9 years with the most recent being this past September. Not much has changed about the show in those 9 years. Most of the actors and acts are the same. I love this show because not only does it have sexy Cirque tricks and acts, but its actually very funny. There is a pre-show where huge women are dressed as french maids and they go into the audience and find men to feed strawberries to. Their outfits make it look they they are wearing a thong (its really nude colored bodysuits though). The Emcee of the show is funny as well and there is a couple throughout the show that are also very funny. I must admit that this show doesnt have as many wow performances as some of the other Cirque shows Ive seen. There arent any trampolines or trapeze acts. In fact my favorite part of the show was the school girl hula hoop act. She would be flying around in the air while still hula hooping with a bunch of rings. She would flip upside down while still hooping. It was amazing. She is still on the posters and advertisements for the show, but she didnt perform when I saw the show in September. Im not sure if she was out temporarily or for good, but that was disappointing. 

Overall this is a fun and entertaining show. If you are looking for those wow tricks and acts, you may want to choose a different Cirque show though."
Zumanity,The show is unique. Its this weird hybrid which makes it worth watching at least once but as others have said in terms of acrobatics its not the craziest. My bf and I had free tickets through MyVegas but I probably would have been disappointed if I had paid big bucks for them. If you like boobies that arent in a strip club this is your show!
Zumanity,"Ive seen quite a few Cirque du Soleil shows in my lifetime, and this one is very good. Its very different from the classic Cirque shows. Theres more interaction with the audience, more dialogue, most of the show was in English (two songs were sung in the Cirque language) and its definitely very risque. 
I agree with the other reviewers that this show is more of a burlesque show than a classic Cirque show. There is one contortionist act, which was my favorite - very sexy and clever with a unique backdrop (I wont spoil the surprise). More dancing is done instead of acrobatics. That being said, each dance is still unique and beautiful, with gorgeous dancers doing a fantastic job. 
Come with an open mind and a sense of humor. You will have a wonderful time. And yes, you will see boobies."
Zumanity,"There are two types of Cirque shows:  1.)  traveling small shows which typically are intimate, in the round, and offer circus like things (Alegria, Kooza, Corteo) OR 2.) spectacular spectaculars (Viva Elvis, Beatles LOVE, O, Mystere).  ZUMANITY is in category one, except it isnt traveling.  Instead its at the NYNY in Vegas.  However --

-- its also in a category all its own.  Since its R-rated.  Cirque + Vaudeville humor + Burlesque stylings.  Please note I didnt say X-rated.  You wont see anything below the belt.  Just boobies.  And if youre into big round floppy boobies, or big fake salad bowl boobies -- youre going to be disappointed.  The boobies are few and far in between... and the cups do not runneth over.  In fact, deep in the show when you see a woman take to one of those stripper bars, the boobs were so small I wondered if she was a dude.

And thats not a silly thing to say in a show thats hosted by a drag queen.  In a show that gets visited by a Prince-like man in heels pulling various giant fabric flags -- apparently the opening ceremonies to the Gay Olympics.   Theres even amorous moments between players on the same teams.  So what is CRITICAL to know about Zumanity is that its not Jubilee (Fank Thucking God).  That is to say if you and your Bible cant stand anything but monogamous heterosexual sex, my oh MY are you in the wrong theater.  (Or really, maybe in the right one.)

Speaking of the theater:  its gorgeous.  Cirque always does a great job with their interiors and this one was no exception.  Its a shame it wasnt set up as a cabaret -- with tables and drinks -- because it would have perfectly matched the shows atmosphere.

Okay, so what of the show itself?  I dont want to ruin the fun, but basically our Master/Mistress of Ceremonies is hilarious.  So are his comic pals, who together, make the best clowns Ive ever seen in a Cirque show.  This is kind of a funny accident, that the funniest clowns are in a show children cant see.

Even funnier, though, are the clowns they pick from the audience and involve in all sorts of inappropriate moments.  WARNING:  if you wear dentures, you risk spitting them out at some of the gags these comedians pull.  Except for one SNLish skit about boob enhancements (which should be pulled and replaced ASAP), the fun with the audience bits remind us older viewers of Candid Cameras at its best:  catching people being themselves.  Its really that funny and worth going to the show again sometime.  I know I will return -- and try to get those seats for my friends.

But what of the visuals?  The dancing?  The singing?  The swimming?  The spinning around on wires?  The hoops?  The contortions?  Most of it is pretty good, as good as any normal Cirque show.  Not exemplary Cirque, but solid.  There was a little too much of chicks hanging around on ropes, and so the latter number (heavy breather hanging from straps) should be cut and replaced with something utterly different.

The music got a little loud at times, just as there were occasional blinding flashes of white light which momentarily illuminated the entire audience -- both of which I felt were to prevent certain audience members from falling asleep.  Heck, if you want to keep people awake, see my next note.

Its a very weird note to have to make -- in my not at all humble opinion, there needs be equal access nudity in this show.  Cirque is innovative, daring, and bold, and so I frankly expected to see some sausages swinging around at some point.  The fact that only tangerine cupped women were exposing themselves... didnt... feel... fair.  Half the audience were women... and so why didnt half the audience get to see the third leg of at least one man?   What a ripoff.

That said, and Im surprised Im saying this, Cirques ZUMANITY is one of the best Cirque shows in Vegas.  You heard me right.  ZUMANITY trumps LE REVE and KA -- and its cheaper than both.  ZU is more memorable and recommendable to adults than MYSTERE, even though MYSTERE is fun in its own way.  Only LOVE and O trump ZU, but they are spectacular spectaculars... and so that makes sense. 

Im giving this 4.7 stars.  It would have gotten five, but too often the show plays to the front center and utterly ignores the side seats.

;-)"
Zumanity,"if you dont want to be picked on, dont get the rockstar love seats near the front!  

but it was so much fun!  our group of gals wanted to check out a cheeky show and picked zumanity.  i thought it would be ka or o like but no...it was very interactive, playful, and humorous.

there was only one scene where the male performers seemed checked out but otherwise, there were some incredibly sexy and sensual scenes.  

awesome = we also had a great crowd that brought in lots of laughs.

they have piccies they take pre-show that you can buy for yourself at $44 for one or $40 for 2 or more in a zumanity frame.  we loved ours with the feathered boas so we had to spurge.  its vegas after all.

tip: on a budget? do the free photo booth near will call and get it emailed to yourself.  its on a timer so you can step back and strike a pose."
Zumanity,"I am reviewing all the Cirque Vegas shows, so I will add this paragraph comparing each one. I have seen each one twice (and saw LOVE 3 times), so I feel confident in my ranking. My ranking would be 1) Ka 2) Love 3) O 4) Mystere 5) Zumanity 6) Viva Elvis. Ka is the most technically complete, with a storyline, amazing stunts, creative images, stages rotating on axes, etc.  LOVE is the most fun and a very close second place.  O is the most beautiful. Mystere has the best stunts and is most traditional. Zumanity is the sexiest, but stunts are just okay. And Viva Elvis could be sooo much better.  You can read my other reviews for more info...

You need to have the proper expectations when you go see this. Dont expect a strip club or Crazy Horse style experience, and dont expect the great quality of stunts youd find at some of the other cirques. It falls somewhere in between. BUT its a good show. Its sensual and humorous and a fun time. Make sure to get there early to watch the pre-theater interaction with audience members. 

All the seats are good, so no need to pay extra. Ive sat at the top and still was able to see well. The fishbowl scene was a highlight as well as the tub scene and the contortionists."
Zumanity,"BOOBS .. that is all this show is about .. lol, well not really... they do show a lot of boobs though ... just a warning.

Zumanity was hilarious.  Yes its not as acrobatic as O or Ka (which I have seen so I can compare) but its entertaining.  I was laughing for about 70% of the show.  If you go in having low expectations, you come out smiling and happy that you gave it a chance.

On an entertainment scale I rate the Cirque shows that I have seen as the following:
1. LOVE
2. Zumanity
3. O
4. KA"
Zumanity,Very raunchy show with good humor &amp; amazing acts. It had something for everyone in it. I personally loved it ! I was a bit sad the hula hoop girl wasnt in the show since I saw the preview for it! I am a hula hooper myself. Fun girls night out .. Take your hubby if youre in town!
Zumanity,"Wahoo! A cirque show that didnt make me wanna slit my wrist or stare at my watch!

Zumanity is the best Cirque show, ever. Sexy, crass, raunchy, exotic, sexy, spicy, funny, and erotic. It is the VEGAS side of Cirque... Sensual, not so much...

The cast is beautiful, talented, funny, and charming. The show is MCed by a drag queen. Then goes on to explore sex. Gay, straight, lesbian, props, its all there! Definitely go to this show with a lover... Youll have a lot of fun and strike up some creative ideas and places to do your thang.

This show is more topless than anything. As far as the men go, its all butts, no nuts. As in most (all in my opinion) Cirque shows, there is no real story, just an overall theme."
Zumanity,"This was my second time seeing Zumanity. I talked it up to friends who were reluctant. So I was embarrassed &amp; disappointed in the drastically downsized act. Almost all of the aerial acts of the show were gone. I was sad to hear the same jokes from the hostess. I thought it was clever improvisation the first time. At this performance, she forced the same jokes into the act whether they fit or not. so sad. It definitely was not as good as I had remembered. My friends said it was okay because they didnt have the original for comparison."
Zumanity,"This show was disappointing. 

I saw this about 6 years ago and all I remember is this feeling of dissatisfaction. 

Cirque du Soleil is a brand name, its a label. Ive seen some good Cirque shows but this is definitely my least favorite. It was boring, slow, and unimpressive.

Some of the acrobatics were entertaining but most of it felt like waiting for something to happen.

I would advise going to any other show. If youve seen all the other shows in Vegas, then sure, why not."
Zumanity,"Saw this in 2009. It was my first Cirque show, and I was so impressed. Got great seats in advance. The venue itself was small and intimate, a lot smaller than I expected. I also did not expect there to be so much live audience participation, but you cant go if youre shy... often they pick the people that shelled out the most money to sit at the front to go on stage and engage in dry humping or some other embarrassing but entertaining act. It was like a comedy show + the awesome/half naked acrobatics. I loved it!! Haha. I dont want to give anything away, but its definitely worth it."
Zumanity,"Im convinced this is the planet Lady Gaga is from.

What a show! Ive only seen two shows in vegas and this was the second and boy was it... sexual. There is no holding back in here, no topic is off limits and the end of the show leaves you very... satisfied.

I went in not knowing what to really expect besides nudity and crazy acrobatics but it turned out being pretty damn funny too. There is a lot of audience participation and the show definitely ends with a bang haha.

After leaving the show sex was definitely in the air... While waiting in line to buy a drink at a bar close to the theater entrance some random drunk chick walked up to me and asked if she could lick my face. I mean, Im not gonna NOT let some chick lick my face, it is Vegas. That quickly turned into a zumanity style kiss that tasted like a strawberry daiquiri.

Fellas, I guess the pro tip would be if youre not going to see the show, chill by the bar near the show and wait for all the drunk and sexually excited women to swarm out.

Gotta love Vegas."
Zumanity,"Just so-so.... We saw this show on 5/23/14. Had loveseat tickets that we paid a premium for, but they were to the left of the stage and near the back. Saw NOTHING going on at the back of the stage. When the show started, they forgot their mics, so we had no idea what was happening for the first 15 minutes....the music was loud but good... The acts werent that impressive, other than the contortionist and the little man flying through the air. They could have kept the two fat girls.... Added nothing to the show... And the black girl only had African dancing skills? The audience participation was cute, but any of it that happened at the beginning was lost on us. If you get comped, take it... Otherwise,, save your money.... A drink was $13! Absinthe at Caesars was a better show."
Zumanity,"I didnt like this show at all.  My husband wasnt a fan either.  In fact there were a couple of times I considered leaving but I stayed hoping for more, plus we paid a lot to be there!  I wasnt sure what the show was trying to accomplish.  It wasnt sensual, it wasnt sexy and it wasnt hot.  I truly didnt even see it as artistic.  It was naked - thats about it - so if thats your only requirement, then youre in!   They covered  2 dudes kissing, 2 girls swimming in a bowl topless, some girl making moaning noises on a rope (yeah - weird!), a girl trying to seduce some guys more interested in a sports game and a couple flirting.  Then in the end they had the same people on stage at the same time.  They had a drag bring in some of the audience for participation and that was a big potion of the show.  The end!
There were about 2 spots in the performance where people actually had acrobatic talent and the rest just seemed like naked time filling.  One guy with a mohawk cut was amazing and that part of the show was great.  He had amazing strength and literally looked like he was floating in mid air, he was so graceful.  On the flip side, I think they had one girl whose only job was to stand there and make cracking noises w/ a whip and a long haired dude who I think his role was to look like Fabio in jean shorts?  This review makes the show sound a lot more exciting then it is...it really isnt something I would recommend.  Spend your money on something unique - its Vegas so you can see topless anywhere."
Zumanity,"My husband and I both enjoyed this!! I was able to find cheaper tickets on the New York, New York website. At that time (not sure about now) they were offering cheaper tickets for certain dates. One of those dates worked perfectly for us. Great show, we would definitely see it again."
Zumanity,Would be a higher rating had there not been open mouth male kissing. Enjoyed the sexual environment but that was totally disgusting and changed my view of the whole show.
Zumanity,"This show is definitely not for the faint of heart or people who dont like sex. 

The show is fantastic. As a Vegas resident I bought the package deal they had that included two tickets for $99 and since we went for Valentines day they included two drinks. You must be 18 or older to see the show, but you wont regret it. We had third row orchestra seats and they were great to see every aspect of the show. 

The show is funny, sexy, and they have great audience interaction. The guy I sat next to was chosen to come up on stage near the end and it was just hilarious. His girlfriend laughed a lot while he was on stage and the audience was exceptional for this showing. 

I would highly recommend seeing this show if you are able to as it is fun and just a really good time!"
Zumanity,"WOW!! I was invited to Vegas for an all expenses paid trip by a good friend, to celebrate another friends 21st birthday. The first night we all arrived we had tickets to see Chippendales, that review will be next. None the less that is a different kind of show, we were very loud at that one.

The second night was Zumanity, and to my surprise a ticket had been purchased for me! I had not read up on it or anything so I really did not know what to expect. It had a fantastic opening, I wont tell to much because it was so amazing, I dont want to give it all away. I have to say it was naughty, fantastic, beautiful, sexual, mesmerizing, enchanting, hilarious, incredible, intense, stunning, and there was so much talent! The costumes were spectacular! Really well done!

Having been at Chippendales the night before, I may have gotten a bit carried away, or not. They said at Zumanity, the more noise you make the more the performers know you appreciate what they are doing, thats all I needed to hear for me to make some noise. I wanted to switch it up from my usual, and suddenly Charo came out of my mouth. Reminded me of her in retrospect. Do not know how to explain the sound in letters. I was loud, my friends even looked at me and one of the performers whom I call Breakfast at Tiffanys, glanced in my direction and smiled. I was louder than the instruments. I had to remind myself I wasnt at Chippendales. It was a blast.

I have to say it was one of the most amazing shows I have seen in a really long time. If you get a chance to see it and the human body doesnt bother you go. It is really fantastic!"
Zumanity,"This is adult Cirque du Soleil and I LOVED it! I saw this show with six girlfriends right after we all turned 21. Id seen other Cirque shows before and always greatly enjoyed them... this show had all the same exciting acrobatics, gymnastics, balancing, displays of superhuman strength, etc but in minimal clothing ;) A lot of the girls were topless and the guys were almost naked but in little briefs. During the pre-show, some larger ladies dressed in maids outfits served strawberries off a platter while putting their breasts and butts in the audience members faces... very entertaining!

The tickets were less expensive than the other Cirque shows and this was a fabulous show to see with friends. While at New York, New York we also tried the roller coaster which I thought was over-rated and explored around. As an added bonus, a photographer took an amazing photo of the group of us and we bought it. A great memory of a great show (Zumanity) and a great trip (Vegas, baby!)."
Zumanity,This is the best show Ive seen in Vegas. My wife and I truly enjoyed it.
Zumanity,"By Circ shows the price is good.  The show is slightly above average but once you see all circ shows this is the middle of the road. Good start for someone who has never been to one and the prices are reasonable.
For those who are ok with spending alot more Go see LOVE  at the Mirage."
Zumanity,"I felt gross after watching this show.  I dont know....I just dont know.  

I felt like I was jipped with my money.  The only reason why hubby and I went to see this Zumanity was because Mystere and the other better Cirque shows were sold out.  So we settled.  We shouldve gone somewhere else.  

To get straight to the point. 
1) too much comedy
2) the biggest reason of all, BARELY ANY ACROBATS compared to what Cirque shows should be.
3) the music wasnt all that, and didnt complement the show.  Mystere has great live music.  Give them a try instead."
Zumanity,I loved this show its very sexual but hey its vegas!!! I recommend this show to any couple!! The theater is not too big so anywhere you sit is great.
Zumanity,"This had the same skill level as other Cique du Soleil shows with an edgier/adult side to it. My wife(23) and myself(26) decided to goto this show on a whim because it was out last night in Vegas. We both absolutely loved the show! 

As for the tickets, we went to vegas.com and scored lower orchestra tickets for the same price as upper balcony! And to save $15 on a $150 (2+ tickets) purchase we found a promo code on google.

Check this show out, very entertaining!!!"
Zumanity,"Extraordinary! In true Vegas fashion, this adult show offered something appealing to everyone. It included exciting, sexy, powerful, and seductive performances, even tossing in a comedic spin &amp; interacting with audience members. Loved it!"
Zumanity,"More penis needed, please!  Someones earlier review dubbed this show Zumani-TITIES and I agree.

I saw so many titties that Ive gotten turned off to the idea of EVER turning lesbo.

Hell, I see my own titties every day, so I dont need to see any more than I have to.

This show is great if you appreciate the feminine physique (if youre a guy), but left me without a huge climax.

Sadly, even the hot guys they had looked effeminate/workers at Abercrombie and Fitch.  I shouldve just taken my money and gone to a male strip show.

REVIEW #158"
Zumanity,"Had its moments of humor and skill, however, it was not my cup of tea. It has a weird orgy like vibe and something about it just doesnt seem right. Disappointed it was a cirque du soleil production."
Zumanity,"Ive come to love the Cirque du Soleil, and seeing an adult show that manages to be either humourous or tasteful the entire time is a delight.

Not only is there great routines, but Cirque always has audience interaction.  Theres some great moments from this, pre-show and throughout.

It was sexy and surprising, intense and fun.  

Do try sitting up front on the sofas.  Something about this mad, erotic display when youre on a sofa enjoying a cocktail adds to the experience. :)"
Zumanity,"This show was fun, but I have to admit it was not nearly as risqué as I thought it would be per other Yelp reviews. We got MLife cards (which paid off more than once) and got a pretty good deal on tickets. There isnt a bad seat in the house, but I think its worth it to pay to be on the lower level closer to stage. If you are seeing this show for acrobatics, reconsider. This is not that type of Cirque show. Its a good time, but certainly not as high production as O or Mystere."
Zumanity,"Got a great deal on Vegas.com. Sat in the dead center just behind the sound control board. Ive seen nearly every Cirque show in Vegas and decided to have a date night for my final night in Sin City and check this show out. It was unique - as all Cirque shows are. I would say its more of a cabaret show than Cirque if Im being honest. Its good, a little strange but theres some very interesting audience interaction that is worth a laugh or two. The reviews that said it made the viewers randy confused me. While this is the sexual side of Cirque, it wasnt enough to make us want to run back to the room. I suppose if 50 Shades of Grey does it for you this will too. Both were a little over-hyped on the oh so sexual you must be done immediately end of the spectrum for me. All in all - its worth seeing, but dont go with your mom."
Zumanity,"My bf and I went to see this 11/17/14. It was sexy and fun! Lots of boobies and super talented people! The hosts were really funny, but I would of preferred less of them in between acts. Its like you watch this sensuous act and get all caught up in it and then BAM youre confronted with silliness! Id rather stay in that sexy moment for a bit :) The theater is really cool and it looks like all the seats would be great!"
Zumanity,"Meh. This was my 5th Cirque show, and it was the worst. 90% dancing and 10% of acrobatics. I get the appeal, burlesque. However, I feel that people are distracted with all the boobs bouncing around to actually recognize that the show wasnt as extraordinary as you would expect a Cirque show to be. The music was cheesy, I had flashes of Rock of Ages and Im not quite sure what the point of the male stripper was as it wasnt even good dancing (disclaimer: guys dancing in speedos not a turn on for me. However, if he fixes my garbage disposal I will swoon). Cute and funny at times? Sure. Jaw dropping performances? Nope."
Zumanity,Just watched it and it was amazing under my opinion. Must watch if you are comfortable with vulgar language and some nasty moments.. The acrobatic numbers are one of the best I ever saw and the whole show is between ahahhaha how funny! And Wow wow wow what an amazing job what is a Great combination and always works for a great show. 100%recommendable. Cast ! You killed it
Zumanity,"we decided to see the show on the spur of the moment, and snagged discounted tickets at the Half Off ticket booth (hint: get to the booth early, as the line mover very sloooowwwwly). 

We elected to sit on the balcony, 4th row, and Im glad we did. The stage itself is like a tear drop, and about 5 feet high - so sitting in the first few rows does not necessarily afford you a full view and appreciation of the performance. But it will put you in the front lines of being picked on, questioned, or actually pulled into the show. So, you decide. 

Overall, it was fun, enjoyable, amazing to see what human bodies are capable of - the show is erotic, but primarily in a sensual kind of way: there are some raunchy jokes and insinuations, but again, this is for adults, so if something like this bothers you, skip this venue. Otherwise, be prepared for songs, dance, swimmers, flying acrobats, romance, raunchy humor, drag queens, little people, and a lot of skin. 

Get to the theater early: you can take pictures with some members of the cast: and they are all a FINE human specimen, oozing sex appeal."
Zumanity,"Ive seen this show twice, once with my husband and once with my mom (and yes that was awkward). I really enjoyed this show because it is so funny! It still has the shock and awe of Cirque acrobatics, but it has a lot more humor (and sex!) than other similar shows.

I also love all of the audience participation. The actors pull people out of the crowd and shamelessly embarrass them.  Its pretty great! 

You do have to have an open mind when you see this show, though.  Its pretty graphic and there are some...shall we say...alternative acts in there. One of the funnest shows on the Strip."
Zumanity,Sexy Cirque show. Check out peep holes in the hallway. We had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.
Zumanity,"Meh, I was entertained. Zumanity isnt nearly as immersive an experience as O or Ka, but it was fun for what it was. Some of the performances were much better than other, but the crowd interaction really helped keep the show interesting. I would recommend going to see this show after seeing one of the bigger production Cirque shows first. 

Also, I dont know if there was just a strobe light directly in front of me, but the strobe effects had me looking away every now and then to avoid a headache."
Zumanity,"Zumanity was disappointing and is so not worth your money! Having seen Ka, which is epic, inspiring, and amazing, I had really high expectations for another Cirque de Soleil show. However, Zumanity is all filler, no thriller. I dont understand why this show has such high reviews. Those people must never have seen any other Cirque shows to compare to this. The acrobats, while very talented, are not even in the same league as the incredible performers in Ka. They are like the sad understudies that end up performing in a local circus for kids birthday parties. There were no moments that took my breath away and I didnt see anything that I hadnt already seen before, and more importantly, seen performed better. Zumanity is comprised of a bunch of random acts that are just thrown together with no story line. The only common thread that ties everything together are the gratuitous boobs and ass. The sketches between the performances reminded me of bad SNL skits. I think they are just relying on the shock factor of the sheer amount of nudity present in the show. The actors do things to embarrass audience members like wave a fake penis in their face and other crude things to get a laugh from the crowd at the expense of whoever is sitting near the front. Nudity does not offend me, but when it doesnt serve a purpose it just makes the entire performance seem crass. The humor was very juvenile and I felt like I was watching a bizarre community college production at a strip club. I was pissed I paid so much for a ticket to see a bunch of sad adults run around a stage waving dildos and bananas and humping old ladies. Also, if you end up sitting next to a stranger and they get really aroused, it gets SUPER. AWKWARD. Sigh...One of the acts was a guy breakdancing. Seriously??? My husband can do the same moves and I can see that for free!

Cirque de Soleil should really reconsider attaching their name to a show of this poor caliber. The theater is very small and uninspired. Lots of empty seats and we didnt have to wait in a long line to get in, which is probably an indication that its the least popular of the Cirque shows. The lack of a crowd outside should have been my first big hint that it was going to be a total bust. Zumanity just doesnt live up to the Cirque de Soleil reputation. Dont waste your time or money seeing this show."
Zumanity,"I can see the points being made in the 1 star reviews... but I guess knowing what it was going in helps set the right expectations for what this show is. 

I barely consider this a cirque show and maybe thats the major failing here - branding it cirque.  Yes its a bit more like a burlesque show and looked at it from that aspect is a superdoopercrazyamzingassed burlesque show erasing all memories of others Ive seen in my past.   The reason its superdoopercrazyamzingassed is because of the cirque infusion... but to compare it based on that mere infusion to a full show it will be a bit weak. 

Your clowns are women in fat suits that walk the line of inappropriate for fat people or for strangers in our average society.  The host is a drag queen that likes to rag on gender stereo types.  There are mainstream, slight risque and homosexual themes.  Its hilarious, its beautiful, its sex positive,  it celebrates diversity and feels like a celebration of sexual freedom to me.  Much of the show is pushing people just beyond comfortable (or comfortable in regular society).   Nothing was shocking to my eyes but I know there were people who saw things that pushed them way past their personal areas of comfort.  I thought it was sexy but not shocking and I am glad I saw it in a couple.  This doesnt seem like a show to go to with friends or as a single really.  I really like the lack of fake breasts in this show... my opinion would be very different if the performers were cosmetic surgery regulars and not the very athletic and naturally beautiful performers youd find in a cirque show.

For seats,  sit in the center.  Most cirque shows are good at using a round stage but this one is not.   It beats me why the exact middle of the room is an aisle all things considered because those were the best seats.   If you sit in the middle, up close or on a duo sofa thing you will end up in the show.  I thought the audience members in the show were hilarious but Im really glad I didnt get pulled in there.    I knew about this in advance and picked row F on the aisle in the center and I was still sweating as audience members were being picked out from my row just over the stairs.  You can decline but they dont give up easily.... so if youre really shy you might want to avoid the aisles and stay at least 10 rows back.  You might also want to do the balcony to be completely safe.  

My recommendation for this show is highly conditional.  Im glad I saw it, wouldnt see it a second time and I dont think its for everyone.   I wouldnt use this to judge cirque if its your first show and I wouldnt compare it to others if you seen them.  If you like what people ACTUALLY describe it as,  set the cirque brand aside and see it from that place."
Zumanity,sleazy. two decent five minutes of trapeze and the girl who performed in a glass. The rest was embarrassingly bad soft porn.
Zumanity,"Zumanity is a highly entertaining show.  Its sexy and intense one minute, dirty and funny the next.  This is the only show where I was compelled to google the casts.  I really enjoyed the performance of Wassa Coulibalys African dance.  It was the most intense dance Ive ever seen.  

Two performances gave me goose bumps because the themes were out of my comfort zone BUT both were tastefully done so it was really interesting.  

Discount tickets are available at Tix4Tonight.  I recommend the branch at Town Square mall."
Zumanity,"A fun, risqué, sensual, sexy side of Cirque du Soleil and it was incredible.  I didnt know what to expect going into this but it was very enjoyable and I liked experiencing it with my husband.  Be prepared that this is an extremely intimate sexual show thats not for the faint of heart and that nudity is present... a lot. The costumes were beautiful, the acrobats were amazing, the acts were incredible and they interact with the audience a lot.  A true must see!"
Zumanity,"Great show!  Funny, risqué, awesome performances.  Husband and I saw it during our 20-year anniversary trip to Vegas.  We wanted to see a show that took advantage of our kid-free weekend.  We had great seats in the second row so were incorporated a bit into the pre-show antics.  Super fun evening all in all.  If anything I could have done with more cirque (amazing athleticism!!) and a little less of the risqué asides (funny but not as impressive) but would recommend this show."
Zumanity,"Had an amazing time at the show. I sat in the second row, behind the love seats. I loved that they play and include the audience.  My boyfriend was picked on multiple times and I thought it was hilarious. This was my first time in vegas and the first show I saw. It was amazing. I loved it and would go over and over again. Expensive but a great time."
Zumanity,"Open up to your kinky side (if you have any). Definitely not for prudes - stay away from this one! But if you have a sex-positive attitude, sense of humor, appreciate good entertainment and like humorous acts at the border of vulgarity - go for it. 4 stars because its not as good as O or KA"
Zumanity,"I have seen a number of shows and a number of Cirque shows since I have lived in Vegas. This show was good, but it wasnt what I would consider Cirque Good. It is a very entertaining show, nice crowd interaction comedy interspersed with some music singing and other talent performances.

I am fortunate enough to have a friend in another Cirque show who got us some comp tickets for last nights show. I dont know if I would have liked the show as much had I paid full price for the tickets. 

As mentioned, it was an entertaining and good show. It just wasnt *Cirque du Soleil Good* in my eyes."
Zumanity,"Unfortunately I cannot give Zumanity more than 3 stars. Acrobats and costumes and music were great, but the jokes were just not appropriate and unnecessary. It spoilt the whole experience. I was expecting more from this show. And I thought it was a way overpriced."
Zumanity,Most of the acrobatics was awesome.  I was fully aware this was a suppose to be a provocative show but was not aware that it more oriented to the gay crowd.  Parts of the show were very funny and entertaining but some not so much.  My husband was appalled and disgusted.  I would not recommend this show to heterosexuals.  We were so disappointed in this show and the fact we wasted our money and time on this performance over the many other choices available.
Zumanity,"This show opens with hilarious overweight twins in nude suits hitting on audience members! I came here with 3 really good friends on a girls-only trip to Vegas, and Zumanity was one of the first on our list. We had seats in the third row, and I had a great time.

The dancing in a lot of the scenes was sensual, beautiful and graceful. The Zumanity cast was chock full of energy!

The water bowl dancing was so seamless and in-sync, that I held my breath throughout a good majority of it for fear that I would disrupt them! I dont think I blinked.

I was too distracted by the dancing and hilarity of the performer-to-audience interaction that I wasnt even following the concept of their skits or whether it even made sense. It was definitely a playground of opportunity for thats what she said. A lot of sex, a lot of birthday suits, a lot of cross-dressing for sure. It was all very interesting and is definitely not your every day, run-of-the-mill show."
Zumanity,"Is a trip to Vegas ever complete without a visit to a Cirque du Soleil show?  I think not.

Whats a trip to Vegas without seeing some naked girls swimming and writhing in a giant human-sized fish bowl filled with water?

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment youre sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

Im sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If youre looking for a conservative show, this probably isnt for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up ill take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Dont get seats in the front rows if you dont want to be called on.  :)"
Zumanity,"oh Cirque you definitely delivered for my first vegas show ever!

hot men, hot women, hot sets, hot songs with amazing live vocals, hot acts and acrobatics... I cant do the show justice.  get your ass to a discount ticket kiosk on the strip, choose balcony seating, and prepare yourself to get twerked up and turned on for 90 mins straight"
Zumanity,"2.5 Stars.

DO NOT see this as your FIRST CIRQUE.  It is vastly different, and not quite as enthralling.  In fact, you wouldnt be missing much if you skipped it altogether.  Its a little out there sexually which I liked, but I thought the stunts were NOTHING compared to KA or Love."
Zumanity,"Cirque Du Soleil but only edgy and more soft core porn. Its a big orgy fest! 

The show was fantastic. The high light of the show was the two chicks that were swimming in the water. They always say you shouldnt dive into shallow pools but they did that. 

Some of the acts seem like the same thing Ive seen before, to the hula dancer to the girl flying across the crowd in bed sheets. But than again they are naked, well boobies and all. 

The singers were great as the band. Im not sure how the band can stay on a bridge above the stage and not drop anything. But hey whatever.

The funny parts of the show were the clowns. The Scotch Boobies was a funny skit as well as the interaction with the audiences. The big girls, they were funny as well when they interacted with the audience. Dildos were used. 

I wasnt big on the seats. Should have spent the extra money to get to the bottom.

**Guys if you go with your girl friend make sure you cover your GFs eyes when the muscle guy comes out and starts ripping of his clothes. **"
Zumanity,"Awesome. Stunning. Beautiful. Steamy. Sensual.

An exploration in sexuality and eroticism. Warning: homosexuality is celebrated along with other risque topics (S&amp;M, bondage, etc). If youre a couple looking for a great time, try to get the sofa seats. The performers will choose some of you to be a part of the show. So if youre no extrovert avoid these seats."
Zumanity,"Watched this show with the wife...  Weve seen quite a few of the other Cirque shows (O, Ka, etc.) and have also seen the regular circus when it came to a local venue.  With that being said, the only thing really different about this show is that it is more adult themed.  The only thing that I would say is really unique are the women in the fish bowl performance.  But, pretty much all of the other acts can be seen in other cirque shows or even at a regular circus (think Ringling Brothers).  So for me, there wasnt really anything that made Zumanity it stand out and be something that was totally amusing (except for the fact that theres nudity, adult humor, etc).

If you havent seen a lot of circus acts and wouldnt mind seeing it in an adult themed environment, this would definitely be entertaining because the comedy in the show is hilarious.  It was probably the only thing that really kept me interested.  Every time the blonde lady was doing a skit, I was cracking up.

FYI - if you sit up in the front section, be prepared to participate, because they were calling people out.  Funny for the rest of the audience, but somewhat embarrassing for those who got selected.  Everyone in our show time were good sports about it though."
Zumanity,"We went to see Zumanity when we were in Vegas and we really enjoyed it. Is it the best Cirque show? No, but it is good. We loved the way they blended sensuality, sexuality, acrobatics and dancing together to form something different. That combination is what sets this show apart. 

I have to agree with other reviewers that if you are easily offended by sexuality, nudity, alternate lifestyles or vulgarity, this is not the show for you. Do yourself a favor and go see one of the other Cirque De Soleil shows on the strip. If you have no qualms with any of that or are open minded, its worth the price of admission.

I will say that I had wished we had better seats. We bought our tickets through a promotional package. Our seats were in the balcony section. I would have rather been on the lower level closer to the stage not only so we could see some of the performance better, but also in hopes we could be one of the audience members pulled onto stage. That was part of the fun of this show, was the audience participation either before the show started or during the show. I learned my lesson. 

The entire show was entertaining, made us laugh and was just fun in general. 

I will also say thanks to this show, when we returned home I bought my wife a bunch of hula hoops and a short plaid skirt. Oh yeah!"
Zumanity,I had always wanted to go to a Cirque du Soleil Show but thought most were too family friendly I guess you can say. This show was amazing. We laughed and was awed by all the performers and atmosphere. Its a great show to snuggle up with honey and have some drinks. I must warn you this show is not for everyone since it is a bit racey and hot.
Zumanity,Excellent show that is not for kids or childish people.  If you dont have an open mind or shy away from nudity then you will not like this show because it is a burlesque show.  Enough said.
Zumanity,"On a whim and some strong yelp ratings, the wife and I decided to see Zumanity while in Vegas.  To say that it is a sensual experience is an understatement.  It is an amazing blend of sexuality, sensuality, humor and the physicality that Cirque is so well known for.  Unlike some of the other Cirque shows that seem to get lost in their thematic process, this show stayed very true to its mission of sensuality and the expression of our sexuality.  

Some Cirque shows overwhelm you with the sheer magnitude of the staging (O and Ka come to mind), but not Zumanity.  The stars of the show are the performers and clowns and they do not disappoint.  If you are looking to set the right mood with that special someone in Vegas, here is where to start."
Zumanity,"When planning my first Vegas vacation, everyone told me this was a must-see. After reading all the yelp reviews, Me and Buddy decided to give it a try...

We opted to NOT sit in the front section (and though Im far from shy), and sooo glad we didnt!! This show is not for the prude or sexually reserved person. I suggest going with a spouse or significant other. Ive seen other Cirque Shows and this was decent as far as the technical acrobatics and stunts. 
The acts were very sexual but also very tasteful. I enjoyed everyone from the Mistress of ceremony all the way down to the little person who had an adonis face and body....My fave were the tribal- like scene and the Water scene..HOTT!!

Every seat is truly a good seat. Intimate style venue . i enjoyed it and i think it was worth the money"
Zumanity,"The worst of the Cirque shows.  Dont get me wrong, 2 girls in a tub was stellar and there were a couple of outstanding acts.  Just not enough big tricks and too much booooring audience participation from the crossdressing MC.  The drag queen felt very amateurish and pretty much like a time filler to me.  Much more of a free show or cheap show act, than a high priced ticket.  I am a huge Guy Laliberté fan and will see anything he creates.  Im just saying Zumanity is at the bottom of his list of great works."
Zumanity,"Saw it last night and loved it!

Different from the usual Cirque shows in the way that it was more comedy and not as many death defying stunts. This show is for 18 years and older and is quite risky so if youre uncomfortable with seeing partial nudity or sexual subjects I would not recommend this show. It was still a beautiful show with all the elaborate costumes (when they had more then underwear on) and a lot going on to keep you engaged.

I sat in the balcony so I was safe from the interactions but if youre sitting on the main floor be prepared to be part of the comedy!"
Zumanity,"This was definitely not what I expected. Ive seen many Cirque shows and have loved them all. They are always very entertaining, beautiful, innovative, and classy. This one on the other hand had many extremely sexually explicit scenes, which could have been much more tasteful. Instead of being sexy and sensual, most of the show was just sex-based. A lot of people loved the show, but not my taste. If you are not interested in extensive nudity and over the top sex-like scenes I do not recommend seeing this show. I saw this show with my boyfriend and was hoping to leave feeling sexy, but I left the show with mixed feelings of respect for the performers talent and disgust at a few of the performances. Definitely not a show for everyone."
Zumanity,"Not a strip show.

For some, when they think of zumanity, they may think of sex, sex, sex, fantasy, strip show, sex, sex.

Its really not. Its like any other cirque show but with less stunts (or variety of stunts - no throwing/ catching people, tightrope, etc.) and its done mostly topless. It was a bit more engaging than corteo, for example, because the mcs did a lot of interacting with the audience.

there was this one vampire looking guy that flipped and sat and posed on the railing next to us. that was a bit disturbing, but also kind of fun. the cast really gets the audience into the show by walking around, strutting, etc. 

The host/singer has this annoying scream that I couldnt get out of my head afterwards. 

I came here with my bf and it was fine/fun. All the boobs here were real (i think) and I appreciated the diversity of the sizes, firmness, color, and texture of it.

Too bad the guys never show anything more than butt cheeks. Is that a law or something?


all in all, it looked like topless acrobats. do you want to see topless acrobats or topless strippers?"
Zumanity,"This would have been a 3 star review but I got my tickets for 50% off so theres the extra star. I dont really consider myself to be uptight or prudish and coming in I knew what the show was about so there were no surprises there. 

I loved the guy in the beginning that warmed up the crowd as well as the *married* couple that did skits throughout the show, the hostess was fab-u-lous as well.

I felt the nudity was done in a tasteful manner, I wasnt expecting the cage fighting guys to kiss but I think they managed to hit up every possible sexual interest of the crowd. 

I probably would have given these 5 stars had I not seen Ka a few years ago, I thought it was much more impressive. They did have a few acts that had a bit of a wow factor but I guess I went in expecting to much of what the typical cirque de soleil will be.

Needless to say we had many laughs and loved the interactive aspect of the show...especially when they pulled a married man and a very very drunk girl up on stage who ended up on a very small bed together...Im surprised the wife didnt run up on the stage and start a cat fight.

Anyways, I recommend it for a change of pace and if you want to get picked to go up on stage sit towards the front section of the crowd."
Zumanity,"The show was very good.  Lots of boobage and booties! haha loved every minute of it.  There was live singing since I was able to see 2 of the performers actually sing during some acts.  One thing I didnt like was the repetitiveness.  Most of the acts had the same concept.  At times there is was too much things going on stage so I got distracted.  

Defin. see Zumanity with your significant other or on a date.  Or maybe with a bunch of your girls but I went with my best friend and her bf and I felt like the 3rd wheel for sure.  You might wanna have sex after watching the show haha.  Oh yea you can take a very nice pix before the show for like $40 something dollars.  Its expensive but the pix of my best friend and her bf came out really nice.  Looks very professional shoot i guess since ur paying almost $50 bucks for it it better look nice!"
Zumanity,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and it was great....there wasnt much of a story line but other then that I was thoroughly entertained. The performers were fantastic! All of the characters had so much pizzazz . I went to school for theater so I really, really, enjoyed every aspect of the show. The nudity was nothing wild, it was fitting. It was funny, laid back, fun and I LOVED when they brought people from the audience out on stage. It was so liberating and free, GREAT show!"
Zumanity,Exceeded my expectations! Amazing acrobats! So funny my cheeks hurt! Not too risky!
Zumanity,"As a CDS fan, and one whove seen many of their shows, I cant say that this one sold me.

I knew this would be a sexual show, but it wasnt as sexual as I thought it would be; just topless female performers, very ripped male performers, sexual dancing, and a hostess in drags. There didnt seem to be a theme with this show, except, sexuality I guess. Unlike most CDS, this one was somewhat funny. They asked for volunteers, one male and one female. Of course the show I went to was funny because the female volunteer was buzzed and slutty - a very entertaining combination! The poor male volunteer was frightened and a bit confused whether he should go along with the act and risk getting slammed by his gf/wife later, or hold himself back.

What did excite me (no pun intended) was the entrance to the theatre. There were peepholes in the velvet-covered walls of the walkway that had provocative pictures; I thought that was very creative and unique. The lighting was red and dark; evoking a bedroom theme .

Of course, the performers were all amazing at their acts. Some acts were more riveting than others, but all so talented nonetheless."
Zumanity,"I honestly loved the acrobatics, costumes and performance. The host- audience interaction ruined it for me.. It became a cheap show with not very funny jokes. It also seemed as majority of the show were the interactions and not the performances. 

During the actual performances I was speechless, it was absolutely beautiful. Performers get 5 stars from me. Everything else does not.

It was just not worth 80 $ to listen and watch 2 hosts play with themselves. Seemed as they were just killing the time on the stage. Total disappointment. They ruined what could have been such an amazing performance by the all these talented dancers."
Zumanity,Pretty boring. Very little acrobatics and no story line. Just breasts and behinds. I do not recommend.
Zumanity,"Another great Cirque show! This is definitely the funniest of the bunch. The host(ess) was AMAZING, but I had to spend 90% of the show trying to convince my boyfriend that she was definitely a he. I loved the audience participation and the unexpected artistic elements. This is definitely a rated R show and PERFECT for a bachelorette party or a group of friends with a sense of humor. The theater is very small so you can get a great view from any seat."
Zumanity,"Well, the wife thought it would be a good show, and for the most part it was.  We had seen the Cirque du Soleil Beetles Love the night before, so we were disappointed in the amount of acrobatics that were in this show.  Just a lot of nudity and sexual innuendo stuff."
Zumanity,"Bad, bad, so disappointed with Zumanity show, poor, when you mention Cirque du Soleil you expect a lot! This s not my first time in this Cirques, but this one was the worst, Im from LA and  I had guests from Va. That weekend and I offer to  take  them to see this show!!  I wanted they see how beautiful is Cirque du   Soleil, wrong decision. I wish I have my money back, I spend on 6 tickets."
Zumanity,"Recently bought discounted tickets for me and my friends from Tix4tonight and we all were extremely excited to see this show. Unfortunately, we all were so disappointed. Our group were pretty diverse with both international friends and Americans, yet the humor of the show was uncanny and dry for all of us. We saw much better show in Bangkok Thailand or Holland. Circle De Soleil definitely need to re-work on this highly wanted show! I rather check out La Reve or K.A if you were looking for a good Circle De Soleil shows for a big group of friends."
Zumanity,"11/19 show - A completely different take on Cirque. 

Zumanity rounds out Cirques slew of amazing shows. Its the epitome of the modern Vegas cabaret complete with humor, sexy steamy acts, great music and lots of boobage. This is not for kids. 

I love the intimate atmosphere of Zumanity but my preference still goes towards the grander cirque shows like O and Ka."
Zumanity,"Zumanity was my first Cirque du Soleil show! I was absolutely blown away. The show contained a mixture of acrobatics, eroticism, sensuality, sexuality, romance and so much more! I heavily advise individuals to read reviews before they purchase tickets, as the show is heavily erotic and it does cater to a wide range of sexualities. Im honestly baffled by the amount of reviews that I read that claim to be disappointed about how gay the show is. The poster includes men with makeup and the show description tells you what kind of show it is. There is no excuse for ignorance or stupidity folks, check your stuff before you by something! The stage for this show was absolutely exquisite. The stage was dark red and very focal, which meant that the audience can see the stage quite well. My friends and I lucked out with front row seats. The crew members to actively seek audience participants, so if youre shy, dont sit near the stage. Finally, there are plenty moments of comedy too!!!!!"
Zumanity,"Experiencing this show while in Vegas was one of the biggest highlights of my stay there. I need to preface by saying that you should NOT see this show if you are easily offended by sexuality (homo or heterosexual). The abilities these performers possess put the average person to shame and the host had a voice I can only describe as mesmerizing. I absolutely loved this show with all of its raunchiness, humor and sensuality. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could! (P.S. The music was live and there is no such thing as a bad seat in the house - they all have superb views of the stage and the building has a very intimate feel)."
Zumanity,"Looking for a Cirque du Soleil show? 3 stars
Looking for a sensual burlesque review? 5 stars

If youve seen a couple of Cirque shows you will have higher expectations than what you get out of Zumanity. There is less variety of acts and most of the acts are versions of dance. 

If you are looking for a burlesque show with more to it than your standard T&amp;A stripper act? This is the best one youll find. 

The dancing on a bolt of silk while dangling from the cieling act is turned into a amazing performance of sensual bondage and rubber. The synchronized swimmers are a homo-erotic pair of beautiful women scintillating the voyeuristic audience in a large glass bowl. The costuming is brilliant and they were extremely successful and combining the acrobatic talent Cirque is known for with varied expression of sexuality. 

Again - if you are looking for a Cirque show, try Love or Mystere. But if youre looking for a higher-class version of a burlesque/T&amp;A show (that is couples friendly), this is the best one in Vegas."
Zumanity,"Zumanity 2014 is a shell of its former self! I first saw this show about 4-5 yrs ago and it was awesome -sexy,sultry, boundary-pushing with superb acrobatics! Fast forward to 2014- most of the sensuality and display of cirque acts have been stripped away and replaced with dance numbers that were just meh and dont invoke sensuality. Because of this I found the skits in between and the twins to be annoying. - one of 2 actual cirque acts involved an S&amp;M theme complete with a soundtrack of orgasmic sound effects. If felt a bit awkward and out of place since little had been done to create the mood or build up to this moment. Perhaps its time for Zumanity to get a prescription for those blue pills"
Zumanity,Very amazing show! They make you look at sex in funny and artistic views. It was so much fun! Something couples can enjoy :)
Zumanity,"Loved it! The best show Ive seen in Vegas. It was funny and entertaining. Dont bother seeing it if you are easily offended and prudish, though. The whole show is centered on sex and sensuality, including gasp! gay and lesbian themes. There are also kinky scenes involving a whip cracking female Dom and a solo female acrobatic scene implying bondage. The show was very different from anything Ive previously seen, and I am happy to have seen it."
Zumanity,"parking near the casino is lucky so either park and walk or do the valet.

I LOVE THIS SHOW!  Its the ONLY 21 and OVER Cirque show.  One thing that gets me happy about this show is the LIVE SINGER.  Shes so awesome, i wish she had a nice pop album to buy to show her how much i loved her singing and emotion that she caused for the show.

Im not comparing this to Beatles Love Cirque but this woman is live and she makes you feel the moves and the actions of all the performers.  I cant believe she sings like this twice a day all week.  To hit her cues, and to reach the emotion that you can feel it while they perform, its incredible.

Its a slightly more sexual show.  Its really for adults.  The clowns in the beginning they walk around with dildos in their coat pockets..so they will entertain you for the 20 to 30 minutes before the actual show starts...thats how cool that is.

I must say this though.  The two guys wrestling in the cage, that kind of suprised me, i assume it was supposed to be like a prison scene...thats all you need to know.  If you want to know more...GO SEE THE SHOW."
Zumanity,"Save your money! Way better shows in Vegas. Ive wanted to this forever and was so excited. I was highly disappointed, I would not recommend it."
Zumanity,"Very sensual and very funny! I loved their comedy act! Its hilarious! The viewers participation was absolutely the best!  

When we got here, we kinda knew what to expect. I think its worth the money! We only paid for regular admission so we sat at the back. If you purchase the expensive tickets, I hope u get stuck between the two shapely twins..lol. When they started removing their clothes, i cant decide if the mans thing was real or not! Its way too long and too thin! hahaha!
A must see! Best for bachelorette  parties!"
Zumanity,"Zumanity - the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil

I dont know if Im quite sold....

I heard great things about this show, and I was really excited to see it.  It was hot and raunchy, but some of the skits were kind of.. unnecessary?  I know theyre trying to add comedy into the mix.. but some of it was just blehh..  Random?  I was expecting sexy costumes, sexual acrobats.. I guess there was some of that.. but I was hoping for more.

The hostess.. or host.. (it was a guy dressed in drag and he was AWESOME at it!) was pretty good.  I really liked how she would engage the audience and ask, So what does this make you want to do?  Its always such an awkward response - hilarious!

The black girl with the African ensemble was freaking AMAZING.  She had the body of a goddess, and her dancing was hypnotizing.  Terrific performer.

The singing was ok.

The dancing was ok.  

More acrobatics please.  I like the fishbowl skit.. MORE OF IT!!

There was just too much talking.

In the end, I was just not turned on!  :P"
Zumanity,"I loved it! The performers were all so great, especially the host!  So much fun!  Very comical, done with class. Really enjoyable!  The singers voices are amazing! This is a must see!"
Zumanity,The show is supposed to capture sensuality! Well the performance isnt up to the mark. It didnt seem like a good fit to have acrobats mix with supposed erotica. The funny bits are so predictable you could see them from a mile. There is some audience participation but mainly from front rows. The venue is nice but thats just about it. I wouldnt mind seeing it if I have seen all other shows or am being comped :)
Zumanity,"I decided on this Cirque du Soleil show bc of the cheap ticket prices, but I have to admit, I still expected Cirque quality level. Saying I was disappointed with be an EXTREME understatement. If you want to basically see a burlesqeu show with a TON of nudity (basically EVERY girl takes her top off), un-necessary sexuality, and crued jokes, then this is the show for you! But if you are like me, and are interested in a Cirque show with amazing perfromances, precision, and talent, then dont waste your time!!! So unhappy and disappointed :("
Zumanity,"With my first experience with Cirque du Soleil, this was a great introduction. From what I hear, a lot of the other shows have a great storyline to keep you going. Zumanity, on the other hand, exposes the skill of their artists in a sexy, seductive attitude.

For each of the main parts of the show, they were smooth and elegant while highlighting the, ahem, finer parts of the body. But the in-between moments were filled with raunchy and funny skits and audience interactions that seems typical of Vegas. Everyone in the front is pretty much fair game for the entertainers to use you, abuse you, and play with you ;)

Either way youll enjoy the amazing acrobatics and the sensuality that is kitschy but if you just buy into it, youll love it."
Zumanity,"The acrobats were simply amazing.  The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that I wish there would have been MORE of the acrobatics.
Some of the random acts in between that didnt have acrobatics could have been omitted in my opinion.  They werent that funny and seemed sorta cheap.
I bought discounted tickets which I would recommend.  I dont think Id paid full price for this.  Also, we sat on the balcony (cheapest seats), which Id also recommend.  
I usually prefer to pay money for good seats, but the place where I bought them said that it wasnt really necessary.  Plus, if you are in the very front you have to be prepared to be called on stage....which I wasnt down for.  :)
Anyway, the balcony was totally fine. The theatre isnt huge so we could see just fine."
Zumanity,"I loved the interactions they had  with the audience, it was hilarious. The theatre is pretty small, so youd get a good view even if you buy cheap seats. Overall, this show is funny and sexual but if you are religious this show is not for you."
Zumanity,"If youre a prude, just stay home. 
If youre not into sexual innuendoes, dont come.
If youre afraid to see boobies, this is not the show for you.
Its not one of my favorite cirque shows but its not entirely bad either.
Its a little cabaret, a little burlesque, a little typical cirque.
The closer you sit to the stage, the more likely you will be a part of the show. If youre not up for this, then dont get seats so close."
Zumanity,"I never thought Id fine the words Cirgue du Soleil, sex and boring in the same sentence. Weve seen many CdS shows in the past and adored Love playing just down the street. Zumanity, however, was unlike any show Ive seen in the past. This had a far greater emphasis on bawdy comedy than the sublime acrobatics were accustomed to. The show had its moments...the man rolling in the ring...the flying little man...but there were far more downs than ups. The comedy bit with the scotch filled falsies was silly. The acrobatic bondage scene had me reaching to check email. The plentiful bare breasts were, in this context, not particularly exciting or even appealing. The plentiful interactions with the up-front audience were painful to watch.

If you find Ringling Brothers meets Benny Hill an interesting idea, this might be for you. I had trouble staying awake.

1.5 stars."
Zumanity,Great performance! One of a kind show! It was a bit pricey but it was worth it! (3/6/12)
Zumanity,"Going off reviews my friend and I decided to give Zumanity a shot and got a deal with the Summer of Cirque promo.

Not knowing what to expect I went into the show with an open mind.  Needless to say I was a bit disappointed.  The show seemed to drag on and I found myself bored during some of the acts. 
 
The best scene in my opinion was the fish bowl scene.  Everything else was meh... The southern lady and her husband were entertaining and added some comic relief.  If it werent for them I probably would have fallen asleep.

I guess the only thing thats appealing about this show is that they showcase nudity elegantly."
Zumanity,Absolutely the best show in vegas to date! The two obese french maid sisters that roam through the isles make the show for me!
Zumanity,"Zumanity is the least acrobatic of all the Cirque shows, but probably the most entertaining, and definitely the funniest. Have a few drinks, loosen up and enjoy!

PS. Dont take your parents. HAHA!"
Zumanity,"Ive been to many Cirque shows and this was a true disappointment.  Aside from the hype, this show does not stack up to other Cirque shows when it comes to talent.   The theatre was sumptuously decorated - so I was pretty excited when I first arrived.  But then the show started and all I can say is that the show is super cheesy.  Fat chicks scantily clad squeezing through occupied aisles pushing their butts and boobs into the faces of guests, performers constantly grabbing at their crotches, so-so singing, very little acrobatics compared to most Cirque shows, low quality acrobatics (compared to Cirque shows).   In a word, the show is cheesy - theres nothing sexy about it. 

Thankfully my other half got a deal on the tickets - the second ticket cost one-dollar. Still though, it was a waste of our money.  If you enjoy Cirque shows such as Alegria, Mystere, Kooza, Quidam and O - dont bother with Zumanity."
Zumanity,"We got free tickets to this show due to booking a room at NYNY and Im glad we didnt pay.  This was the first Cirque show Ive been to and Im assuming the others would have been a better choice.

They have a lot of crowd interaction and so if youre sitting on the main floor (especially the front row), get ready to participate. The crowd members who were brought up on the stage did a very good job and were willing to play along with what they were asked to do. Some was a little awkward but being a viewer and not a participant, we found it quite entertaining.

Acts featured a lot of female nudity and a couple of fully dressed men. Basically you see a lot of boobs. A lot. Really not what I was expecting or looking to see. A ballerina without her top on? Probably not what her parents imagined... 

Overall, I wasnt wowd and wouldnt go again. The gift shop features some fun gifts that range from Cirque souvenirs to sex shop treats. We didnt find that the shop was open unless a show had just ended though."
Zumanity,"I really liked this show! I didnt know what to expect except some nudity or a lot of nudity rather. It definitely helped that we were able to see the show free thanks to hookups from a friend. The show kept me alert and awake which is more than I can say for a lot of movies and shows. The only annoying part were the guys behind us and their commentary. Its a show people....shut up! I like that the theater was smaller than say O or Elvis...I guess its for the intimate portion of it. We sat in one of the balcony seats and we were able to see everything. I think for me, I enjoyed it so much for the entertaining aspect and the sense of humor. Overall, I would recommend it to those that are 18 and older to definitely see it."
Zumanity,"I heard this show was raunchy, I didnt hear it was ALL SEX. Do not underestimate the naughtiness. BUT... while theres breasts everywhere, theres no... tat for tit, for the ladies. Theres a weird male strip tease that ends with everything covered--that part was odd.

I ended up getting a front row seat for $85 with my MLife card (Im sure they were trying to fill up the front, since I had just tried to buy a seat with a worse view for $10 more). I was a single, so if it was discounted, that was why. I was cringe-worthy close but the lady at the ticket booth assured my that I was safe in the middle... probably. Either way, I couldnt make eye contact.

As with all Cirque shows Ive seen in Vegas, these guys are trully amaing athletes &amp; its a show worth attending."
Zumanity,"Beware this show will make you horny which while on a first date may OR may not be such a good thing.   The show room is both intimate and comfortable.  The performers sexy and athletic.  They hang out in the front of the theater striking a myriad of sensual poses before the show starts which was a tad surreal.  You feel as if you know them before the show starts.  I would have no problems seeing Zumanity again and possibly again after that.  Now that the first date is now my GF, I am sure the curtain call would be very different this time around......wink, wink."
Zumanity,"Not my favorite Cirque (which is O by the way).

Things I liked: talent of dancers/actors, favorite scene is the water scene because it was well choreographed.  The jokes were pretty funny.  

Things I didnt like as much: comedy scenes were interjected throughout, seemed like embarrassing the audience participants was supposed to be entertaining, a lot of acrobatics and contortionist, randomly strung together acts (not much connection or story)"
Zumanity,"Maybe it was an off night, but it seemed Cirque, short-cirqueted the storyline since partial nudity and glitz were more important than a well-thought out story.  I have such high expectations of cirque productions, I was sadly disappointed.  The performers were great, but the storyline itself was so boring I dozed off twice.  Guess I am just not that enthralled with nudity.. Definitely a meh in my opinion."
Zumanity,"This has the Las Vegas vibe all over it. We loved this show. Beware if you sit on the sofas or in the aisles be prepared to be part of the show and they do make it a bit scandalous. If you dont want to participate just let the ushers know in advance or get ready. Frankly we were glad to be sitting in the middle of a crowded section. Anyways, the talent here is amazing. It is a true cirque du soleil experience. People crying over show be geared toward an LGBT crowd is a bit overly dramatic. There is a drag queen hosting and one scene where two guys are dancing in a cage with heels. If that is too much for you then move to Alaska. It is the most risqué Cirque show Ive seen but that said if youre a total prude you will probably be bothered. If youre somewhat more open minded you likely will not get phased by this show. If youre offended by this show, frankly you shouldnt be in Vegas in the first place."
Zumanity,"Loved the show. The wife and I found it fun entertaining and quit hilarious. This is one of those shows that are fun to watch regardless of the seats you purchase. Beware the front row, they will pull you into the show."
Zumanity,"I really didnt know what to expect from Zumanity but after seeing Believe on our last trip, anything would be a few steps up. We got a great deal on tickets so we decided to give it a try. 

Will call was a breeze. The attendants were all quick, friendly, and efficient. Im not sure why other customer service people cant be just like this. Really. 

We walked in after dropping our leftovers from dinner at our room. No food allowed FYI. A few of the players were roaming the halls interacting with people. Most half naked. Even the ushers were wearing clothes that had airbrushed nakedness on their skirt/shirt/etc. Funny. 

We walked in the theater and I could tell that there was no such thing as a bad seat. it was a very intimate seating arrangement and the highest seats were still pretty darn close. Everything was decorated like a lush bedroom scene. Velvet, drapes, soft lighting everywhere. Good support for the theme I suppose. 

Pregame show was funny. A couple of hefty ladies and a married couple were walking around messing with the guests. Pretty hilarious. Like others are saying, if youre shy or even a bit prudish, stay away, especially from the front seating area. They are rubbing and swinging things at you that you might not find appealing, but its pretty damn funny from where I was sitting. lol. 

The acrobatic type acts were all very impressive. Very artistic and some very disturbing. I got a bit sleepy during a couple of acts but that was probably due to the glass of wine I had earlier. The humor was the key to this program though. The comic relief was great. The main person was pretty funny as well as the wife lady in pink. 

Again, if youre shy or are insecure, dont sit up front. They will do stuff with your significant others or make them do stuff with others in the audience that will make a very insecure person...well, insecure. Dont know if it turns to jealousy or rage, but hopefully they have a good sense of humor. That one guy didnt seem too happy though. lol. 

A good show for adults only. Lots of breasts and fake dingalings flying around. Its all in good fun so go in there with an open mind and an empty bladder (no intermission)"
Zumanity,"Oh man! I loved this show! It was my first experience at a Cirque Du Soleil show. (thank you to my yelper helper, you know who you are!) I know this show is all about sexuality and sensuality but I really didnt know what to expect.

I walked into the theater and ohmy! The actors/actresses were there to greet. The one on hooves scares me though.

I was going to get a drink to get a little buzz going on but... that long was too long! If you want a drink, go beforehand at another bar.  I would definitely wait till after the show for another cup of buzz. 

The theater itself was nice. Nice plush seating that went in a U shape around the stage. Luckily, I got front seat! UNluckily, I wasnt chosen to be a participant in the show!

The thing that I really liked about this show is that it included: sexiness, comedy, and acrobatics! I loved it. You must go see it for yourself. It may be inappropriate at times, but hey... this is Vegas. Deal with it.

PS.... all the actresses/actors are gorgeous! *le sigh*"
Zumanity,"LOVE IT!!!!  Ive seen almost all of the Cirque Du Soleils, and this one is one of my top (along with Ka).  Granted, its very different than any of the other CDS, but totally worth it.  This was my 2nd time seeing this one, and I was still just as amused as my first time seeing it.  There are no parts I disliked, or wasnt a fan of.  They definitely made it all very entertaining and fun.  I guess my only complaint is that I wish they used the main character in more scenes.
BTW, new york new york often runs specials for this show.  Be sure to check out their website!"
Zumanity,"Lots of fun, sexy and daring. Lots of audience interaction if you sit in the first few rows. Dont be shy, just relax and enjoy! We came on an off night and they moved us to the front row!"
Zumanity,"Dirty. Raunchy. and Boobies. 

Located in NYNY, I begged the boyfriend to taxi it there cause it was hot outside and I was laaaaaazy. heheh. So yes, we taxied it to the end of the strip and waited in a loooong line. Surprising because it was a line for people already with tickets. I dont know why it took so long. ;( poo. We came in and took pictures. The ladies who took our pictures were creative and the sweetest dears ever. Came into the show a little late but I dont think we missed much. Bf was pleased that there was more boobie action as opposed to the other option. I mean I give it credit for being creative and nice use of all the boobies theyve got running around on that stage, but Ive seen my fair share of cirque shows but this one wasnt my favorite. Audience interaction was lacking and some of the jokes were a little dry. And to be honest, after being in the sun all day and etc I fell asleep during some parts. I had to pinch myself to stay awake and drink my soda constantly."
Zumanity,"Had a rare date night with the hubby for this one..what a super sexy show! We had such a great time. When you walk in your greeted by some super sexy performers, grab a drink at the bar..they are yummy!
Sit down and prepare for a very interesting show.
Lots of wonderful entertainers..the ones in the fish bowl were super sexy for sure!
A must see for anyone who enjoys a more adult type show."
Zumanity,"Zumanity is Zexy.

Once again, another Cirque show that never fails. But who can fail when theres naked people being all sexy running around on stage for 90 minutes?

There wasnt money in the budget on this Vegas trip to see O, so we decided on Zumanity since they were having a summer promotion. We got center seats in the last row on the floor for $125/pair. The seats were great, but when some of the acts got high up in the air, the balcony was blocking our view. 

The show has a lot of audience participation so if youre sitting in the first few rows, you may be called up on stage and do things which you might regret later that night.

The only thing that irked me was getting into the show. We had just come from dinner at Wolfgang at MGM and had leftovers. When we got to the front door, the usher said we couldnt bring in outside food. Now I wasnt about to toss expensive food in the trash so I wanted to speak to the manager. Well she gave me the same bullshit so I decided to get creative.

Having just purchased a program from the gift shop from a Filipino, I asked her if I could keep the food behind the register. She kindly refused, but gave me a bigger NYNY bag and told me to put the food in there and enter the theatre in a different line. The plan worked perfectly so if you have dinner prior to the show and your hotel is far away from NYNY, make sure you do this."
Zumanity,"My experience with Cirque du Soleil shows is limited  as Ive only been to this one and Mystere, but this is a really good show!

From beginning to end, this show was funny, raunchy - and basically just plain fun. There is nudity and obviously there is sexuality depicted in the show, so if this is not your thing, this is not the show for you.

If you sit in the front, you definitely run the risk that the performers will make you a part of the entertainment, but everyone is fair game. 

Discount tickets are definitely available at the many discount ticket vendors on the strip, so definitely take advantage of this option if you can. We sat in the balcony, and could see pretty well (some guy kept leaning forward and so I had to keep adjusting), but Im sure that sitting on the main floor would have been better."
Zumanity,"Completely different from other Cirque shows.  For me, it was just okay.  After seeing what I think are their best Vegas shows (Ka and O), this was a bit of a letdown.  

They advertise this as a sensual show, but I found it to be more of an excuse to strip and crack jokes.  Im no prude....but I failed to see the artistic sensuality that they were going for.  Maybe its just not my cup of tea. 

When I go to a Cirque show, I want to be blown away by the acrobatics.  There were a few pieces that were really great in terms of acrobatics, but just not enough for me to give it any more than 3 stars."
Zumanity,Very sexy and entertaining show! The audience stays engaged the entire show and some audience members were brought on stage to interact with the cast. I went with my husband and another couple.
Zumanity,"Very different from the other Cirque du Soleil performances in vegas, if you present your Mlife card you can get a good discount on your tickets. We managed to score some really good balcony seats and the view from our seats was fantastic. This show is in a theater and not a large auditorium like the O or mystere, so seats are limited. There no real WOW factor about this show, maybe because the acrobatics is not as grandiose as the O or mystere, but it more than makes up for it in comedy and other R rated acts. I really enjoyed the music and the show, and left with a really warm feeling. The show does make you feel good :) and perfect to watch before a romantic dinner."
Zumanity,"Acrobatic, sexy and funny: The show is exactly what they advertize on their flyers and posters.

And because we sat near the front of the stage, I even got included into the cabaret part of this show, which was fun and only a little bit awkward :)."
Zumanity,"Ive seen most of the Cirque shows and I particularly enjoyed this one which is the reason for my post.  Its slightly different from the others in terms of the skill levels needed to do particular acts, an extremely different from the others in terms of the amount of clothes (some naked) worn by the performers.  Performers engaged the audience (as the do in other shows) which was great, the show was extremely sexual in nature (cant complain there), and the overall vibe from the crowd was outstanding. If your into Cirque shows in general you must see this!  My wife and I had a great time.  Again, its sexual so you have to be ok with that premise or you probably wont be into the show overall."
Zumanity,"On a recent spur-of-the-moment trip to LV with the hubs - we decided to check out the sensual side of Cirque.  We were not disappointed!

It was a fun romp of a show - hot chick with dozens of hula hoops spinning in the air, comic (albeit raunchy) relief in between performances, intimate setting (velvet curtains and all), bare boobies flying about...my fave was the topless girls in the giant fish bowl - hmm...theyre bendy O_O

The couple next to us was way too serious - besides having a box of Mike n Ikes and popcorn between them, they left about 10 mins into the show, with a well-I-NEver! huff.  Maybe they got free tix and didnt know what to expect.  Oh well, more elbow room for us!

Fun and naughty show!"
Zumanity,"I started to give 3/3.5 stars, but as I write the review and laugh about some of the funny things that happened, I have to go 4 stars.  I love that Janice C. refers to this show as ZumanTities, because I would have to agree.  In most Cirque shows, the costumes are elaborate and entertaining, but this show is almost completely void of costumes...unless you count the zipper pants that the Fabio look-a-like took off one section at a time.

The front row love seats (booths for 2) provide an extreme up-close-and-personal view of the entire show (for better or for worse).  The only part that I wished I was sitting up higher for was the rotating orgy bed portion.  I think it would have been better to see everything happening at once rather than one scene rotating by our faces at a time.

If you want to be included in the show, these are definitely THE seats to sit in.  Everytime they came close to us, my girlfriend clenched my hand, stared at the floor, and made it very obvious that she did not want to be included.  That actually saved me twice.  Once, I would have ended up holding boob baggies (hilarious bit) and the other time I would have been sans shirt on the orgy bed.  Thanks, honey.  The guy and girl who were called up for the orgy bed scene actually ended up being mother and son.  That made it even funnier.

During our show, there was a couple in the audience that had been married for 59 years.  They were from Australia.  The host brought them up on stage and asked them some questions.  One question, directed at the husband was whether or not he participated in a threesome back in the day.  His answer was, Yes, we had quite a few threesomes back in Australia.  When the host turned to his wife and asked if she was there, she responded with Oh yes!  Everybody was cracking up.  They must have been in their 70s or 80s.

Not your typical Cirque show, but definitely worth a try unless you are uber conservative, boring, up tight, or uncomfortable in your own skin.  Being with the wrong person might also impact your good time.  Have a few drinks to loosen up before you walk in, and be sure to get your seats early.  The pre-show is one of the funniest parts."
Zumanity,"Love the interaction with the audience.  If you plan on sitting close to the front (even in the middle of an aisle), dont be surprised if you involuntarily participate.  This is definitely different from other Cirque performances, but nevertheless just as fun and entertaining.  

BTW, dont forget to check out the peep holes in the hall."
Zumanity,"Havent had time to review until now but this show is awesome.... my favorite act was TWO GIRLS AND A CUP.... totally changed that tagged line for me,  lol.... like many yelpers said before this show has everything so youre allergic to any kind sexual acts is not for you.... It was fun and funny throughout and the audience participation added to the fun.... I had the front row balcony seats but definitely gonna try to get the front row Love seats next time.... I for one want to be picked to participate on stage,  best way to enjoy the show is to be part of it I say.... all in all I loved it and recommend it....."
Zumanity,Sex and Cirque!  What a great idea right! Well the show is very solid. I dont really like stage setup though or the facility that New York New York holds it in. For it be such a small venue the seats feel far back. The performance were good but not amazing like the ones I have seen in other shows. The Hula hoop girl is pretty good though.
Zumanity,"LOVED:

1. The host :) 
2. The intimate theatre (NO bad seats!)
3. Beautiful bodies of the performers, especially the martini glass contortionists. 

DIDNT LOVE: 

1. The male contortionist act was a little off-putting for me. Still an incredible feat, but I just dont think they pulled that off as sexy. Not for me, anyway! 

Still, I cant subtract a star. I loved this show, raunchiness and all!!"
Zumanity,"I wasnt expecting much from this show - for many reasons... 

Shows (like cards) bore me to tears and Im happiest behind a big slot machine! I go to Vegas to gamble - all I do when Im there is gamble. And eat occasionally. And drink constantly. 

I hosted a bachelor/bachelorette party and we decided to see a show as a group. Again, I wasnt expecting much and already had a get-away plan ready just in case I decided to fake sick - just to go throw my money away in a big slot machine!

Wrong! This show was amazing, kept us all laughing the whole time. I loved the sexiness, the sinfulness and the sheer playfulness.

I will definitely see this again in a few years as Im sure the show wont change much front month to month."
Zumanity,"This show was fantastic and fun! I am surprised that people got so offended seeing boobs.  Sorry but get over it.  Was this a classic cirque show..NO!  Was it filled with fantastic acrobats, contortionists, aerialists that were amazing performers and beautiful to watch...YES!

I went to Zummanity not knowing what to expect other then an adult theme, which it had.  I loved the clowns in the beginning and the people pulled on stage were hilarious.  I am not a prude by any means, but I didnt think the show crossed the line at all.

The acts were sexually themed, but who cares.  I wasnt watching naked people on stage have sex.  I was watching very talented people perform.  The two girls in the fishbowl were incredible contortionists.  So graceful and beautiful.

Overall I highly recommend this show, I liked it better then some of the others on the strip.  If your prudish then stay away.  Makes for a great date night."
Zumanity,"This show had me laughing the entire time. I came here on my Anniversary and I thought the show hit all the right points. They really interact with the audience and thats the best part. I agree with some others about the aerial stunts and things like that do kind of lack, but I think thats the sacrifice they make to bring the audience into the show. I went with an open mind and had a blast. If you are a conservative person then this show will probably test your comfort zone, but in all reality just go and have an open mind and be willing to experience all that is Zumanity. You wont regret it."
Zumanity,"Im surprised that they can keep the level of energy up in the show while doing it twice a day, every day. This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show and I was really impressed with the stunts, set design, and costumes. We planned on seeing this before coming to town but were able to buy tickets at a Tix4Tonight stand on the strip earlier in the day (huge savings, btw). Our seats were on the main floor toward the back corner, but we were able to move once the show started since the theater was only about 90% full.

Dont bring your kids to this one."
Zumanity,"One of my least favorite Cirque shows. Saw this in 2009 and at the time being the first Cirque show I had seen, I was impressed. Now, having seen 4 Cirque shows since then, its whatever. Unless you want to see (little) boobies, I would say your money is better spent on one of the other shows on the strip, such as Love or Mystere (havent seen O and I though KA was rather boring)."
Zumanity,"When my friends and I were talking about seeing a Cirque show, one of my friends mentioned that she wanted to see this because it was a very adult themed show. I thought I wouldnt have fun, but I actually enjoyed it. 

Its by no means O, but it was still pretty good. I think because Ive seen the best that Im always going to use it as a benchmark to compare any Cirque shows I will see. This show does have acrobatics and such, but in the same magnitude as O. 

The audience engagement is quite amusing! An old lady was brought to the stage for the orgy scene and she was enjoying herself a little too much! She was really getting into it with one of the performers, the madame hostess had to put her on the spotlight but she kept on and on! Another fave was the 2 swimming ladies in the huge fishbowl sort of thing. That was insanely good. Another one of my faves was the guy who would occasionally fly in with this huge cloth like wings thats probably 30 feet across. Random, but amusing. 

Female performers are almost always baring their breasts, male performers are dressed almost like Chippendales guys. So dont go if youre easily offended by this. 

Paid around $80 (including our student discount, which you should take advantage of if youre a student, as one valid student I.D. is good for 2 people) and had nice seats. Great deal."
Zumanity,"Ive been to 6 shows in vegas and this is near my least favorite.  Its not totally bad, but compared to O and KA, Zumanity just couldnt compare.  I want to give a 2 but its closer to a 3.   Its not as expensive as the other shows, so it might be a good show for somebody who hasnt watched a CDS show yet."
Zumanity,"having been to most cirque shows in Las Vegas this was the one left.  We were booked first row middle of the balcony.  When we arrived we were told they closed the balcony for our show and had been upgraded  we were moved to the 5th row on the side.  While it was ok I certainly did not see it as an upgrade.  The show is designed to be seen from in front of the stage.  I dont think I would consider this show erotic.  Some topless women with average bodies and some men in thongs.  Most Cirque shows leave me with about 15 minutes of unreal act that amaze me.  This show had none of that.  If you can go to LOVE, O, KA or Zarkana....do it.  This would be my very last choice....not aweful...but certainly not good."
Zumanity,"Prepare to arouse your senses.

Ladies, do you like sexy fauns (thats a half-man, half-beast with horns and legs of a goat, if you didnt know) with ripped abs growling and darting across the stage?  Apparently I do!! 

This was my first Cirque du Soleil show, so I cant compare it to any others, but I was thoroughly entertained by Zumanity!  If you are by any slight means conservative or are embarrassed easily by sex, this probably isnt the right show.  But... I am neither of those. 

The characters that interacted with the audience were funny and the acrobatic stunts were amazing - I couldnt keep my eyes off the stage.  Definitely a 5-star night of entertainment."
Zumanity,"This is a cool show, theres no doubt about that... Just a little different from what i was expecting.

What makes this show fun is its all about sexuality. A lot of pervertedness, language, nudity- all that fun Vegas stuff. There is a lot of audience participation, Id say at least 1/3 of the show is devoted to it. The costumes are fun and all of the naked people have amazing bodies(no vagina or penis- just a lot of muscles and boobs)

Unfortunately what I didnt like about this show was i felt there was a lot of repetitiveness. People swinging from wires, a girl comes out naked, people swing from wires, audience participation. A man comes out naked, people swing from wires, audience participation. People swing from wires, audience participation, a man does contortion, everyone gets naked. It really leaves a lot to be desired. 

It was fun and I did enjoy myself, but I wouldnt have known it was a Cirque show unless you had told me. When I think Cirque, I think Big Sets, Special Effects, Amazing Feats! Zumanity lacks the big set and special effects, and their most amazing feats are the people swinging from the wires- which is pretty much par for the course at any  show... 

I did have a good time watching this show, but for the price I paid I would have liked to see another Cirque show instead. If youre into sex shows- then this is the one for you! If youre into Cirque shows- id pass on this one."
Zumanity,"Thats an unique show for sure. The talent of Cirque du Soleil acrobats in a sensual mood. Nothing that you can really find elsewhere. Overall, the show was unique and quite entertaining, with a lot of interactions with the crowd. Keep in mind its 18+, so what youll see and hear can be a little uncomfortable if you are a little stuck up :)"
Zumanity,"3.5 stars

Zumanity was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I went in with an open mind and high expectations.  From all the hype and previews of other shows, Im fairly certain I would have been less happy with Zumanity had I seen another Cirque show before.

The acrobatics/contortions/basically what youd expect from CdS were impressive, but didnt necessarily have that wow factor.  Ive gone to see Bite, which had the same swing-from-a-rope acrobat thing, and was more impressed with the Bite acrobats (though it is important to note that is where the similarities between Bite and Cirque du Soleil end...).  I kept waiting to flip out and go OMG HOW DID THEY DO THAT but all that ran through my head was that was cool.

There were bits of [naughty adult] humor interspersed, but even though it fit with the general theme (sex) of the show, I didnt think it meshed well.  The skits were all boobie humor (hilarious), while the show had a much more serious feel.  

Also, there is one segment of the show where I was uncomfortable because I thought the acrobat was simulating committing suicide.  Evidently, it was erotic asphyxiation, and it culminated in her orgasm, not death (as I had thought).  So just a heads up...

I think Zumanity is best for those who have seen the WOW moments in other CdS shows, but leave your more conservative sensibilities at home...."
Zumanity,"Me and my girl friend watched the show on July 14 and it indeed meets our expectation. She was bugging me to take her to see a stripe show, so, we decided on Zumanity.  It was pretty entertain which included adult jokes (keke), acrobatics (so are all other Cirque shows) and alot of topless scenes  (thats it? :( .   The audience involvement was hilarious and sexy.  You can see the random selected audiences were not paid to be a part of the stage which there are alot of shows does.  Too bad I wasnt picked.. LOL.. Its not cheap, (so are all other popular Vegas shows)  but it does worth the money if you watch it one time."

Zumanity,"Hahahahahahahahaha. Looking for a good time? Finding yourself in New York, New York? Spend the money. Bring your honey. You might find yourselves on stage. And, if you dont, you get to watch someone elses awkwardness on stage. Its a good time."
Zumanity,"This show was really funny! 

The 2 girl act in a big glass was interesting, but I really like Edie, the MC, the two big sisters, and the funny couple with the french husband. It was just an entertaining show. 

The crowd interaction was awesome. A few people were brought on stage to participate and it was hilarious. One older lady was brought up and she was visiting from Maine, and her whole family was sitting in the audience - but she didnt care what she was doing!! That was funny!

I wish there was more male things going on, besides the constant titties - I didnt mind it, but make it equal - some for guys, some for girls. The hoola hoop act was really good. Its hard to keep all of those hoola hoops spinning while you are spinning yourself and flying through the air! Give her props!

It was a fun, couples type show to go to in Vegas. I took my in-laws to O, dont take them to this one!"
Zumanity,"Sexy, hilarious, and totally amazing.  Dont go if you are going to be offended by alternative sexualities.  Also, this would probably be a lot more fun if you went with someone you could play with afterward.  I went with my mom (who is very cool and loved it), but it just wasnt the same.

EDIT 4/06:  I just got back from Vegas where I saw Zumanity for the second time.  It was still amazing (can I take the contortionist home?), and several of the acts were different than when I saw it previously.  Also, I can now say first hand that it IS more fun if you go with someone you can play with afterward."
Zumanity,Zumanity was soooo much fun!   Great acts and great humor!   The caste had me laughing the entire time!  This is not your typical cirque show but a must see for cirque fans!!!
Zumanity,"This show and Pre-Show were amazing.  So Sexy and entertaining.  Do your self a favor and sit as close to the stage as possible.  You wont regret it.

5 Stars for another amazing show by Cirque du Soleil"
Zumanity,"The bf &amp; I saw Cirques Zumanity (in the New York New York Hotel) last year, but our recent Vegas visit reminded me to write a review for it.

The Sexy:
The hot mens in the cage
The fish bowl act
The hoola hoop girl (yowza)
The African Princess girl

The Campy:
The Scotch baggie lady
The drag queen host/hostess
The twins running around &amp; feeding men strawberries at the beginning of the show

The show is (obviously) x-rated &amp; for mature audiences only, but the sexy &amp; hotness factor is unfortunately overshadowed by the corny/campy parts-those I could have done without. Fun, intense show with some audience participation-if you dont want to be picked on, dont sit in the front."
Zumanity,"The performance of Zummanity Show left me feeling a little sensual....perfect to take your romantic partner.

Very sexy and riveting!"
Zumanity,"My second time watching this show, and honestly, wasnt as impressed as I was the first time.  I noticed some unfavorable changes to the show.  I dont know if its just cause its my second time watching it and nothing beats your first time, but I wasnt as psyched as I was the first time.

First off, they got rid of all the good food n snacks!! What happened to my beloved truffle oil popcorn? :( .  All the sandwiches, dips, etc are gone, all thats left are drinks, regular popcorn and candy.. like a movie theater w/booze.  Sad!

Secondly, if I can recall my last experience, some of the acts have changed.. some of the good ones were cut short.. some werent there at all, other acts, that I wasnt particularly a fan of were longer and overall, the acts seem more towards sex than cirques acrobatic acts.
It didnt really feel like a Cirque du Soleil show anymore, because their acts didnt have as much acrobatic artistry... just more sex... =/ 

For example, theres a scene where two ppl are doing acrobatic moves around a large bowl of water and they dive/jump in n out of it.. i couldve sworn last year it was a guy and a girl doing it.... and the moves were more impressive.. this time around it was two topless women trying to make out w/each other more than doing any impressive moves... 

Dont get me wrong, still a good show, but not as good as my first time .."
Zumanity,"Just when you think youve seen the hottest person in this show, someone even hotter appears. Made me wish I was a 25 year old acrobat!!!

As others have said, yes this show is sexy, and yes it explores every nook and cranny -- but it does it with humor 99 percent of the time, which makes it accessible to practically everyone. Remember its a circus, and ultimately each act centers around that type of action. Some acts are more artful in their combining of circus feats and the sexual theme, and others have more of a distinct separation between the two. Nevertheless even when you are mostly watching the acrobatic art, the beauty and high production values of cirque du soleil are always there. Wonderful MC as well. I have only seen one or two Cirque du Soleil shows and have found they usually dont feature much speaking, so that was also fun.

The costumes are over the top sensational, not in a Beachblanket Babylon way but in an artful fetishy way. Just lovely.

Warning: I bought the CD at the gift shop after the show, thinking it was the actual music from the show - the salesperson specifically said as much. On the jacket it says , Inspired by Zumanity and thats really what it is. Its not the actual music from the show."
Zumanity,A great different spin on Cirque. They interact and make you feel awestruck! Worth the intimate date experience!
Zumanity,Fun and sensual! Definitely for the open minded. Great for couples!
Zumanity,"This was my second Cirque Du Soleil show and I will keep going to them.  I am always so amazed by the set, lighting, acrobatics, costumes, etc.  The last one I went to was Cirque Du Soleil- La Reve which was amazing- very serious and romantic tho. 

This show was def not that. 

I was intrigued by the whole sensual aspect of it.  I def believe.  One set that completely stood out to me was when these two topless women in g-strings that were in a see through bathtub.  They were wooshing and sliding and being all bendy.  Super hot. 

Their was a lot of comedic intermission as well with forced audience participation. haha.  It was pure comedy when they pulled people from the audience to do lewd acts. I loved it!  

I wont elaborate anymore to spoil the show for any of you reading this but I say go watch it.  Its very entertaining and completely different from the other shows.  

Also check on the NYNY website first before buying in other places.  I happened to get a promo code that made it 70 bucks each which I thought was a major steal!  I had mid level seats.. right behind orchestra but not balcony level.  Its intimate in the theater- I cant imagine there being a bad seat."
Zumanity,"I have seen just about all of the Cirq shows, and I really think this is my favorite, even tops O in my books.  It is just so much fun and entertaining... the kind of fun you WANT to have in Vegas... no dark story line, no drama... just some nice, classy, but at the same time raunchy humor.  This was our second time seeing the show, sitting in different seats, and I dont know how, but my husband was picked to be the meat of the Twin Sandwich both times!  After you see this show,  you will understand what this means!  If you are a prude, dont bother going... go be boring at KA!"
Zumanity,"Oh my seXXiness!

Okay so heres the deal---I loved this show.  Yeah so did a lot of people, but, here is why and Ill give you some other info as well, read on...

I picked this show, my choice because I wanted to see what a sensual Cirque de Soleil show was all about---I was amazed nonetheless!  This show has provacative funny written all over it!  You will laugh and e so amazed and leave with a smile and will want to go home and play!

You can go casual, people came in tennis shoes, and its inside New York New York on the first floor--theres no outside food allowd but they do sell drinks and snacks inside so we got a diet coke and popcorn.  

Overall I loved this show because there was a lot of talent and humor involved!  the best seats are up front, but not the couples love seat because thats just too close!  We sat 3rd row up from the front and had the best seats, so splurge a little and get the good seats!"
Zumanity,"I sometimes think I am a jaded San Franciscan and have seen it all.   
I was enthralled  with this sexy, racy part acrobatic, part strip tease, part burlesque Show 

I wanted to do a show while in Las Vegas. I wanted something that captures the essence of the City.  My blood was definitely pumping afterward.

I have never been to a Cirque show although I know a fair amount about the Canadian roots."
Zumanity,"Excellent show, very funny and sexual!!! Keep an open mind and if your seats are in front be ready to participate in the festivities. Overall, nothing degrading all fun, all good."
Zumanity,"Eh, pass.

Even the boobage wasnt enough to save this Cirque show from being a complete bore."
Zumanity,"Indeed, this is definitely a different side of Cirque du Soleil.  Im not so sure its a good one though.  I expected to leave the showing feeling sensual, hot, and ready to pounce on my boyfriend when I got home.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.

This show relies heavily on audience participation.  If you bought one of the more expensive seats in the front, be prepared to have the spotlight shown on you.  Yes, theres a small sign before you enter the theater warning you that you may be asked to participate and you can always decline, but when you have everyone clapping and cheering you on, you dont want to be the dud that says no.

The show bounces quickly from a hot and heavy sequence that can leave you breathing a bit deeper, but before you can even enjoy this feeling for a bit longer, it jumps quickly to their version of commercials.  Yes, their sideshows are humorous and make up a huge portion of the show.  But youd think the way Zumanity was advertised, this would play a secondary role in this show.  It dominated it ours.

There are some talented individuals in this performance, and some interesting and costumes (or lack of).  The stage is pretty small compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows though.  

I sat in section 203, which was a pretty good section.  It wasnt too close for the expensive costs, but close enough for you not to notice the difference.  And it wasnt so far back or up high that you felt like you were in the cheap seats.

Overall, it was okay for a Cirque du Soleil show.  Maybe I just expected more and was disappointed.

Rankings thus far:
1) Cirque du Soleils O
2) Cirque du Soleils Ka
3) Cirque du Soleils Mystere
4) Cirque du Soleils Zumanity
5) Dragones Le Reve"
Zumanity,"Do it!!!  If you have an open mind and love being a little naughty, then this is the show for you!  Amazing talent, exhilarating performances, and enough sexual humor to make anyone blush with giddiness.  I loved that show covered just about every area of sexaulity, from the more vanilla to the kinky 50 shades of gray variety, and I applaud Cirque du Soleil for their wonderful celebration both straight and gay sexual exploration.  Thank you Cirque du Soleil for a magnificent work of human art and a sinfully extravagant evening!"
Zumanity,"Thorougly enjoyed Zumanity. Awesome, funny, very entertaining and interactive. Love the interaction as long as its not me their picking on hahaha. I was nervous they would since my bf and i were sitting in the 2nd row but luckily they didnt cuz the things that they make you do up on the stage is ........ i would turn red like an apple. LOL.

Definitely a different type of Cirque show. 360 turn from the elegant O show.  I dont think you will regret it as long as your not so uptight or easily offended. This may have been comped, but if i  paid for it, i would not come out dissapointed, same goes for  O. Just dont watch KA whether you pay or its free."
Zumanity,"Zumanity tickled me in many many ways!....

Just the right amount of tickle for your pleasure, Zumanity is another brilliant, sexy &amp; hilarious creation of Cirque du Soleil.

I had a blast at this show and it held my attention in ways I didnt know it could be held.... *ahem* haha.

This is a perfect show for couples, group of girlfriends or the gay boys out on the town! 

You will bite your lip

You will laugh

You will cringe 

But you will leave with a smile on your face and a good time! If you are staying in NY NY hotel you cant pass this up. Either way, this show is worth the ticket price and will cure your entertainment needs!"
Zumanity,"Nothin compared to the O on water show I saw a few years ago. If I had known how disgusting and perverted it was  I wouldnt had gone. Orgys, threesomes, not sensual just gross."
Zumanity,"A bit strange to see 4 stars instead of 5 for a Cirque du Soleil show. However, this one falls just a bit short. Mainly because when I saw it I found some of the performers acts a bit weak. Now it has been a few years since Ive seen it so i may have improved and some acts may have changed or been altered. 

Now I know this is like a broken record from me, but to put my review in perspective I feel it necessary to say that I have seen all the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas, some multiple times, and most all of their road shows. All of them are well worth seeing. 

This show is more like an adult cabaret vent. Do not bring the kids. The theater is set up as such with some couch seats up front and a close balcony all around. Things are geared toward the bawdy sexy side so expect it or avoid it if its just not something you want to see. Some highlights for me where one the guy that seemed to be triple jointed everywhere and the two female performers in the large clear bowl of water. Sounds strange, but they were wonderfully sensual and entertaining. A definite pleasant change of pace from other shows. I applaud Cirque for attempting to do something else and for the most part succeeding. This show isnt for everyone, but if you a good bawdy show and laugh and a bit open minded sexually (not to say your oppressed if you dont like it ) you should enjoy yourself here.

As is my habit, here is a link  to a video. Actually for a change here are two:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_0XPFDQA4o

Go to their web site and make reservations early for the best seats."
Zumanity,"I would say that this is a cute show. I know its supposed to be naughty and risque. I found it more cute, despite the naked boobies. :) The performers did a really good job getting the audience in on the act, and those were actually my favorite parts. Some of the acts were slower than others. I am not really a fan of pure acrobatics. I know the performers are strong and very talented, but I just get a little bored.  But the costumes are gorgeous. I thought the drag queen emcee was really sweet and funny although Id prefer a little more channeling of Alan Cumming in Cabaret. :) Overall, it kept my attention. It wasnt as good as Love, but better than Absinthe."
Zumanity,"WOW! that pretty much could be all that needs to be said for this review, but that would be lame! 
Zumanity A+. I have seen this show once before and i was blown away then. This time even knowing what to expect, STILL blown away.
This show is for the dirty minded only! =) The show is done in good taste, not like a straight out strip show. The comedy in the pre-show and throughout is just the best."
Zumanity,"Low Expectations.

Other than Elvis at Aria, this was the last Cirque du Soleil show left that I had yet to see.  As the title states, I had very low expectations for this one, but Ive waited so long listening to the hype, or lack thereof, from other people whove attended that I thought it time for me to experience the adult flavor of Cirque du Soleil for myself.  Suffice it to say, I was extremely pleased with spending my hard earned cheddar on this show.

Overview - This whole production is very well done.  I really dont know where they find all of these talented people but it is an extremely impressive feat they have accomplished.  There is a little bit of everything in this show and I think thats what made me like it so much.  There is singing, dancing, acrobatics, sensuality, crowd interaction and participation and of course, most importantly, breasts.  Beautifully perky and flawless breasts.

Cast - These people are downright beautiful, talented with deft skills.  They would cater to everyones taste.  They have gorgeous women, good looking guys (for the ladies and the not so straight), and hilarious skits in between the acrobatics that will leave you laughing for days and days.  Seriously, the cast is insanely funny and thats what I was most surprised with about this show.  Its more side-splitting laughter than anything else and thats what stood out to me the most.

Venue - This theater is very nice in that its quaint.  Not quaint as in small but a good quaint.  Its a very intimate show and you dont feel lost in the show like you do with most productions in Vegas.  You actually feel like youre experiencing the show instead of watching from afar.  Highly recommended.  The chairs are comfortable and they even have sofas in the first row for couples that want to be close to the action and close to each other.

All in all this was an excellent show and couldnt be better."
Zumanity,"So Ive seen a lot of shows in Vegas and I have to admit this is one of the few I didnt see and I finally got to see it.  It is very fun and has a great staff that greet you when you walk in.  It is sexy, very sexy.  Made it very entertaining.  There isnt a fancy stage like KA or O but I guess the mere fact it deals with sex made it that much more fun.  Especially with the audience interaction.  

I watched,  Criss Angel Believe the night before and this was much more worth it and cheaper."
Zumanity,"This show is not your typical, stunningly beautiful, artsy Cirque show. People expecting to see what theyve seen from other Cirque shows will, surely, be disappointed. There are, indeed, plenty of acts within the show that are common to this circus, but theyre wrapped up in a cabaret, lead by an MC in drag.

I love Zumanity. The hula-hoop girl? Awesome. Two tiny, pretty contortionists swimming about in a small glass bowl? Way cool. And the dancer, the satyr guy, he was nuts! I cant wait to go again, and see what I missed."
Zumanity,"3.5 stars

If you are comfortable with sex and sexuality, this show is for you! Lets not forget all the gorgeous bodies that will be displayed on stage, be prepared to be jealisssss and hit the gym hoping to look like them.

As you are in your chair waiting for the show to start, you will hear soft moaning in the background, prepping your body for the experience. The preshow introduces you to some of the characters that you will see later on stage, its pretty funny.  If you sit in the front, there are chances you will get touched, slightly molested, or if youre lucky, head burried in between giant boobies, YAY BOOBIES!

The show itself was very sexual yet artistic. It did not get a higher rating from me (as much as I want to give it) b/c I think theres too much acrobatics.  The technicality level of the acts are not as high as other Cirque du Soleil shows Ive seen.  The humorous acts were no doubt FUNNY! which involves audience participation...but I want to see more amazing acts =I

Ladies, there is one male strip act so prepare yourself :)"
Zumanity,"On my quest to watch all of the Cirque shows in Vegas, I checked out Zumanity last week while I was there. Nothing spectacular with this one, sad to say. Perhaps if its your first Cirque show, youd be impressed, but having seen Ka and O, Zumanity wasnt as impressive in my opinion. It definitely is funny and witty but the stage is really small and isnt as versatile as it could be. We sat towards the back of the orchestra seats, right in the middle. But really, there are no bad seats in the house. They spend a lot of the show on crowd participation and comedic relief. At that point, I felt that they were just trying to kill time. Its a short show as is: 1 hr 30 min. I guess the only thing that makes this show stand out from the others is that its a topless show. If youre looking for an act with more acrobat and artistry, Id go for the other Cirque shows."
Zumanity,"This show is different from every other Cirque du Soleil show Ive ever seen.  Be prepared - this is an adult show with nudity and very adult themes.  There were a few uncomfortable moments with the performances, but on the whole, its still a very visually stunning show.  As always, the costumes are incredible.  The music is perfect.  The acts are all very inventive and the performers are amazing.  
Simple words of warning - Dont bring your parents or grandparents."
Zumanity,"I  saw this show couple of weeks ago and i was very entertained. Me and my boyfriend got free tickets so i was even more thriled:D
I knew the production wasnt going to be as big compared to the other Cirque shows that ive seen, but i dont think i got bored at any parts at all. 
I loved how the entertainers interacted with the audiences and how they had the two big ladies walking around making a fool of themselves before the show lol. They have different acts that rely on art, dance,acrobatics, sex, and comedy.

Almost every woman performing on stage was topless and if that makes you uncomfortable then this is probably not the show for you.  But I really enjoyed many parts of this show and it really taps into peoples sexual desires.
If you get a chance go see it!"
Zumanity,"While I enjoyed Zumanity, I cannot say that I liked it as well as the other Cirque shows I have seen.  The acts were good, but not the breathtaking feats that I like to see from this establishment.

The comic relief was very cute.  The little love seats they have for couples who buy prime tickets are nice.  I really enjoyed the ringmaster.  

This is a very sensual show."
Zumanity,"I looooved this show. It was worth every penny. Im probably not suppose to say this but throgh the summer they have by one ticket get the second for 25 dollars. All areas of seating.

My favorite acts were the fishbowl and the bondage lady. The fishbowl was so delicate and sexy. I think people of all seualities would love it. It was a lesbian act but it was so pretty that it doesnt matter.  

The bondage was sooo freakin sexy.  (Dont judge me).

The hosts were very funny and engaging. I love when people involve  the audience. The cast was so gorgeuous. 

Its a live band and live singers.  It was really intimate and well put toghether.

At the end they pull a guy and girl from the audience and put them onstage. Of course the man was super excited. But they pulled those most shy, timid, weak woman up onstge.  They should have pulled me up there. they would have asked for a job application when I was done."
Zumanity,"Okay.. after my boyfriend and I went back and forth for 2 hours deciding if we want to see Zumanity or Ka [I wanted Zumanity, he was feeling iffy about it], we finally decided [I got my way] to see Zumanity!! Yay!

It was my first Cirque show ever and I was like a little kid going to Disneyland. I heard that if you get there early, you can take photos outside the theatre with the performers. [Unfortunately, we overslept during our nap] so we missed that part. But when we arrived, there are photographers that take your photo [$44 a piece, but they usually give you a $5 coupon].
Anyways! The drinks at the bar are themed and very funny [Blue Balls, anyone?] The prices were normal Vegas prices and drinks were yummy.

Before the show even started, the performers walk around the theatre engaging with the audience, sitting on laps, feeding strawberries to guests, etc. Very entertaining! My favorite was the Southern blonde woman and her husband. Also, I loved the 2 chubby ladies! They were hysterical! 

The whole show was amazing, especially the girl who does the hula hooping and the two women in the glass swimming around. 

Only one scene had me kind of bored [Woman doing the bondage skit, moaning and groaning around]

Definitely recommend this show to anyone with an open mind because it is a little sexual, but mostly in a comedic way!  [For example, Antonio loses his pompom ball that was covering his parts and runs through the audience with his thing flapping all over the place!!!]"
Zumanity,"Absolutely LOOOVED this show. 

The first Cirque show I had ever watched was O, so watching Zumanity was such a different experience. 

The seating area is small and cozy, but still very spacious. I loved the cute little couch seating around. 

The vibe of the whole show was great. I just loved how there was a lot of audience interaction. 

I love the fact that the creators of the show were able to take sex and express it in very beautiful and classy ways that people wouldnt normally expect. This show puts a great spin on nude dancing and makes it enjoyable to everyone in the audience. 

Great show. 

Tip: Dont go to the show if youre up tight or not an open-minded person."
Zumanity,"Great show!! Worth every penny. The venue is pretty small so every seat can guarantee a great view but i recommend sitting in the front (if you are not afaird of being taken up on the stage) or the balcony. My bf and i sat in the first row in the balcony and you can see everything especially when some of the dancers are high up in the air. Zumanity is definitely different than Mystere (which has more acrobats), the show is more about dancing, sexual implications and metaphors. Great music, dancing &amp; interactions with the audience. 

My favorite part was when the hot dancer who was dancing on top of TV while the men were trying to watch football. She was hottttttt. Also, we cant forget the school girl! :D 

ps. Beware of topless dancers and almost...i mean almost a glimpse of a fully naked man."
Zumanity,"SEXY! SEXY! SEXY! 

I love Cirque.... but dont be fooled this is nothing like any Cirque show out there.. I really feel they just wanted the Cirque du Soleil name on the show, but hey it worked and is hot. 

I really enjoyed myself and highly recommend the show if your not a prude and know how to enjoy your sexual side.

They have a fantastic mix of drinks in the theater bar with excellent bartenders.. I highly suggest grabbing a drink before the show cause every classy person should have a martini on them at all times.

I cant wait to see it again."
Zumanity,"My hun, friends and I REALLY enjoyed this sexy, hilariously funny and erotic burlesque show. Its truly worth every cent spent to see the gorgeous bodies always provided by Cirque shows. Hubba, hubba! Good gosh were the men and women HOT! 

I cant even recount how MANY 6-packs I saw and I aint talking about beer either Yelpers! Oh my gosh were the bodies HOT! It is most def one of the best Cirque show ive seen and am definitely recommending it to everyone!"
Zumanity,"This was my 9th Cirque show. If you are looking for fit partially nude people and none of what you have come to expect as Cirques standards of entertainment, than go ahead and spend your money on this one. I am still kicking myself for choosing this over O and  the Chris Angel Believe show. Actually, I would have rather seen Mystere again over this. My husband and I almost left early which we NEVER do and we just kept looking at each other like REALLY??. Not in a prudish way at all - more like an I cant believe we spent our $ on this! way. Giant disappointment :("
Zumanity,"I absolutely loved this show. If you are looking for pure circus acts, this may not be your show.I wouldnt recommend this Cirque Du Soleil show if your are not open minded. There is T&amp;A EVERYWHERE and they pull random people out of the crowd for participation. No they arent planted, I was one of them (I was just to chicken to dry hump on stage) 

It was very entertaining and as you know. the whole show was very sexual. Everything from girl on girl acts to strip teases.It is definitely FUN for adults but NOT for kids."
Zumanity,"I LOVE ZUMANITY!  This show has some of my favorite cirque acts and characters.  I love the cabaret feel to the show, it makes it feel more intimate.  I have seen this show several times and I could see it again and again.  It is so amazing to see the human body at its best."
Zumanity,"OMG this show was super funny and made my cheeks hurt for two days from laughing so hard. I would not recommend this show to everyone you have to have the personality for it. If you can handle raw and wrong humor and can laugh at the 70s type swinger style stuff then you can handle this show. Go with a very open mind. 
If you have an open mind go see it:)"
Zumanity,"I saw the show 3 days ago with my bf. This was our first CDS show. 
Originally we wanted to see KA but they were sold out for the day we wanted to see so we opted for zumanity. 
All in all we both enjoyed it very much and thought all the acts were kinda cool. Very sensual and sexual and at times very funny..i think this is a good show to go see with your significant other but not with your parents or family members. It can get a lil uncomfortable at times.
My favorite part was the act with the water bowl and the guy in the metal rings. This show intrigued us enough to make us want to start seeing all the CDS shows. This was worth our money definately. We were actually walking to the ticket box office in the NyNY and we were handed a 2x1 coupon to the show, so this made it a lot more enjoyable.
The theater is small so all the seats are very good seats. I would see it again."
Zumanity,"Loved every moment of it! Wasnt even planning on a show but at the ticket discount venue we took advantage of their deal and Im so glad we did. Arrived as informed, early since the discounted tickets are first come first serve. Got into the theater to walk into their preshow where the performers were mingling with the guests. So much fun just during that. Once seated inside we were pleased with our seats for being discounted and last minute they were decent.  Off to the side on the upper level. Show was awesome never once was I left unentertained. So much to take in, sure its very adult &amp; risque, but its exciting and fun. Drinks are priced the same as all shows are, priced  very high but being tipsy does add to the experience! You leave feeling frisky &amp; sexy lol."
Zumanity,"Excellant!!! What a show... What a show!!! I loved the whole thing. This show had it all. Very sexual and lots of nudity. The hula hoop girl and the contortionists are pretty good. Fat ladies, topless women and men making out on stage... what more can you ask for? Its totally wild but the acts are so flawless you would be crazy not to see this show. It really was worth the price and all the seats are very close to the stage so you wont miss a thing.
WARNING: Leave your parents and kids at home for this one!!!"
Zumanity,"This show was AMAZING. Very glam and sexy. The stunts were phenomenal, they were extremely talented and kept my boyfriend and I entertained the whole time. They kept pulling people from their seats which is very cool!!!! Everything about this show was perfect. Im planing on seeing all Cirque du Soleil shows."
Zumanity,"Im booking this show again for my next stay in Vegas. It was THAT good. There was something for me and my husband to both enjoy. You cant go in there expecting a traditional Cirque show but there are certain things that do give it that Cirque signature if you have ever seen any of there shows.
I paid for the love couches and sat on the side of the stage. When I go again, I am going to go for front and center because the sides really arent that great of seats. 
All in all this is a 5+ stars!"
Zumanity,"2 stars for the bawdiness, 4 stars for the athletic acts, so it gets a 3 average. Way overblown.  This show does not come close to the others available in LV.  It is basically a bawdy burlesque show, with great athletes and their acts interspersed between the sex and gay jokes. 

It does have great performers.  The Russian lady on the lines swings with the Little Person and holds him only with her legs as they swing 40 feet above the audience. The two girls in the fishbowl  are more erotic than athletic. The strong man is really strong. The contortionist really contorts.  The orgy scene with audience participants must be like hedonistic Rome (tamed down, of course).

The MC is a drag queen, and that really turned me off.  So, I guess it has something for everyone, perhaps. 

I went once just to see what it was all about, I wont go again."
Zumanity,"Definitely not your standard Cirque du Soleil show though it still has some amazing stunts. The show is very sexual, so if your uncomfortable about that, this would not be the show for you. Also there is quite a bit of audience participation, but if your sitting in the balcony you wont get called on.

Great show still, id see it again."
Zumanity,"I really enjoyed my Zumanity experience. Yes, the show is raunchy (jokes mostly), but the athletes were genuinely spectacular to watch. I thought the nudity was pretty mild (no male full frontal) and nothing you wouldnt see on any European variety show. 
Basically Zumanity was going for a burlesque feel, a little raunchy, a little naughty, big costumes and characters and some sexiness thrown in. I was entertained the whole time, audience plants or not, and Id hope people go a see this cirque twist on an adult show."
Zumanity,"Make sure you get there early to see the pre-show antics.  The twins will keep you entertained, they also serve strawberries if your lucky enough to get their attention.
Also understand that you may become part of the show. If thats not your thing you probably want to be in the balcony.  Otherwise its a chance you take (we were spared!!).
Its all about Love and sex from first kiss down to orgie. But tastefully done.  Great show for couples!!  We went during our honeymoon.  Id so see it again."
Zumanity,"I had worked in the entertainment business in Vegas for many years  and seen every show in town , i only give this show a 2 stars since i found the least of my favorites shows from Cirque Du soleil,   I didnt find it sexy and or funny nether less entertaining , i didnt find sexy two guys kissing ....not my cup of of tea, i didnt find the 2 humongous girls yoking around  funny, the acrobatic part of the show was non existing , the only part that i found sexy unique and beautiful was an Asian woman bathing inside of giant  Martini glass that why i give this show a 2 star instead of one if you are in to stupid jokes drag-queens and so  on this is the place for you !!"
Zumanity,The actors were talented but it was pretty boring.  The MC was trying to be funny but was not cutting it.  Everyone was topless but you could not tell the difference between the men or the women.  It would have been more sexy if the women looked like woman with curves and boobs.  Absinth Show  @ Ceasers was way way more fun!!!!
Zumanity,"This show was alright. I didnt expect it to be like it was. I wouldnt really recommend this show unless I know that someone is very open about their sexuality &amp; open to straights, gays, drag queens, etc. I took my husband to this show in hopes that wed have a great experience knowing that it was a sexual show but it actually made him so uncomfortable that he got up &amp; asked me to leave with him because he did not want to watch it anymore. We only got halfway through the show. I was more open sexually &amp; didnt mind it too much but he did not like it at all. FYI, women in the show are 90% topless (not a problem for us), men in thongs (ok), men hitting each other with a whip &amp; making out (he was uncomfortable), men in high heels, 1 drag queen, grabbing people from the audience that are noticeably attending the show with their spouse &amp; having them get sexual on stage with a stranger from the audience that is also attending the show with them. Very open sexual show."
Zumanity,"The sensual offering of Cirque du Soleil show series! :) Yes indeed and esp the wine glass bowl act! Who is to complain when we got free tickets to the show. Being at the right place and the right time. 
Definitely a great show with a happy ending! :)"
Zumanity,"Before Believe dragged its douchy embarrassment into the Cirque world Zumanity was my least favorite. That said its not even close to that bad. 
Why? I looked at it from two perspectives. As a Cirque fan and looking at its unique content.
Thats the trouble... I normally dont care for Vegas risqué shows. Not opposed, just not interested. I only saw Zumanity because its a Cirque show. Im not naive, I knew what I was getting into. I didnt expect the same as all the other shows. 
From a pure Cirque perspective, its just ok. The artistry and acrobatics cant compete with its bigger, broader appealing siblings. Even Mystere. That said it still has proper Wow! moments.
Buuuuuuuuuut... Its more than that. It takes on sexuality, seduction, etc. from a Cirque angle.  Except for the humor, it does this tastefully. Its provocative, sexy, etc, but not cheap or vulgar. Plenty of eye candy for men and women. Plus its eye candy with impressive talents.
Buuuuuuuuuut... Its more (or less?!) than that. The humor is a big part of the show. Its crude, its vulgar, and its pretty funny. Its the only Cirque show that the characters call the clowns clowns. Oh yeah! They speak  English! No Cirque gibberish! Refreshing. :-)

The Good: Taste- The humor is crude. The show seduces, teases, and dazzles with its sexuality. Just like real love, beauty, &amp; lust.
The Bad: Sorry, but the Botero sisters are not sexy. They revel in innuendo and present like baboons, but they arent sexy. Am I prejudiced or close minded or something? Maybe, but I find the obese the opposite of sexy.
The Warning: If you arent a good sport or are easily offended, avoid the love seats!!! If you are cool with crude teasing and preferably attending with someone youre intimate with, go for it, but youve been warned..."
Zumanity,Fun! Fun Fun! Lots of talented performers. The comedy and side-routines were extremely entertaining. Laughing so hard that you have tears one moment then utterly amazed the next. Awesome show!
Zumanity,"Beware - Lots of boobies and abs! Haha. I had a good time watching this show. I really enjoyed the hoola hoop girl, the gymansts swimming in the bowl, and the little person doing the ribbons. The show was pretty entertaining, especially when the audience members were involved during the show. 

My hubby and I were late, and missed the pre-show and the first couple of acts, but we had a good time. Our seats were not bad, even though we sat towards the back of the auditorium."
Zumanity,"My wife and I saw the show last night. We have been to many other productions on the strip, but this was our first cirque du soleil show. I was expecting a large production, but was quite surprised to find that it was a smaller intimate setting. This was very welcoming, and made us feel connected with the cast. From the opening warm up through the last act, we were completely entertained. The cast was impeccable, brilliant, and beautiful. 

Simply put, you need to see this show. My wife and I want to thank everybody in the production for giving us a wonderful night. We will be back! 

Ps Antonio has very grabby hands, so watch out! :)"
Zumanity,An enjoyable show with fantastic acrobatics and adult-themed humor.
Zumanity,"If you are expecting a Cirque-type show this isnt the one for you. Ive been to a few Cirque shows and I felt completely jipped when this one was over. I didnt leave with the feeling of WOW! It was more Meh... 
We bought tickets to Mystere for the following night."
Zumanity,"I am not sexually repressed...Of course most people will say that.

However, most people go to Cirque to see stunts and staging, and you really see less of that in this show.  Yeah, I am all for a milk bath(provided I can shower afterward), but I can do that on my own.  I have a bath.

However, I probably will not jump into water from a ceiling, play with fire or run on a circular treadmill as it spins in an alternating rotation.

You can certainly see Zumanity, but after every other Cirque show


Then again, I could very well be repressed"
Zumanity,"This is a topless show.  Thought it would um put me in the mood but definitely was not up to my expectations. Not enough acrobatic like the usual cirque du soleil shows.  Some parts were funny but not hilarious.  The theater is actually really small.  Our sides were close to the stage but it was on the side and most of the time I couldnt really see what was going on since the performers faced the center of the stage.

Overrall just a lot of boobies.  Men were not that Hot.  I was not impressed and I really dont like Fabio looking guys with long hair. Ick!"
Zumanity,"I was totally not expecting to see a show when i came to Vegas. Heck i was just happy walking the strip and getting drinks at random bars at the hotels and people watching!  When my awesome guy said we are seeing Zumanity at 10:00pm on a Saturday night i was in shock then excitment built up inside of me. Really... Really we get to go see Zumanity??!!
Okay so im a complete dork about the smallest things in life, and this made me happy. 
We arrived there a little bit after the show started, but no worries we were able to get our tickets and hike up the windy yet beautiful staircase to our seats. The usher was friendly and welcomed us to the show, took a look at our tickets and we followed her to our seats. 
Our seats were in the upper orchestra section which were awesome, could see the whole stage. 
The show was enjoyable, sensuality and eroticism in all its forms and from all perspectives!! This is not a show for your parents, grandparents,anyone who blushes, or thinks this type of stuff is icky! For 90 minutes you are awestruck by the performers,costumes (well lack there of), acrobatics, dirty tongue in cheek jokes, and the unique music that makes Cirque du Soleil so darn cool!!"
Zumanity,"In a nutshell the entire show left me flat.  But see my footnote at the bottom which may explain why.

As far as Cirque shows go its a bargin basement Cirque - barely a Cirque show at all.  There were a few fancy costumes, hardly any fancy sets or props.  I found myself a lot of the time watching the girl dancers in the background with their fancy costumes, yawning at the main act out front.  It was basically a harmless titty show.

We had front row seats which showed promise at the beginning because we got to be part of the act as the two comedic hosts went around to front row people to tease and have fun with us.  

The performers were all very good looking and very much in good physical shape - and not tan! I loved that no one had a tan, fake or otherwise. 

There was one very scary dude - blond with a black cape.  He had this haughty, scary, ugly, sneer on his face every time I saw him that made me want to back up and run away.  And what is it that makes people think that heterosexual women love men in shorty shorts?  Nearly all the guys had short shorts on the whole time, which does not turn me on, I would never be attracked to a guy in shorts that short.  There was one hunky guy dressed in black leather motorcycle pants and he was the only one I could look and feel any sort of desire - until he sneaked a wink and wave at another guy on stage.  

I found out that in a performance on the day before we saw it, two performers had fallen on stage and were injured.  I suddenly felt a sense of sorrow and realized that this is the vibe I was getting from the show when we saw it.  It also helped me to put into perspective that most of the acts were relatively non-riskey, and everyone seemed to be holding back quite a bit.  I am sorry for the performers who were injured, and the others in the show who were affected emotionally, however I should have been offered a refund due to the fact that they did not replace the act that had to be taken out of the show, and that even though the show went on it was lacluster and not what it promised to be as far as Im concerned.

But even with that knowledge I still think I should have spent my money on any other Cirque show - or even on Le Reve."
Zumanity,The show is interesting - but I would not go back.  I have seen all but 2 of the cirque shows in Vegas so the acrobatics are all the same - you are just looking for a different side of comic relief.  The theatre is impressive- comfortable seats in the balcony areas.  I was told to sit up here unless you want to be dragged on to the stage with the ensemble- which was a great tip.
Zumanity,"Out of the six Cirque shows in Vegas, this is my favorite! Ive seen it 6 times. :)

http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/Zumanity/en/intro/intro.asp

Its all about s-e-x, traditional man &amp; woman, man on man, woman on woman, interracial romance, orgies, dildos/toys, she-male/drag queens, you name it, its in there.  If youre easily offended, go see O at the Bellagio.

I laughed my hiney off the majority of the time. 

It contains GREAT acts that still stick to the traditional Cirque theme.

Get there a little early, they say to pick up your tickets at least 1 hour prior to show time to get seated, go to the concession stand (which has funny names for the drinks), get situated, etc.  There are some actors that come out into the audience before the start of the show, you wont want to miss that.  But they do hold your tickets for you up until the start of the show time.

There really isnt a bad seat in the house unless youre sitting on the far corners closest to the stage in sections 101 or 104, theyre close, but not the best view in my opinion.
Honestly, balcony seats are really good, they arent the nose-bleeds like you would think, theyre located over the 200 section. 

If you book online ONLY:
http://www.nynyhotelcasino.com/entertainment/entertainment_zumanity_promotions.aspx
there is a 25% off discount on SELECT shows, the online booking will select the BEST AVAILABLE in whatever price category you choose. But if you call, an agent can help you select a preferred area, be sure to ask for military, student, hotel guest, local, or other promotional offers that may be running (can range from 25-40% off).

Be careful though, if you sit in any of the 100 sections, there is a chance youll be pulled up on stage for audience participation. Ive seen women go up there in short short skirts and leave very embarrassed. lol

GO with an open-mind!

I just found this website, its cool, promotes the hoop girl...most dudes dig her :)
http://www.zumanityhoops.com/game.cfm"
Zumanity,"Ive seen Zumanity 7 times as well as many other Cirque shows.  This ranks amongst my favorite because it is different and I never find my mind wandering during the show.  Yes, it is supposed to be the sexy side of cirque but it is not offensive (or if you get offended you may be slightly uptight).  Each act is totally different from the rest.  You wont be disappointed."
Zumanity,"Zumanitys tagline, The sensual side of Cirque du Soleil, is incredibly misleading.

the show is neither sensual nor is it Cirque du Soleil as weve come to expect.

there was actually very little of the acrobatics that make the Cirque famous: a couple of contortionists, some impressive dancing, a great hula hoop act, and some unspectacular fabric trapeze work and thats it.  the rest was a bunch of chicks running around baring their breasts and being chased by guys with a rubber dildos...

as to the sensual, nothing could be further from sensual.  i found shows like O much more sensual than this weak vaudevillian har har crude sex joke narrative.  it was more like being at finocchios in SF (check your history folks) with a couple of sensationally under-utilized acrobats.

frankly it was a big turn off after an especially excellent day in vegas.

if youre into vaudeville, have not seen beach blanket babylon a few times, watch la cage aux folles religiously, enjoy trite penis jokes, and are not looking for the spectacular heights of physical human achievement that mark the other Cirque shows, you might actually enjoy Zumanity.

not me.  it left me cold and shriveled..."
Zumanity,"Im torn on Zumanity.  It really held my interest in the beginning.  The acts were great and the comedians were funny.  But about 45 minutes in, I was checking my watch.  The two girls in the big water glass thing were great, and the midget with the curtain thingies was amazing too!!  There was also a chain/swing act that was amazing.  I think that if the show would have been maybe 30 minutes shorter I would have been happy with it.  I wouldnt go see this again, but I dont regret going.  I did prefer Absinthe to this though."
Zumanity,"This show was amazing. Im sure after, everyone wanted to spice up the bedroom:)

The Hostess of the show was very entertaining and funny (drag queen). I was into the show the WHOLE time and didnt want it to end as soon as it did! The live music is amazing and so were all the hard working performers. We got the 2 show/$100 deal and got pretty good seats. 

If you can, I would highly recommend this show to be seen with your special person (not your family or a parent...how awkward!!!). Its supposed to be a sentual show about exploring the world of sex so be prepared for alot of nudity and risque performances! They also grab people from the audiance to come on stage so you better hide if your shy cause theyll get ya!!"
Zumanity,"I absolutely loved this show! It is fun, erotic, sensual, and acrobatic all in one! The show is produced tastefully to not let the sex be overbearing. The stunts were amazing while some of parts of the show were hilarious. The host is a doll because she (or should I say he) interacts with the audience with the perfect amount of comic and courtesy. Besides, O at Bellagio, Zumanity is definitely my favorite Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. You pay half of the price compared to O but I believe you are likely to be even more entertained by Zumanity than O."
Zumanity,"This was the first Cirque show that Ive see. The boyfriend and I watched this last December (yes, I know, late review) and it was so fun to watch! 
We bought tickets for the couch seating and because it was December and not that many people were there, we got upgraded to the couches in the very front! I could literally reach out and touch the stage from my seat! That was really cool of them! 
This is a very sexy show! They have scenes with 2 girls swimming and sliding around in a big bowl of water, they have a hula hoop girl (this was my boyfriends favorite part), a bedroom scene, and all kinds of different, sexy, wacky, funny scenes! The hosts are pretty funny too!
For those who want to see a sexy,sensual show, but not like the trashy stip joints or nudey shows, this one is a great one to watch!
Just dont bring the kids!!"
Zumanity,"What a disappointment!

I had been to several different Cirque Du Soleil shows and i must say thoroughly enjoyed most of them. This was a very watered down version of Cirque Du Soleil. It had a couple of pieces that were sexy, but many pieces that were irrelevant. For instance they had a ten minute piece where a dwarf comes out on stage and does tricks with a white sheet hanging down from the top, he would float over a small section of the audience. You could hear a pin drop, What does this have to do with Cirque Du Soleil or how is that sexy enough for Zumanity?

There were some good comic relief bits that were actually quite funny. 

All in all, I wouldnt go to see this one again, but dont take my word for it, go see it for yourself. You just might like it."
Zumanity,"This is not the most spectacular Cirque du Soleil show, nor was it the most sexy thing I have ever seen in my life, but they do some pretty amazing stuff.  After a while you kind of forget that the performers are practically naked because they have the most fit and crazy gymnast bodies and they dont even look like people.

Overall it was a good time, but next time I see a show I would probably rather go to one of the bigger ones."
Zumanity,"Le sigh.  This is not a good Cirque show.  It was entertaining, but just not as good as it could have been.  I suppose, it depends on expectations. If having exhibitionists prance turns you on, and you want to pay $200 for visual foreplay, I d push it to a 4 star rating.  I was not looking for visual foreplay.  

Please note: Im a Cirque addict. I have seen 10 different shows, and as often as I can afford them.  This was the weakest show Ive seen by them.  

Topless female Cirque performers well, are pretty much as flat chested as boys, so if youre looking for boobs, you wont find them in much abundance here.  There were a couple of excellent acts.  The girls in a fishbowl were sensual and beautiful.  The aerialist duo was very cool, but there is just so much better out on the strip to see.

It hurts me to give only 3 stars to any Cirque show, but well, it just didnt deserve it."
Zumanity,"This show was sexy, hot, and hilarious!  Our seats were first row balcony, because based on past reviews we knew wed be safe from involuntary participation.  The interaction with the crowd below us was so fun to watch, especially prior to the show starting.  

The acts were, for the most part, incredibly sexy.  In a really good way. In a I wish I could do that at home, and maybe after a couple drinks I might think I can, but instead end up with about 10 pulled muscles sort of way.  Especially the 2 women in the water....wowsers!  Now thats talent!

An entertaining show all around!  Oh, and the margarita from the man upstairs was deeeeeeelicious!"
Zumanity,"so everytime i visit vegas I always make sure i catch one of the Cirque shows.. this time boyfriend and I decided on Zumanity.. I was a little worried at first after seeing mixed reviews about the show, but I LOVED it! 
Yea its not exactly like your typical Cirque show but it was sensual, funny, and you will enjoy the show regardless of your sexual preference. Its a show that caters to both straight and gay. I liked how they incorporated many different elements into the show, the use of lighting, props and color were brilliant! 

Boyfriend and I both thought it was a great show to watch with your significant other. It is sensual, theres plenty other shows in vegas thats sexual I thought Zumanity definitely set themselves apart from those. 

You can get your photos taken right when you enter the theater, they provide boas. Its quite nice they photoshop it so it has roses as background and the date, a great souvenir i thought."
Zumanity,"Sensual may not be the right word to describe this show. Maybe a dirty side of Cirque Du Soleil or a slutty side... Anyways, youre warned when you buy your tickets that it contains sexual content. This was my fourth installment of a Cirque Du Soleil show and it was cool to see something like this. 

It was definitely sexy. Nudity is a definite theme but its somehow done tastefully in my opinion. They had some S&amp;M themed acts which may be a bit kinky for some, but I think for the younger crowd is entertaining. The comedy relief from the actors are hilarious. If youre a conservative type who would get offended by the most crude of sexual innuendos and jokes, save your money and go to another show. But if youre looking for a good time and a real Las Vegas sensual show, this is a great time."
Zumanity,I loved this show!! Would really recommend couples going. Its very intense and hilarious at times. Was really a good show.
Zumanity,"I really liked this show! It was sexy and provocative and very, very cool. The acrobatics were melded into the story line in an interesting way, and even though it was a variety show format, I felt there was a great deal of coheasion among the acts. The dancers where beautiful and interesting to watch, the acrobats impressive. Theres quite a bit of nudity and if youre prudish, you might be put off by some of the implications on stage, but it was a great show."
Zumanity,"Saw this show about 7 years ago, Loved it then. Saw the show again this weekend, Still loved it.  Its a must see when in Vegas. We sat in the Lower Orchestra both times second to the last row great view."
Zumanity,"I was very unimpressed and disappointed with this Cirque show. Ive O, KA, Mystere, and Viva Elvis and I enjoyed all of those more than this show. Never again!"
Zumanity,"I absolutely LOVED this show. The theatre is small and intimate and we had awesome seats. We were sitting in the second section, the first row along the walkway and it was awesome because the performers before the show were walking up and down the walkway literally right in front of us. In fact one a few them even stopped and bothered my boyfriend. It was pretty funny. 

The pre-show was hilarious. Antonio and the bigger ladies were so funny and I knew we were in for a great show.

Some highlights were the hula hoop girl, the 2 topless girls in the martinin glass full of water and the scotch boobs. 

I definitely recommend this show and those who say otherwise dont know what theyre talking about. It was funny and sexual and full of talent. Next time were in Vegas Im seeing it again ;) Just dont sit in the front if youre shy."
Zumanity,"Zumanity is fun, cleaver, a little raunchy, and a lot of fun. Its pure Vegas and the audience on the night we were there had a great time.....I have seen other Cirque shows, Love {awesome}, O {good}, Mystere {great} and Zumanity while not my favorite was made fun by the naughtyness and audience participation."
Zumanity,"S.Heart and I enjoyed the show! Ive never been to a Cirque show before, and this was a great way to kick off more to come. I dont know why other people complain that this show is bad or tasteless. The description clearly states what kind of show this is. If youre into this kind of stuff, dont come! 

I was wow-ed by the acrobatic stuff and I enjoyed the short skits. Zumanity really is a fun activity when youre in vegas. I liked it!"
Zumanity,"Its an adult show. I like the show mostly because both actors and actresses interacted with the audience, thats so cool. 

You wouldnt get bored, the show would keep you laughing in your seat. 

And anyone want a banana?"
Zumanity,"Loosen up Urself, dont be so serious then U will enjoy Zumanity to the fullest!

I had some good laugh and wonderful time watching the show. ^_^"
Zumanity,"After being hyped as super risque I was expecting something a little bit edgier and unique.   I had actually been told that people left because some of the male scenes were too provocative for them.  I really cant see why anybody who comes to this show knowing that it deals with sexuality could be offended by any of it.  I thought the vocalists and the dancers and acrobats were very attractive and talented it just wasnt the show I was expecting.  I thought it would be more shocking and maybe more like  love and O where there is a lot more going on at the same time.  I just wasnt all that impressed with it as a whole.  It was what it was.  I am sure a lot of people would find it risque enough.  It just wasnt edgy enough for me. Perhaps I am just too jaded...   I would like to see a Zumanity two sometime that would push the envelope a little more.  I saw a smaller show, Fashonistaas, that I liked more that was at Krave last year.  I guess this show was just missing more edgy kinky stuff which is what I expected more of from a  show that claims to explore eroticism like Zumanity does.

One complaint I do have about the venue was the theater was kind of stuffy.  The place seems poorly ventilated.  Maybe they could actually turn up the air some or install some more vents.

The theater is small so I dont recommend spending a lot of money for expensive seats.  We were quite happy with the theater stools.  They are actually were padded swivel chairs right on the edge of the balcony close to the stage.  They seemed to give us the best view of all the action for the smallest price."
Zumanity,"We arrived in Vegas and decided to get in relaxed state of mind pronto by attending Zumanity. It was pure joy and super fun. The theater is lovely, set is beautiful and music haunting or jovial as needed. All very well done. But what makes this show is a fun loving and very talented cast. No matter their roles, all the performers are exceptional. This is Burlesque at it finest with talented singers, dance, acrobatics and fun campy skits. We sat in the sofa seats and enjoyed the proximity to the stage, you may well be party to some of the skits in the show but it is all in good fun. Let your hair down and enjoy this romp!"
Zumanity,"Thumb up! Great show, very funny (when it has to be funny), very sexy and overall over the top talented cast.
To fully take advantage of this show buy tickets as close to the stage as you can afford, its well worth it, the preshow fun is well... FUN!
Enjoyed it very much, every single second of it, very nice!"
Zumanity,"I loved Zumanity.

I loved it because it was sexual, sensual, funny, and hot without being exploitive. Throughout the show they touched on interracial relationships, s&amp;m,  homosexuality, androgyny, some serious edge play involving asphyxiation during an elaborate silks routine, characters who appeared to be transgendered all without being sensationalistic. The costumes were amazing, the performers were gorgeous. There was also some awesome hula hooping, a great underwater show, an amazing sound track, as well as some crass humor....but in the end, the constant theme of the show is to celebrate yourself, celebrate love, and celebrate your sexuality. Very positive overall.

Its not your typical Cirque show. Its set up like a burlesque cabaret. Each act is introduced by the emcee (who I just read is leaving at the end of this year...honestly I felt the emcee was the weakest part of the show, being a little too drag-campy for me) and it is not family friendly.

The venue is great, as it is relatively small, and if you order tickets in advance, you can choose to sit on loveseats on the side of the stage. pretty nice.

Id also suggest renting the film LOVESICK, which is a documentary on the preparation and opening of the show."
Zumanity,"Extremely sensual and sexy, but I found some of the intermediate filler acts a little awkward.  The 3 acts that stood out are hoops girl, midget jacked dude flying around, and sexy twins water dance. I think I saw a few people leave because they were offended, but if you lighten up and have a few drinks, itll be hilarious."
Zumanity,"Warning: This is not your typical cirque du soleil shows.  

The stage is very small and intimate.  No incredible acrobatic performance or crazy stage layout or massive amounts of performers at one time. 

This is a very sexy raunchy comedic performance which involves a lot of audience participation.  Its really sensual for all: hetero, homo, bi....whatever you are, it will entertain nonetheless.  Think of it as a circus show with showgirls and stand up comedy.  Its the best bang for your buck.

youll be laughing, oooo-ing, ahhh-ing, might even catch yourself moaning by the end of the show."
Zumanity,"What are some of you people saying?  1 Star? 2 Stars? No imagination?  It is because that there is nudity, that it makes you use your imagination... during AND after the show.  I was very impressed with the creativity and sexual energy of this show.

I have seen all the Cirque shows in Las Vegas now and i have to say, Zumanity ranks up there with O and KA.  True that the acrobatic element of Cirque Du Soleil is missing but the use of nudity and human sexual energy throughout the show keeps the audience entertained.

From beginning to end, the show keeps the audience involved in with jokes and tricks.  People sitting up front are always on their toes because they never know whats going to happen next.

A must see if youre able to tolerate fun sexual themes and nudity.  If you cant, then why da hell are you in Vegas?"
Zumanity,"Its not your typical Cirque show, in fact if your looking for something like O or Ka stay away. If youve got an open mind, or a hot date though, in my personal opinion its the best ticket in town."
Zumanity,"Did I miss something here?? This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and quite honestly didnt get it.  Yes, it was sensual and erotic.  Yes, they do things with their bodies that no normal human should be allowed to do. But seriously.... Whats with all the hype??

There are some redeeming factors, if you want to call them that.  The show is extremely interactive. The little guy will make you gasp. And it really is done tastefully. 

I doubt Ill make it back this particular show again, but Im ready to see other Cirque shows to see if we just saw a flop. And if youre fortunate to get discounted tickets, go. Its an experience."
Zumanity,"After being pleased with Cirque du Soliels Mystere, I made the mistake of letting my winnings ride, and I bet on another Cirque show: Zumanity. A show written for, and apparently by, confused hormonal eighth-graders. 

A friend of mine has a favorite saying when he goes to strip clubs: Lets not spoil it with words. (Anyone who has attempted to have a conversation with a stripper knows EXACTLY what he means.) Well, someone should have given that advice to whomever conceived of Zumanity. I havent seen such brainless, low-brow attempts at sexual humor and dialogue since I was in junior high school. Zumanity makes the American Pie movies seem like works of Shakespeare. 

The M.C. of Zumanity is some over-acted Dr. Frankenfurter-esque drag queen, who was given to some awful, trite little lines like, Isnt making love beautiful? like he was addressing a gathering of 17th century Calvinists who need convincing that sexual pleasure will not land them a place in eternal damnation. (This audience paid good money to see topless women trapeze through the air. You can safely skip the lecture.) The whole show was just an awkward mish-mash of, on one hand, graceful and suggestive acrobatic performances, and the other hand, crass and overt sexual humor. They need to pick a direction and stick with it; just trying slap them together is a trainwreck. If youre trying to lube us all up for a post-show hotel room fuck session, then why have a confrontational old drag-queen up there making everyones skin crawl. The mass tightening of sphincters was nearly audible every time he/she made direct eye contact with the audience. Im not exactly a prude...I managed to sit through an entire ice-skating performance of Johnny Weir in a lace corset without writing my Congressman...but I was short-stack of dimes for the entire 90 minutes of this so-called erotica. Even the obligatory orgy scene at the finale failed to register on the trusty ole Bone-o-Meter. (Yes, the Bone-o-Meter makes a cameo!)

There were a few redemptive moments, when the incredible athletes took the spotlight and did their thing. There was a stunning trapeze act with a guy swinging by one foot over the audience (without a net), an aerial-bound female orgasm (this one definitely got my attention), and other mildly clever performances involving a pearly white ribbons (hint, hint!) and a cage match between male rivals. But there wasnt enough of these acrobatic performances to save the show. Its like they ran dry after a few good ideas, and then just filled up the rest of the time with dick jokes."
Zumanity,I saw Zumanity a little over a year ago when I was in Vegas for my 21st birthday. This was the first Cirque show that I have ever seen and I was blown away. This show was sexy and fun. The actors are also extremely talented. The acrobats were my favorite. If youre in Vegas and want to see a talent filled show then definitely go see Zumanity. And be sure to get there about 30 minutes early. The interaction with the audience before the show is hilariously terrific!
Zumanity,Cirque du Soleil for adults.  Its a lot of fun and a lot of sexy.  Warning- do not buy lower orchestra seating unless you would like to be part of the show.
Zumanity,"Awesome show.  My wife and I were in the upper balcony, but right in the middle, lower section.  We thought the show was great and very entertaining overall.  The interaction with the audience throughout the show was hilarious.  The performances were amazing and very sensual throughout."
Zumanity,"Amazing, This is what a show should be. Fun, Sexy and impressive. It has wonderful audience interaction. The performers are some of the most athletic, beautiful and graceful people Ive ever seen. Go see it."
Zumanity,"Loved! Loved! Loved!  Good mix of humor, sexuality and fun!  Not for the faint of heart though, be prepared for suggestive and foul language and nudity!"
Zumanity,"We went last summer and I got these fabulous seats off the Cirque website. For less than 65 bucks (or around there) per person including tax, we had front row seat a little off to the side of the stage. I also booked a month beforehand, so its not like I booked waaaay in advance. We also got a free Zumantini each. I didnt think those were that great actually.

But the show was good. Granted, its a bit different from other Cirque shows because it has a lot of audience interactions and its very spontaneous. Im a bit of a prude but I can appreciate dirty jokes. I think thats why elsewhere on the web, people werent too fond of this show. Theyre usually Cirque regulars who dont like this one.

Since we were in the front, we were picked on by the host of the show and I got a postcard with his signature on it to go. The place is very small and intimate. Ive read that even the back seats have great views. Before the show, there are numerous performers who are in the audience giving out chocolate-covered strawberries and whatnot, so you dont even have to be in the front."
Zumanity,"I laughed. I screamed. I felt a little randy....

I really liked that they combine entertainment and amazement. Its like you get the best of both worlds - an amusing Cabaret with the crazy acrobatics of Cirque. Im also one of the guys and enjoyed the dirty jokes. Come on, were all adults here right? Id heard people complain that the nudity was over the top, but I really didnt feel any inklings of that throughout the performance. 

Dont sit in the front if you dont want to get haggled/asked to go up on stage! Theres a LOT of audience participation."
Zumanity,"Well, for my first Cirque de Soliel show, this one pretty much sucked.  I expected more.
The acrobatics were good and some of the stage settings were great.  however, the show really depended on easy humor for a crowd that may not have been as experienced as I was in life.  i dont mean that to sound arrogant, but I was not a good market segment for this show.
Plus, the venue was in the dank gross deep-fried New York New York hotel in Vegas.  
If you dont mind walking through a mall food court full of drunk people that are stupid, then this is the show for you."
Zumanity,"This was my favorite Cirque deu Soleil in all of Vegas.  Zumanity is different than most of the shows because it doesnt have as much acrobatics and is more performance.  Having said that the performers are still outstanding and the feats amazing.  Beware if you sit near the front because there is plenty of audience interaction.

Yes there is nudity and yes it can be raunchy but that is what makes it fun.  If you are the least bit up tight about such just stay away because the show is meant to be light-hearted.  I promise you will be highly entertained. ;-)"
Zumanity,You need to like burlesque to enjoy the show. I saw Mystère years ago and my wife really wanted to see something like that. Both of us left the show feel it was lacking. It was advertised as be sexual and it was lacking at that and missing much of what makes the other Cirque Du Soleil shows special. The only really enjoyable parts were when the show interacted with the audience.
Zumanity,"Well I have seen many a Cirque show and this one was not my favorite.  I wonder if everyone else here who rated this show 5 stars has actually seen any other Cirque shows ?  Zumanity was a good show, great music, the singers were excellent but the show itself was just ok.  Not sure if I was expecting too much but this show is not like any other Cirque show I have seen, there are no spectacular acrobatics or anything like that, its pretty tame and more focused on the story line and naked performers (topless anyway).  Not a terrible show but no one of Cirques best."
Zumanity,"Awesome!  Awesome! Awesome!

I would recommend going to one of those cheap ticket places to get your tickets.  There are no bad seats in the theater.  The venue is designed so you dont have to worry about someone really tall sitting infront of you and blocking your view.

There isnt much in Vegas in terms of gay-friendly but this definetly helps fill the void.  Whether youre gay, straight or somewhere in between I would recommend this show.  Make sure you get there early so you can take pictures with the sexy performers ;)"
Zumanity,"Sorry - I have to disagree with you 5 star people.  Zumanity was lacking...  

I was looking for Cirques version of a burlesque show.  If thats what youre looking for, dont waste your money.  

Yes, theres some nudity.  But nudity of contortionists...  I personally dont find that stimulating.  

I love Cirques use of water and acrobatics... I dont know why they arent used in the show.  And typically, you have the comedy duo to entertain you while they set up such stunts.  With no stunts, why do you need the raunchy couple?  

Then again - I thought they were one of the best parts...  Which should tell you something about the show.  

If I could only use one word - it would be disappointed."
Zumanity,"Wow did this turn into a shit show. I saw this years ago when it first opened, and I loved it, would have given it 5 stars then. Times have changed, and like New York New York, this show has definitely seen its day. Excuse me for being honest, but I felt it was a bunch of rejects from strip clubs who couldnt get a job so they hired them here. The woman looked tore up, methd out, there is nothing sexy about being road hard and put away wet, unless that look is in and I didnt get the message? The men, uh hemm, uh I think there were a couple, nothing hot about them either. This used to be very sensual, sexual, artistic, an entertaining, but this time I couldnt wait for it to be over, and not in a good way! There is nothing sexy (to me) about 2 guys making out, a midget making dry hump gestures, a bunch of gay men trying to pretend they are enjoying fondling a woman. It was just so forced, and awkward. Let me tell you, Im am totally open minded and I dont get offended, this was just boring. I guess the tourists from the Midwest would enjoy this, being the most scandalous show they have seen and the old men in the audience who havent seen a naked woman in years, but I say pass on this! There arent any great sexy shows in town anymore."
Zumanity,"What an amazingly fun show!

Edie, the hostess of the show was fun and kept the energy moving, along with all of the amazing performers. Its amazing to me that a show about all sorts of sensuality and sex would cause some of the audience to groan, when youre told specifically when you buy tickets what the show is all about. A scene with two men wrestling and kissing for just a moment brought groans from a couple of guys in the audience. Come on, folks. Its a show about sex and sensuality. Duh.  

I bought tickets through Half-price tickets, which cost about $78 per ticket for really good seats. Worth the trip!"
Zumanity,very fun and enjoyable show..it was my first and only show that i have been to tho. lots and lots of laughs to this show. it is not for people that get upset about cussing and nipples flaying around. very nice venue. only gets 4 stars cause i felt that they should have had waitress bring drinks around. buy the better seats they are well worth it.
Zumanity,This was an awesome show.  Saw it with a group of women but definitely recommend going with your partner!~
Zumanity,"Everyone kept telling us to see a CIrque show....glad we chose this one! It was very entertaining. Never having seen a Cirque show before, I can assume this one isnt as high flying as others may be, but they still put on a great show. As others have said, it is very risque...so be careful who you attend with. The host/hostesses are hilarious and do a great job interacting with the crowd. Kept us laughing! Some impressive acts by the performers - its amazing the talent they have. We were happy to be upgraded about 20 minutes in to a love seat on the front row. While it did not bother us, there is one scene with two men that may bother some (like the man behind us who was VERY uncomfortable and repeating thats enough!!!) Just be forewarned if thats something that may offend you - this show may not be for you. Go in with an open mind and get ready to be amazed and kept laughing, youll love it!"
Zumanity,Absolutely stunning!!  We spent the $300 for the couch seats last night. I dont know what else everyone is complaining about on here. Ive see all the cirque shows and this by far is the best one. All natural women and smoking hot men-especially the one with the pink Mohawk!!!!!!! YUMO!!! Go see it!!!
Zumanity,"GREAT comedy/ sex show...especially if youre a pervert..I like how they use many nationalities in this show..there was black, white, latino and asian performers which made them very unique and fun to watch. The host is so hilarious and after watching this show...you will want to f*** back at the hotel =P

P.S- Buy your tickets and tix4tonite...not at new york new york..you will save at least $30"
Zumanity,"This Cirque du Soleil was extremely funny, sexy and entertaining. I will admit it is not the best out there, but it is totally fun to watch. I came in with no expectations, and came out happy. 

I would recommend this show to people who are open minded. It is not for everyone. Just remember when you watch to have fun!!! 

I probably will not pay to watch it again, but at least I got to see it."
Zumanity,"amazing!
great show..
takes you where you need to be..
the staff was helpful!
the artists were just colorful and fun.
a definite date night experience!!
keep up the great work"
Zumanity,"Fantastic show.  Wanted to see it when I was here in 2005, and couldnt get tix.  Got to see it this time with free tix as part of Expedia package.  This was an AWESOME SHOW!  Loved it, I think they could make a show just from the 4 comedic acts."
Zumanity,"I havent seen a show in Vegas in awhile.  Came here this past week to celebrate my bf birthday and he wanted to see Santana, but of course I screwed up and his show got sold out the day of his birthday and he wanted to see Zumanity instead. 

I ended up purchasing our tickets through Vegas.com and got an excellent price for our tickets.  We payed the balcony price for orchestra seats.   We sat in the first row right behind the love seats.  

If youre open minded and youre willing to see a sensual show, Zumanity was AWESOME!!"
Zumanity,"We decided to watch this show last minute, we had a little gambling money and we said why not? We really didnt know what to expect since it was unexpected. The host is Hilarious and so were most of the cast members. There was topless women which my husband enjoyed and very hot men, too bad though that the hot men started making out at one point :( The show was very funny and entertaining. I would only watch it once but I do recommend it."
Zumanity,"Ive seen this show twice, and maybe thats why I was more impressed the first time.
This is a different kind of Zumanity show...more risque and less abstract.
There is not a bad seat in the house so dont be scared to sit in the balcony.
The only disappointment I had the second time was my favorite part of the show was changed!  The two chinese water acrobats were now one white girl.  BORING.  Someone must have been sick!!
Also they changed the chubby tranny for a slimmer and not as funny version.  GET RAUNCHY!! The second time seemed tamed down to me!!
The little man is the best!! I think all of the performers are awesome and I love the fat girls!!
Overall highly recommended but  dont bring grandma or sit next to the lady i did.  She was gasping for air by the time it was over!"
Zumanity,"Sexy, tantalizing, beautiful and campy describe this wonderful Cirque show.  Ive seen this one twice and was surprised that the gang part of the show was not part of the program the 2nd time around...that was very hot scene.  Anyway, the girls in the martini glass are sensuous and beautiful.  

Definitely worth a trip to NYNY to catch this show even for open minded prudes.  Closed minded prudes may want to go to the Debbie Reynolds hotel and catch a dinner and a show....did they tear that one down already?"
Zumanity,"An incredible Cirque-meets-cabaret show.  Not for everyone though.  If youre not open minded then dont even bother.  However, if you are, you will be in for a treat as Cirques performers once again inspire and make you appreciate the beauty of the human body in motion while exploring themes involving various forms of sexuality.

The theater is unique and absolutely gorgeous.  If you can, spring for the high back couch seats."
Zumanity,"Loved it. Overall a good combination of sexy, raunchy, and funny. It kept me super entrrtained and the husband of course loved the amount of boobies he saw ; ) I would have given it five stars if it was just a little longer!"
Zumanity,"I LOVE zumanity. 

I love how they begin entertaining the audience as we wait for the show to begin. I wasnt expecting any comedy but they were hilarious! There was a lot of amazing talent, including the singers (WOW). My boyfriend was  totally skeptical towards watching this show but he ended up loving it in the end! I would totally see this show again. It was very sexy, edgy, and erotic. 

Tip: Get yourself the zumantini or the blue balls drink....super delishhh"
Zumanity,"WOW...this show can make a porn star blush!!! LOL! Its all about sexuality and sensuality and they didnt leave any stone unturned...I mean they explored ALL aspects of our human needs! Its very adult themed, but its by no means anything like going to a sleazy strip joint (although they did include a pole dancer - Cirque du Soleil style - in one of the scenes). Its very provocative, but what it comes down to is LOVE between human beings and their need to be LOVED...its beautiful!!! 

Its an hour and a half without intermission and it goes by very quickly. The show is very entertaining...I guess you can call it a modern day burlesque show. Theres alot of Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, singing, dancing, music, comedy, skits, and they do involve the audience quite a bit, esp if youre sitting in the orchestra section...its very interactive (in more ways than one!) The theater is a good size, but you can still have a decent view of everything thats going on no matter where youre sitting. We sat in the balcony section about 3 rows up and we were fine. 

Its a must see!!!"
Zumanity,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this show! I bought my tickets on orbitz and got two tickets in the second row for about $60 each. It started off really funny with the two twins and I absolutely loved the emcee. A few of the sketches were in my opinion a tiny bit sleezy, but it is a show about sex and it is Las Vegas, so I wasnt surprised. The waterbowl and the hand to hand and Scotch Baggies were my favorites but the others werent too far behind. 

You definitely need to keep an open mind going into the show as there are a few parts that can be seen to some as controversal. Also if you are going with your significant other and they get picked to go on stage, dont get upset with whatever happens because its just a show and now that Ive warned you, you have no excuse to be mad. 

Also, the venue was a lot more cozy than the other shows so even from the 10th row up you can see everything (based on my friends account who seen the show).Overall, performances were hot, the men were even hotter, everything about this show was great. I would definitely go again."
Zumanity,"Awesome show! I really enjoyed it. If you sit in the front or in seat number 69, you will be picked on by their zany characters. Some cast members come out before the show starts to mess with the audience. Overall it was really fun and unbelievable."
Zumanity,This was a fun and funny show. My wife and I had a great time!
Zumanity,"Sensual, erotic, fun, playful, adult, and simply a good time. Would bring my money back to this show any day!"
Zumanity,My favorite show on the strip. Its an adult show but in the right way. Its also very funny. Cant wait to see it again.
Zumanity,"My husband and I were very excited to see this show. The reviews were great so we bought the best seats we could get which were located in the left side of the stage in the cushioned love seats. Unfortunately these were the WORST seats ever and we paid full price for them. The lighting director should be fired!! They put spot lights on the acrobats as they flew through the air which ended up directly in our eyes. It was awful and I find it hard to believe he did not see us squinting the whole time as the light was unbearable and ruined half the show for us. I ended up with a head ache and was very angry. It was VERY unprofessional. The Choreography was terrible and did not show off the performers in a sexy beautiful way at all which was disappointing. The music was live but completely forgettable and did not seem to flow well with the performers acts. Even the host of the show was old and ugly. I truly thought this show had HUGH potential and the people who organized the show were clueless and inexperienced. It was a train wreck. 

The only reason I am EVEN rating this a one star was because the performers were amazing and their were some comedic parts that made me laugh. 

I DO NOT recommend this show. It is not worth one dollar to see."
Zumanity,"Sexy...Naked...Lesbian...Man Lovin!

Agree with others: humor is dorky. But the acts themselves are amazing."
Zumanity,"We loved this show.  It was beautiful, funny, and a nice break from our normal mundane reality.  I can see that some people may be offended by some of the scenes, my husbands eyes went up above his forehead (cartoon style) during a male scene, but it was really awesome.  Exploring sexuality through theatre means all sexuality-- really really good.  

Zumanity offers a 35% military discount, we preordered the tickets.  I wanted to make sure I could get seats that I could leave if I needed to (pregnant and needing to pee all the time), and ours were lovely."
Zumanity,"Pretty good show. If youre in Vegas, I recommend seeing it (and stay far FAR away from theCSI: Experience, it is ungodly terrible). There is a lot of crowd interaction that personalizes Zumanity. Its filled with tons of comedic skits. However, I expected it to push the envelope further with the sexual idea---considering its Vegas---but the show is pretty tame in that respect. Overall, a good show that is well worth the price."
Zumanity,"Most normal people will not enjoy this show.  I read some of these reviews, and they must be written by performers, or business partners related to this show or the company.  I have seen many Cirque Du Soleil shows, and this was by far the worst.  Think Cheesy.  Think Drag Queen hosted.   It is not a good date show, and will certainly not put either one of you in the mood.  Yes, there were a few portions of the show that were good and interesting, and a few that were funny, but overall, most people will leave the show disappointed.   I bought the show at half price, and was disappointed, so imagine how disappointed you will be if you pay full price?"
Zumanity,"Sexy, fun entertainment. Acts ranging from artistic to romantic to outrageous. Generally playful and in good taste. Dont sit in the first 10 rows unless you want to potentially be embarassed onstage. Lots of boobs. Very hetero-centric, very Vegas, very Cirque."
Zumanity,Zumanity was a big hit! It was sexy and funny. They made a good use of the stage. Felt like I was on another planet.
Zumanity,"I was really disappointed with this Cirque!

I was truly looking forward to an erotic sensual experience, naked bodies, amazing costumes, and the beauty and artistry that I have come to know with other CDS performances.  

Zumanity just didnt live up to its advertising or trailers.  They really could have created an artistic masterpiece and pushed the limits, instead, Zumanity was a bawdy cabaret act - less artistry more in your face nakedness...also their attempt to address different aspects of sexuality seemed blatant instead of creative...certainly not their best showing!"
Zumanity,"The show was pretty good, but I would of loved to see more of artistic/actrobatic moves. It had more sexual moves and humor. 
I liked most of the show. The beginning was a bit tacky and I did not care to see the audience get involved as much as they did. I guess I should of went to see O if I wanted all the artistic moves and less audience interaction. 
I got discount tickets for Zumanity and it was the only Cirque De Soleil show that was affordable enough for me. 
All in all if was a pretty good 1st show for us. 
I also enjoyed the live music very much. 
My husband really loved this show and all the interaction with the audience."
Zumanity,"What a great show!  Having seen eight Cirque shows this was by far the most fun of them all - I laughed a lot, I cringed when watching the male contortionist, I loved it all - Will go and see it again...."
Zumanity,"OK, so I am a very traditional, conservative girl, which was why this show (particularly the female orgasm) made me uncomfortable. But here is the thing: The acrobatic acts are nothing you dont see in any other Cirque du Soleil show. During the hula hoop act, I kept thinking, Ive seen this before in another Cirque du Soleil show. Same with the female orgasm. And a few other acts. Same acts, different name."
Zumanity,"Dont waste your time going to this show. For the price, I was expecting so much more. It was distasteful &amp; not entertaining at all. Halfway through, i was bored &amp; wishing I was somewhere else. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews that were posted. What a joke..."
Zumanity,"We received ticket for the show thru our hotel, the Bellagio, and wasnt sure it was going to be such a great show. We were wrong. The show and staff were great! I would like to especially thank Adnan for being one of the best hosts/staff members we have meet with in Las Vegas. Finding out we were there for my sisters wedding, Adnan, gratefully upgraded our seats. This was so nice of the team members and it made the show even better. I will be recommending Zumanity to my friends and family. Thank you Zumanity &amp; Adnan."
Zumanity,The show is funny and sexy in an intimate setting. Id definitely recommend Zumanity for couples looking to enjoy a show with a little bit of everything.
Zumanity,"This show was so much fun!  I really enjoyed it.  It was funny and the performers were very talented and entertaining.  There was alot of bare breasts and thongs.  Some of the men were attractive, but I dont enjoy seen a man in a sparkling thong.. eww.  or cut off daisy-dukes.. lol.  My favorite act was probably the 2 girls in the big see-thru tub with water.  Very cool.  Great for couples.  And if you are sitting close to the stage, prepare to participate in the show!  Fun, Fun!!"
Zumanity,Aboslutely LOVED the Zumanity show. It was a hilarious and exciting celebration of sexuality. I will go again the next time Im in Vegas.
Zumanity,"I enjoyed this show as well, but I enjoyed Mystere more. 

It was funny that the ushers and the ladies wearing that weird thong suit asked my sister if she was 18! hahahah! remember kids, you have to be an ADULT to watch the show!

*WARNING*SPOLIER BELOW*
The only thing that bored me to death was the 2 guys in the cage pretending theyre wrestling each other, then at the end they kiss! hhahhhahahaha!

The topless girls were hot!! I loved it, but Id rather not watch this show again. Too many others to see. (O, KA, LOVE &amp; BELIEVE!)"
Zumanity,"I love Vegas shows and was really excited to see Zumanity since one of my friends had seen it and said it was very sexual and exciting, but I found it to be far less than that. It did have its funny parts and I enjoyed those inbetween intermission stages, but sexual? = yes, turn on? = no. 

Its hard to be turned on by naked bodies that are so rail-thin that ribs stick out further than the boobs do....AND, it must be said - when men go to boob bars and even shows like this, the woman at least tries to be sexy and sensual, but as a woman, when we go to see the men strip and/or shows like this they always do some silly skit that in no way, shape or form would turn a woman on. I mean he skips out wearing tight zip-apart jeans with a fur hoodie coat and white cowboy boots for crying out loud. 

There was a lot of whips and chains when I prefer the sweet, sensual, seductive route it simply wasnt for me."
Zumanity,"Im not really sure If i saw a different show than everyone else did but this show was terrible. The performances were really  basic as compared to other Cirque shows Ive seen. And I guess I was expecting something more artful. But instead it was trashy, crude, and not at all sexy. I think they missed the memo about what makes something sexy. But singing about masturbating , fencing with dildos, spraying silly string to look like a guy is cuming, and asking to audience to moan out loud with the host... lame. not sexy. not edgy. not interesting. Be Better, Cirque."
Zumanity,"I saw this show this past weekend and was very satisfied.  We bought our tickets from the half off place across the street, which made it convenient to pick our tickets up right away.  15 minutes before the show starts is a comedy preshow.  You should not miss it because this is not a circus filled with a lot of high flying acrobatic and wondrous tricks (although there are some), this is really a sensual, sexy comedy show.  It would be perfect if you went with a date, though I went with a sausage-fest of three other men, and we had a grand time. It was very interactive with the audience and lasted about an hour and a half.  

Some things to be aware of is that this is a gay friendly and partially nude show.  None of the guys strip fully, though there is a lot of dildo play, but almost all of the women are topless at one point in the show.  Also if you sit close to the stage, you may be invited to join the performers.  All but one of the audience members invited to join the actors were very good, however one was a buzzkill, so I can imagine more of those ruining it for the rest.  On the plus side, the performers are all professionals and were very good and turning things around.  If you sit in the balcony seating, you may have some trouble viewing the edge of the stage, so be aware.  Overall, the comedy was an A+, the acrobats were an A, though we wished there were more, and the lengthy of show was a B, as it could have gone longer since it drags you in.  After the show, NYNY has a lot of bars to grab a drink at and fine restaurants to eat before.  I would go again; just with a date."
Zumanity,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!! Antonio was great! I laughed and laughed..The overweight twins we freaking hillarious! The audience members they brought on stage were troopers!
Zumanity,"VERY SEXY SHOW! Very Vegas! Talented performances. A must see with your hubby, partner, or boyfriend. Its got something for everyone if you know what I mean, and it definitely gets you in the mood to have some dirty fun ;o)"
Zumanity,"This show was awesome! Great performers and it delivered on the theme of sassy and sexual! I had the best seat in the house, right in the front on a love seat for two. The performers had great talent and amazing bodies, I highly recommend that you check it out. The wonderful thing about the show is that they also integrated a comical perspective of human sexuality. One thing I wouldnt do is invite your parents or grandma to the show, it may be a little to racy for the elder generations because of the nudity and sexual atmosphere. Also the show was very gay friendly and the host is a big drag queen! The one negative was their service bar, the drinks were not that great, I would recommend that you have a couple of drinks prior to entering the theater."
Zumanity,"show was for 10/4 10pm.

it was.. beautiful, funny (hilarious!), the hostess of the show was awesome and beauiful in his own way.. the singers were GREAT! i mean its like wow. mind blowing.

I still dont understand the whole point and concept of the one guy running around with the fabric attached to his arms.. he only popped out twice to do that and that was the end. i did enjoy blue balls while watching this movie.. hehe :) im not kidding.. its an awesome drink.. 

the show is a bit erotic so please dont watch this with family.. im not sure how mom/dad would handle the show with boobs all over and people making out in the back ground..we got in a bit early as advised for the preshow.. the twim girls were hilarious as well.. dressed as maids..

if youre going to watch this try entering 15 min before the show.. cause they will entertain you and make you laugh before the show starts :D

oh and if youre in the front 2 rows beware! you will become a volunteer but most likely not willing.

also, dont forget to look at the peeps holes :P if you look at the walls some of the buttons are missing poke your eye in and enjoy a surprise!

we got awesome tickets.. but thankfulyl as requested the concierge at mgm grand got us tickets out of harms way.

bravo :P and an extra bravo for the volunteers that day especially toward the end.. i believe her name was debbie.. :D"
Zumanity,first show in vegas!  it was funny and enjoyed the performers.  very in love with the acrobatic mohawk hottie :)
Zumanity,The wife and I have been making an annual pilgrimage to Vegas for about 9 years now.  We have not repeated any shows up to this point.  We first saw Zumanity about 5 years ago and decided to go back this year.  THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!  Women should wear absorbent panties and men should wear loose fitting pants.  Enough said... GO SEE THIS SHOW!!!
Zumanity,"Bawdy. Bizarre. Erotic. Exotic. One of Cirque de Soleils most stunning productions, and definitely not one for the kids . . . or your Aunt Millie. Tourists from the Midwest probably shudder for all the wrong reasons as they sit through a series of sensuous and near-explicit vignettes that will tittilate even the most open-minded in the audience. Contortionists, exhibitionists, dancers, gymnasts, strippers, and aerialists take on the roles of flirtatious French maids, naughty school girls, limber Lotharios, seductive tarts, and S&amp;M aficionados, among others, in couplings that are both straight and gay. In a finale unlike any youve seen elsewhere, the cast emerges from every corner of the theatre and assembles on a slowly revolving stage where, as solos, duos, or trios, they simulate a cornucopia of sexual acts that will leave you sweaty and breathless. Throughout it all, a comedic quartet provides laughs to relieve the sexual tension charging the air. Not to be missed . . . nor to be seen with your Mom and Dad."
Zumanity,This was our first Cirque du Soleil show. It was great! Entertaining throughout the entire show. 2 for $99 ticket special was definitely worth it!
Zumanity,"I agree with Teri C. The silly side shows were entertaining, but not what I had thought. Also, boobs."
Zumanity,"This was boring, dull and not worth it!! I didnt think the tricks and acrobatics were that awe-inspiring or even entertaining and it was not very sensual. The best part was the girl in the ropes. She was hanging from the ropes and doing tricks while weaving her body in and out of the ropes. That part was good."
Zumanity,"If you like traditional Cirque shows, this is not for you. There is very little acrobatic or strong man performance in this one. I absolutely expected the nudity and racy script but I just didnt care for the shows sense of humor or acts. Neither my husband or I found it terribly entertaining. Just a bummer that we expected more action like a typical Cirque de Soleil. = (
Bummer"
Zumanity,"3.5 stars

The show was good, but not great. The show was probably the most similar to Mystere, in that it focused more on the individual talents of the performers more than on extremely high production values like other CdS shows. The performances were exciting and impressive. Im just not sure if the idea of it mixing with sexuality works... Maybe this would turn on couples more than a group of friends going. My favorite act was probably the 2 girls in the fishbowl. Some of the audience participation acts were hilarious, while some just seemed boring time fillers. Youll see boobs, strap-ons, dildos, g-strings (on males) through the show... dont say we didnt warn you.

The venue is pretty intimate, so no real bad seats compared to other Cirque shoes. Chill out in the lobby pre-show and you can take pictures with some of the hot performers. 

My current rankings of Cirque du Soleil-like shows seen in Vegas would probably be:

1. Mystere (best value)
2. KA (actual story line)
3. O (close to KA, but damn expensive)
4 &amp; 5. Toss up between La Reve and Zumanity.

Up next: LOVE!

TIP: Careful if youre sitting in the first row of the 2nd section (where the walkway is). IF you decide to make eye contact with the performers walking up and down the walkway pre-show, they might decide to come up to you and violate you, like it happened to me. Haha... j/k sorta..."
Zumanity,"I wanted to give this show 2.5 stars, Yelp needs to let us rate half points! 

The performers are amazing and their talent alone earns the show 2.5 stars. I think they should work on their choreography, when they rip off their top the act of unveiling isnt sexy, more like random. I think the nude part of the show would have been hotter as more of a strip tease act combined with cirque-esque performances. But thats not really what peeved me about the show. The show had WAY too much dialogue period and the dialogue was terrible! Watching the show reminded me of when I was in grade school and I had just learned a few swear words and I wanted to drop an F-bomb in every sentence. Puleeeeaassse! I know this was their attempt on making the show funny but it missed the mark and made it totally tacky. There were some amusing parts of the show, they had a comedian lady who did a liquor filled breast implants skit that made me and pretty much everyone else laugh out loud but most of the time she was more cheese than funny. I wouldnt recommend you see this show unless you get a student discount, or one of those deals at the half off tickets place. Shell out a few more dollars and see Cirques O show!"
Zumanity,"Went to see this show while on my honeymoon in Vegas. We LOVED it. Great combination of humor, sex, and some of the typical Cirque style acrobatics. The cast is so funny in this show, and I love the drag queen host. All though, it took my husband until the end of the show to figure out it was a drag queen. Thats how good she is. :)

The audience participation is the best part of the show. The dancing is gorgous and there are some amazng acts, but that really is the reason to go. If you want to see lots of acrobatics, go to another show.

Also, I just wanted to say that I found the number of single, older men in the audience to be a bit creepy. I actually had to sit next to one of them. This isnt really a show I would expect to see a single man sitting in. Go with friends, or your SO before it makes it SO much better."
Zumanity,"You know, Cirque du Soleil is great brand and the shows they do are first rate. 
The concierge at the Trump was able to get us great seats for either Zumanity or O and we decided to go to Zumanity (hey, we were in Vegas, we needed to be little bit naughty!).
And, great seats they were...second row with our eyes right at stage level, and close enough to touch everything on the stage (although you wouldnt necessarily want to).
Boys and girls;girls and boys; girls and girls; boys and boys; old and young and pretty much every combination of the above that you would think possible. 
The show is very funny in spots, certainly beautiful all the way through.
The acts themselves are everything you would expect from CdS, funny, magical, awesome in many respects.
There is so much athletic talent on the stage, that the stories they are trying tell get a little lost in the acrobatics and sometimes things feel a bit  disjointed (much like the contortionist in his underwear...creepy but strangely funny).
The price you pay for great seats at this show is that the performers feel duty bound to interact with you. The Beautiful Carin and I found ourselves dragged into the proceedings 2-3 times (we just wanted to see the show...is that so wrong?!?!?).
Anyway, beautiful, athletic, entertaining people...most of them naked or nearly so for the entire show...in an entertaining show with a little something for everyone."
Zumanity,"A great show!! it is worth every penny and dime! Hilarious, classy, and just damn right GREAT!!!! They get the audience involved and the show itself is very passionate and very compelling, spell binding... just awfully GREAT! Love each and every skit. There was not a dull second! I laughed so much and I was so warm. It was just amazing all around. This show is definitely not for kids!! a lot of adult humor. Great looking actors and host. A very open-minded show. Please prepare yourself to be hit with everything! Thats what the show is all about... exploring everything."
Zumanity,"This is the third Cirque show that I have been to. It is way different than the others. The show was very risque. If you go, be prepared for nudity, adult language and heavy sexual content. The show covers all sexual orientations and several fetishes. So if you have a hard time with that, I wouldnt recommend that you go. We made the mistake of sitting in the third row but luckily, we were safe and did not get picked for a bit. Dont know how we would of handled that. The acrobatics were incredible and it was a beautifully staged show."
Zumanity,"LOVED this show. It made me laugh so hard - the audience participation is hilarious - if you are uncomfortable with audience participation, sit farther back because it could be uncomfortable if you are chosen. And there is quite a bit of participation!!

I took my boyfriend - he enjoyed it as they are many, many, many topless women. The acrobatics are actually really good and typical of cirque shows but there were not as many acts as other shows would have. I enjoyed the sensual, out-of-the-box thinking of this one. DEFINITELY an adult show - and do not go if you are easily made uncomfortable or are easily offended. If you are an open minded, fun person - you will enjoy this show greatly.

We sat in section 203, the last row before the stools and our seats were perfect."
Zumanity,They dragged me on stage and made me shake it with some other guy from the audience! Ahhhh! The actors were hilarious and total dynamic of the cast was really good. I was impressed by the two girls in the fishbowl. Id definitely see the show again.
Zumanity,"Fun night out... The cirque part was underplayed...Dancers were dancers more than acrobats...But as a classy burlesque show with some really fun audience participation and comedy, the night was a true success!"
Zumanity,"I suppose if O is 5 stars then this would be less but still I will give it 5.  It was terrificly funny and sexy.  Yes, there were a few slow moments but all in all is was very enjoyable."
Zumanity,Maybe if I hadnt seen Absinthe the night before it might have been better. I had high hopes for this show based on the reviews. I was disappointed in the amount of acrobatics it lacked. The preshow was hilarious though! The show was slow and had me looking at the time if it was over yet. Would not recommend with plenty of other show options available in Vegas.
Zumanity,It was entertaining only because you see boobies and it got some good funny parts with interaction with the crowds.  Other than that no WOW factor on stage design or arial moves.  Just topless girls tumbling and dancing and the girls were ok nothing HOT.  If you want to see a sexual show with some hot girls i recommend crazy horse at mgm.
Zumanity,"Amazing show. Provocative, sexy and arousing. Definitely sets the mood for later in the evening if you know what I mean ; ) Worth every cent &amp; I cant wait to see it again. The whole cast was amazing they all came together to make the show what it is. I LOVED IT!!"
Zumanity,"This show is not for everyone.  It is a strip club with acrobats.  Would recommend for couples.  I enjoyed it, but not my fav Cirque."
Zumanity,"Second time seeing this show. This time, we were seated center, third row. These seats were completely worth the extra price. Had a great time, the show was excellent."
Zumanity,"Overall, Zumanity was about as sexy as a train wreck and as sensual as a visit to the dentist. It seems that Cirque du Soleil executives were aiming to compete with Stand Up Comedy, The Chippendales, variety shows, and strip shows, so they created a mash-up that tries to serve up all of this, but merely ends up being a blend of sophomoric vulgarity, boring circus acts, and low grade comedy. 

We noticed that the audience was not laughing at the comedy, yet mysterious laughter was emanating from the speakers behind us. It is truly tragic that canned laughter was necessary. Although in hindsight, the fake laughter was the perfect accompaniment to the fake audience participation sequences! We felt that the audience applauded at the end of the comedy routines out of politeness and sympathy for the performers, and perhaps relief that each excruciating and overlong segment was at an end!.   

To be fair, there were some spectacular performances, about 15 minutes worth in all. But you can see the best bits for free by watching the video billboard on the strip for 30 seconds.  The best thing about Zumanity is that it only lasts around 90 minutes."
Zumanity,"The show is great! The people are beautiful and talented. I am comfortable with all the contents. They are sexy and funny but not too cheap. They have great singers. I wish the sound effect can be more delicate with more layers.  And, I wish to see more beautiful colors of  bodies."
Zumanity,"What I really love about Zumanity is how much it embraces the comedy aspect of burlesque. Humor is sexy! This is a cabaret act, part acrobatics, part chamber art piece. If all you want to see is topless flexible chicks, please go to one of the many many other shows that caters to you. This one is special."
Zumanity,"Friends were going to watch O sunday night, and wanted to make the most of our vegas trip so we stopped by tix4tonight at the fashion mall to see what shows they had available for the night. I didnt really want to spend a ton of money, but still ended up paying $80 (after all the fees) for the balcony seating. As for the show ...

BOOBS. love them. Especially when theyre twirling in the air, flipping around, and splashing in water. The best part was that i didnt have to tip them a dollar each time.

I was almost able to stay up the entire show but did the whole, if i just close my eyes for a second ill feel better. Not that the show was boring, but when its 11pm and dark i can get sleepy.

The thing was that you have to pick up your tickets at least an hour before the show, and it was all the way down at New York New York and we had dinner rsvp at RAO at Ceasars in an hour. So we cabbed it over there, had to walk to the other side of the hotel pick up the tickets, then walk all the way back to catch a cab to dinner."
Zumanity,"Horrible Show!! This wasnt even good erotica. The show had no point to it. I was ready for some good, risqué, sexually charged evening. All I got was an male cross-dresser for an emcee, a latin lover that was repulsive and blaringly homosexual, and a little blonde comedy relief that had no boobs. There was nothing about this that even hinted at being a Cirque show, if I were the true Cirque preformers, I would be offended. If one is gonna offer erotica, then lets get on with it. If its gonna be like Zumanity, dont waste your money."
Zumanity,"We recently saw Zumanity and I have to say it was amazing. The show was funny, entertaining, and dripping with sexuality. The dancers were extremely talented and beautiful. The fact they were topless made the show all the better. Many times during the show, spectators were singled out and brought on stage to participate. It was hilarious and filled with good fun. I only wish I had been one of the lucky few to be included. Alcohol was sold at the concession, as well as some very tasty Jell-O shots, popcorn and snacks. I would defiantly recommend seeing this show. I would even go see it again. It was that good."
Zumanity,"I absolutely loved Zumanity for its risque performance. My mind is naturally in the gutter and Zumanity only nurtured it more. It was so entertaining. Sexually oriented with the performers contorting into lovely positions, people making out, and everyone performing like one giant orgy. Okay so it was raunchy but still classy and humorous. At that time I bought tickets for the Duo Sofa and I was with a couple of my friends. Totally comfortable, loved the drinks, and the hot bods. One of my most memorable shows! I dug it a alot!"
Zumanity,Ive watched other Cirque du Soliel shows and this was the worst one Ive seen.  I dont mind the raunchy sexual content but the show itself was not entertaining at all.  The performance were unimpressive other than lot of grabbing and sexually charged acts.  I wouldnt recommend it.  Go watch the O or Jubilee.  Its much more entertaining.
Zumanity,I attended thus show with my husband who was in Las Vegas on business. The show was AWESOME!!! We both loved it! It was erotic and entertaining; some parts were comedic. I would see it again. The nudity didnt bother us at all. It was very sensual and seductive. Dont go if you are uncomfortable with this type of stuff.
Zumanity,"This is not the usual Cirque Du Soleil so I dont recommend it for first timers who are wanting all the daring big acrobatics and such. Go see KA, O or go to Le Reve (Not a Cirque but done by Dragone, who created many of the Cirques).If a sexy show isnt your cup of tea, if youre conservative to various sexual lifestyles and crude humor  again- skip on this. I you do want to just have fun, see something lighthearted and sexy then get some tickets. The whole point of this Cirque is to break from that typical cirque style and have fun. Even they explain that on the sites show concept. I had to separate in lumping this together as a Cirque fan or Id probably set myself up for being disappointed if I held a belief that this was going to be much like the rest.

The dirty jokes- not the most creative but still its all in simple silly fun. Lots of silly campy stuff too. I also enjoyed the dragqueen emcees energy and the live band is awesome! Were music people and they play well and are the better of the bands that do the Cirques. This has lots of audience participation and most participations are very sexual so if you are shy dont sit downstairs near the front- they will mess with you! 

I watched with my parents, my fun aunt from Cali and a conservative uncle visiting from Florida and my boyfriend of course. Awkward company right? Still fun since my parents and aunt can laugh so its all good but this is normally not a place for family. I think my uncle was too shocked to comment except for so this is Vegas, huh? Wow. I uhm didnt know that was like that.  I think it wasnt his kind of show, but he decided to tag along with us. 

 I think its great for the special promo price we got for our tickets, but I dont know if I would pay full price even though I  had fun. Its hit/miss, love/hate kind of show so if youre on the fence about how youd like it Id probably recommend to wait for a ticket special too. Great bachelorette party show or fun date night. Overall it was a fun time for me and am glad I went to see it.

UPDATE: A note for people who think everyone is a plant/ a backstage worker posing as a guest. I talked to a friend about this and apparently at another show (not Zumanity or a Cirque even), they were sitting near the front where its easy for performers to grab you. When she went to willcall they flagged her down and asked her to look at a paper that she had to sign if she wants to participate or not in the show. It was at random they pick people in the general area fitting the description of what they need (old couple, young girl, etc) . I think it makes sense for the nature of the show if youre a sexual target or are gonna get roasted in front of everyone to ask your permission first. I cant confirm if this is how this particular show works, but it makes sense. Many people repeat shows and I doubt they can provide that many plants to cycle throughout the year to not get caught. All the shows Ive seen a few times all had different people each night and Ive seen some shows upwards of 5-10 times. 

Also just because you didnt get picked for that doesnt mean they wont accost you in the front as they pass you by.  Ive seen random people get groped coming into the theater and people just sitting down touched or offered strawberries to eat from performers.

Have fun and stay sexy!"
Zumanity,"This is my first show, this is something that normally would not interest me but my g/f wanted to see it so we went. We got seats in the upper part of the lower section. It was a nice viewing distance for us. The pre show starts 15 minutes beforehand. Lots of aerobics, music, singing, comedy, crowd involvement and scandalously clad performers of course. Overall the show was quite entertaining. The strobe lights were a bit blinding a few of the times. Check out the promotions page at the nynyhotelcasino web site, they have deals on tickets."
Zumanity,"Just like everyone else has reported...this show is simply A-Okay. We had decent balcony seats (I was afraid to get the stool seats because I didnt know how comfortable they would be - but they looked really comfortable.) We were in the second row on the balcony and the seats would have been great, except the people in the front row leaned against the railing almost the whole entire time (in addition to me being vertically challenged) and I could not see and had to keep moving from side to side to see some part of the show. So if you are going to buy balcony seats, get the first row and higher up rows...also, dont be afraid of the stool seats - its like personal seating. BTW: the bottom level front row love seats looked pretty fun, but be available to be dragged into the show. ;o)"
Zumanity,"Hated the show... Is it burlesque or cirque de soleil? It was a weird mix of each, choppy and trying too hard to shock"
Zumanity,"By far my most favorite Cirque show in Las Vegas. I absolutly love the intimacy of this show and the easy humor. I really love the colors of this show, and the amazing performers that they have. This show is great for an open minded couple for sure, ITS ABOUT SEX!!!! Its very sexy and beautiful and worth every penny."
Zumanity,"I did enjoy the show, but enjoyed Mystere more.  We sat in the balcony, because it was cheaper.  We were told that the show was mostly aerial, but its not.  I loved the dancing a lot and wished I could do the same.

I agree with the other reviewers that they needed more ventilation.  The theater got really warm towards the end of the show."
Zumanity,"Entertaining from very beginning to the very end. I didnt want it to end. Lots of interaction with the audience. The closer you are to the stage, the more interactive it is for you.  Get there early for the pre-show.  Very funny and the talent is phenomenal!  This show will take you on an exotic erotic journey with its creative imagination and costumes. Very Cirque! Will recommend to everyone I know that is visiting Vegas."
Zumanity,"This Cirque show is for grown ups only. I absolutely love it and have seen it twice. And, I want to see it again and again. If you love risque humor and enjoy being entertained by sexy performers, you must go see Zumanity. This show relies less on lighting, makeup and costumes and more on personality, excitement and sensuality. This isnt a first date kind of show, but is a must-see for couples wishing to add a bit of spark to their regular date night."
Zumanity,"Not very impressed with this show, although my wife enjoyed it more than I did.
There was just nothing that really blew me away, and thought it was a little dull, Id be really pissed if wed paid full price.
I was actually ready to leave 45 minutes in to the show, we stayed for the entire show but it didnt really get any better.
We attended Vegas! The Show the day before at Planet Hollywood, and although is an entirely different type of show, it was 10 times more entertaining than Zumanity. If you see only one show in Vegas I would highly reccomend Vegas! The Show."
Zumanity,Get ready to be entertained!!! This show was SEXY and funny! All the performers were great.  Go with your bf or gf and youll have a great time!
Zumanity,I have seen almost all the Cirque shows. This is a sad excuse for one. It is a great show for 18 and 19 year olds but adults will be bored by its sophmoric humor. Its theatrical value is fair but when compared to the other Cirque shows in Vegas it is low.
Zumanity,"Boring, absolutely not Cirque, lack of acrobatics. The best part is the waterbowl, and maybe the hoops girl.
Id better read the reviews next time. Does not worth money paid."
Zumanity,"The most sensual and artfully inventive choreography and soundtrack, like nothing Ive ever witnessed. So exciting, so sexy, and comically amusing - everything a live show should be! The host of the show is fabulous and the performers are HAWT!!! And YES, you will see titties and ass, maybe more! Definitely NOT a show for the sexually close-minded. Be sure to order a drink (the bartenders make an AMAZING Sex on the Beach), take a peek inside the peep holes before you enter the show, and prepare to sweat and moan and depart from the experience horny as hell."
Zumanity,"fun fun fun sexy sexy sexy hot hot hot!

they do a good job at entertaining! it was funny sexy great!"
Zumanity,"Interesting show, lots of slender athletic women with small boobs giving an entertainment performance.  I didnt enjoy all the ripped gay men floating around, but overall the show was pretty darn good."
Zumanity,Sex &amp; High  Flying circus acts. I purchased balcony seats which were perfect for viewing all the aerial acrobatics.
Zumanity,Just wanted to update after I saw O last night...actually thought Zumanity was better which was surprising considering how everyone raves about O. I think especially on a $ vs $ basis Zumanity is better value...
Zumanity,"I have to disagree with the people giving this show a 1 and 2 stars, this show was more then expected. Yes, it is a CDS show but it is obiviously an adult type of CDS show. It does contain nudity but it was tastefully done. Its not like other adult show where it targets just mens interest. I have recommend this show to two other couples they loved it as much as we did. This is more of a adult sexual humor type of show, you can get a good laugh out of this. I do not recommend any one taking their kids or teenages to see this, but this is more of an couples retreat. This will by far give a Vegas sense, the sins, the excitement, fun and laugh of loud laughters."
Zumanity,"I got a chance to see this show last month with my girlfriend and I felt that it was the perfect close to a perfect day out. While many of the acts were familiar fare for anyone who has seen a couple of Cirque shows, the artistry, sensuality and eroticism really sets this show apart. While Cirques Quidam (my other favorite show) has more of a coherent story which takes center stage, Zumanity is more of an exhibition and celebration of human intimacy and sexuality introduced and expressed through vignettes. My personal favorite act was the Aerial Straps routine... Im sure that got your imagination stirring but trust me, you have no idea until you see it yourself. Another thing I loved were the hilarious and raunchy skits in between major acts carried out by the shows own clowns Izzy (think Pee-Wee Hermans Miss Yvonne with a huge libido), her husband Dick (a smarmy Lothario), Antonio (the epitome of a gigolo) and the Botero sisters (a pair of rotund twins with unabashed sexual appetites). 

Overall, Im in the rare position where I cant actually find anything to complain about. Though, i suppose our seats could have been better. Oh well, next time I guess Ill just have to buy the tickets more than a week and a half in advance."
Zumanity,"Excellent performance! A bit slow at times, but it was a stellar performance by the crew. Great seats at reasonable cost. Funny stints to warm up the crowd. Very Entertaining!"
Zumanity,I thought the show was just OK.  The acrobatics were a little disappointing.  I think Im comparing it to other Cirque du soleil shows which is why I wasnt that happy about it.  It was a little boring.....there wasnt really coooool moments.  It was mildly funny.  Go see it if there arent any other tickets available but be sure to get the cheap tickets.
Zumanity,Grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat show.  Worth every penny.  And the Zumantiy shoppe outside the theatre has lots of interesting things.  Tracy that works there is super nice and very knowledgeable on all the Cirque shows--from characters to costumes. Love the Voluptuous sisters!
Zumanity,"This show was absolutely amazing!! Hilarious, sexy, sensual, and so so enjoyable!

I got tickets for myself and my man, and we had so much fun. The nudity is in no way raunchy, and there is a great variety of acrobatic acts and stunts. This show did not have your typical special effects of a regular cirque show, it was more of like a caberet type show. Comedy acts in between character acts were so funny they made me and my man cry! The french maids in the begining were the best! 

Do not attend this show if you are bashful or conservative, you wont have fun. But if you have an open mind, and a good sense of humor, youll love the show! I recommend going with your sweetheart, or maybe a group of girlfriends, to get the most out of the show!"
Zumanity,"A unique and entertaining experience. This Cirque show relies heavily on audience interaction, and given that its showing in Vegas, many participants are very willing ;) Although I dont think that many of the performers were able to demonstrate the full extent of their acrobatic abilities, I still enjoyed the raunchy banter. It was not my first choice, but definitely a fitting show for Vegas."
Zumanity,"Wish I could give it 4.5 stars.

I agree with the folks complaining that is wasnt neccesarily a Sensual Show...much more of a burlesque/vaudville show, in that was an eclectic mix of acts and comedy.  And, Im sure you could see a lot more boobage at most of the other adult shows in town but...

It was one of the few things my wife and I did in Vegas that I felt was worth the price I paid.  The flat out entertainment factor was very high.  You could tell there were some tremendous athletes on stage, and the comedy intermissions gave you a chance to catch the breath you had been holding while folks swung from ropes.  

I almost feel our seats were too close, as quite a few times you had to split your attention between the main act, and little side things that were going on."
Zumanity,"Ive been to Las Vegas several times, so I decided to try something different this time around. I decided to attend this show, which was recommended to me by my friends. I have to say, it really different-- in a good way. I dont want to give away the whole show, but my favorite part was the two girls in the huge bowl of water. I just loved the artistic way, in which it was presented. Its a very sexy show. Dont shy away; its all artistic and very well-put."
Zumanity,"A woman sitting behind me but a few seats over silently puked all over herself in the red velvet (read: not very cleanable) seats just as the show was starting. Seriously, people, get your shit together!!! This also happened to me recently on the shuttle home from a wedding. Alcohol can get the best of anyone, but theres simply no excuse for adults getting so drunk they cant even figure out that they need to get to a bathroom (or try to do so!). I am personally embarrassed for the women Ive seen do this because they were just too old for that kind of behavior. Even an 18 year old should know better.

Staff were alerted and they attempted to clean the mess in the dark which temporarily masked the smell with ammonia, but it was not gone and just became more and more unbearable as I couldnt get away from it and grew more and more annoyed about how the show was rendered the opposite of sensual. STENCH OF VOMIT = MOJO KILLER.

I had hardly been able to get into my seat since I had to climb over 12 or so people who did not even try to move their legs for me (btw, I am very small). Not to mention I was dead center in the 5th row, so it would be very noticeable by the performers if I got up, and I might even interrupt the show by accident with them moving through the aisles and soaring over the audience and such. I told myself to just... hold... out... for... intermission. At one point, another woman (it appears our sense of smell is much stronger) in my row who was closer to the aisle managed to get the staff to come clean the area again. They were not close enough to me to get their attention without drawing the attention of everyone in the section. The second cleaning helped but faded after a few minutes again. And intermission... never... came. By the time the show was ending, the smell was so overwhelming that I was very near puking myself. And in no mood to go out and drink (though I tried and failed).

I was pissed because I spent a lot of money to get this one night in Vegas that was pretty much ruined. I knew it wasnt Cirques fault per se but I was sure that when I complained they would do something to make the horrendous experience up to me. Because it definitely wasnt my fault, and thats what customer service is all about. But NO, I was completely shut down with nothing more than an apology and a This is Vegas attitude. In fact, I was told it was my own fault for not being an asshole and getting myself reseated during the very dark and very busy show. I wasnt even referred to someone higher up I could talk to. 

The show was great but the customer service was abysmal. I doubt it was the first time anything like this has happened, so I do think its Cirques responsibility to make sure that one customer cant easily ruin the experience of many others. Its not just Vegas -- Cirque pushes 32 oz. drinks on its audience members before virtually locking them into their seats for 2 hours straight. I wouldnt be surprised if drunkards poop themselves too. Ushers seat everyone and maybe its their responsibility to identify people who are too drunk to participate in the show. Cirque, Ive been a long time fan, and you owe me better treatment."
Zumanity,"I am too tired to write anything of any substance here but Ill get to the point-I hope you apreciate it. . I have seen Mystere, O, KA, Zumanity, and Chris Angel Believe. Hopefully this gives me some credibility to write an objective review. In order of what I would see 1.) Mystere the original and I think still the best  2.)  O (Visually stunniong performance over water) 3.)  KA (Boring) 4.) Chris Angel (This show sucked no magic tricks no acrobatics? 5.) Zumanity (Honestly you call this adult and provocative sorry I thought the show didnt hit the mark in this respect and was pretty contrived. Go to a Strip Club instead."
Zumanity,"AWESOMELY FUNNY AND SEXY!!! Had a GREAT TIME! You cant be a prude to see this show! Loosen up and have fun!

The only draw back is the typical Vegas drunkard in the audience, 2 or 3 people were not acting their age and were yelling at the performers to take it off or gimme your number and SEVERAL women or shall I say girls because they were obviously NOT mature enough to be there due to their immature laughs at certain things and wouldnt shut up about it.
We also saw a young looking girl with her mother standing in line in front of us, its an 18+ show and she didnt look a day older than 15! She got through, but wonder if they actually carded her.

But overall, AWESOME show, 1 draw back is NO intermission!"
Zumanity,"I LOVED this show. My husband and I went to Vegas 2 years ago to get married and it was our first time. We went to a few shows but nothing compared to Zumanity. Before the actual show starts, some of the performers walk around and are interactive with the crowd. I got to be one of the lucky ones and it was just HILARIOUS! Its out of the ordinary and the performers are so talented. I was thoroughly entertained through the entire show and would even watch it again!"
Zumanity,"The hula-hoop girl and the two lovely ladies in the big glass bowl were incredible and offered things that Id never seen before. The rest of the time I was only mildly amused or amazed. I know I, nor anyone else in the audience, could NEVER do the things the talented people of Zumanity were doing but I felt like I had seen all the stunts before in smaller shows and had expected more from a big Vegas show. Basically I went home a bit disappointed, but I wasnt the only one.... As I waited outside the bathroom for my boyfriend I heard a few other people griping about the same things! Its Vegas... give us MORE!"
Zumanity,"Thats one muscular dwarf.  Excellent show -- erotic but not ridiculous.  The fishbowl acrobatics were amazing, and some acts were a wry critique on traditional sexual roles.  I think most of the women in the audience identified with the scene in which the female dancer attempts to  shift the male dancers attention from the television to herself.  Warning: homosexual content inside, in case any fundamentalists visiting Sin City are attending an erotic cabaret show.  When will Cirque de Soleil nationalize Las Vegas and make it the new capital of Quebec?"
Zumanity,"Recommend it. Made me horny, enjoyed the performances and the hot chicks, appreciated the sensuality, what else is there? Its Vegas and if youre a couple mos def something good to wet the appetite, if youre into that like me. =P Our seats were at the front row but on the left side of the stage. Nice views that were closeup and intimate, but Ive heard its better to sit in the middle and further back to see the full scope of the stage. I dunno about that but I enjoyed the close up view myself. Pricey but worth it, afterall its Vegas baby!"
Zumanity,"its so sexual w/ a lot of adult humor, what more can you ask for."
Zumanity,"Could we have more men? Id like to see more men. Please? Other then that, the show was okay. I dont know if it was quite worth the cost, but entertaining none-the-less. The contortionist was very unnerving/creepy. More men please. (And not ones like the contortionist...) Thanks!"
Zumanity,"I didnt think the show was all that sexy per se but it certainly was fun and not for the prudish or homophobic. First off, the performers are gorgeous - no butterfaces in that group. I also appreciated the fact that natural dancers bodies were the norm, rather than the weird inflated robo-boobs you get used to seeing when something is supposed to be sexy. 

The show itself was a bit corny at times but I appreciated most of the vignettes, both the comedy and the erotic ones. My only real complaint is that there isnt enough emphasis on the male performers. Only one was really featured in an overtly sexy way (well, besides the cage dance that was geared towards the gay male crowd) and he totally had gayface and was wearing a rhinestone g-string, which kind of made him seem silly to me. Still, a very fun way to spend an evening. Its worth the time and money spent."
Zumanity,"This show was excellent. It was very interesting, and I really didnt know what to expect. I also didnt realize the host was a dude in drag. Perhaps it was the angle I was sitting at and never got a clear view. 

I love the humor in these shows. 

This is now a show you want to take your mother to, unless you are dating her. Adults only."
Zumanity,"Finally got to see Zumanity. Had some funny sex humor(which I like) and boobs which I love.  It was pretty entertaining although there was this one part in the show where this woman was simulating an orgasm while on some black ropes(swings?). Even I thought that was knd of weird. No one knew when to even clap so everyone just clapped at the end of her skit. I did see one couple leave but whatever. Next on my list, Ka..."
Zumanity,"This was our first Cirque show. We went last Saturday night since our Celine Dion concert for the night was cancelled. We heard it was a little edgy, racy, and interesting, so the wife and I decided to check it out. I saw the warnings about sitting in the front, but because we got discount tickets at one of the booths on the strip, that was what we got and there was no choice. We didnt get picked on though. The show was interesting. There were exposed natural(vice fake) breasts, some making out and sexual simulations, dancing, acrobatics, comedy/jokes/humor and the like. Youre not looking at porn, nor is it like being in a strip club. It is just a very different type of show, and we did enjoy it. Im not really sure how to describe it. My guess is that it aims to set a mood for whatever you want to do later(which anything you chose and are in to is ok according to the MC). There was also some interaction between the performers and the audience, which we were happy NOT to be a part of. We saw Absinthe the night before(review posting soon), and though people compare the 2 of them, the wife and I agree they are quite different. Definitely a date night option if both parties are open minded and up for something different. Not so sure this is good for a group of guys or girls. Hopefully this review helps, though Im confusing myself as I write it."
Zumanity,"Not weird enough.

Cirque is great. It is truly on of the few things I see in life which inspire awe in me. Ive seen Mystere a number of times and every time I come away with newfound respect for the potentiality of Humanity. It is with that frame of mind I stepped into the theater showing Zumanity. I expected nude everything and flexible midgets seeping out of empty seats. Alas, I was disappointed. It starts with the master of ceremonies being some gaunt tranny in a corset which I suppose is to shock the audience, and it does ...unless you live in San Francisco. Then there are all kinds of naked people except for the fact that they are in fact not naked atall. In all fairness, would you climb up a pole not using your hands AND not wear any protection for your special member? So, in a nutshell Id say this show gets 3 stars because the strangeness and overt sexuality are only as skin deep as their nudeness. 

I did really dig the chick/midget/rope-over-the-audience act. 4 thousand stars for that one! Anytime you have a midget being flung over me on a rope held from a womans mouth.....well hell, there are no words for my level of satisfaction. Also, the Chinese water bowl thing is outstanding. I still cant figure out how that dame does that thing with her ribs."
Zumanity,"Let me start off by saying Im not a huge fan of Cirque du Soleil.  I came here because my cousin wanted to go here during her bachelorette party weekend with the girls.  Of any of the Cirque du Soleil shows this is probably the only one Id ever see of my own volition, mostly because of the bawdy humor.  Well that and the men with the tights and obscenely gigantic packages (check my pics for a sample!).  Stuffed or not, those men do contribute to making it an entertaining night.

Every act in the show touches on the subject of sex.  Not just because most of the women are topless and the tightness of the mens tights, for example theres a portion where a womans doing what I can only describe as a bondage-silk-tie-masturbatory acrobatic act.  The comedic interlude between sets are hilarious too, a word to the wise if you stick out in the crowd you just might be pulled up onstage so you better be ready to blush.  It is a pricey show so if youre going to pay the money you might as well go for it and get one of the lounge-y couch seats up front.  Again though it does increase the likelihood that youre going to be pulled up onstage."
Zumanity,"I love cirque du soleil shows but after watching so many of them, I think i am starting to get jaded to the acts.  This show was mostly flying acts...Overall though, it was a good show...it reminded me of a variety show where they have a little bit of everything all with the theme of being sexy.  For our purposes this was the perfect show for our vegas trip because we came with friends who havent been to vegas before and it has a bit of everything.  This show has cirque du soleil flavor, it has male and female nudity, it has water, it has audience participation, it has singing, it has music &amp; band, it has comedy, it has dance, and it had a nice stage.  so overall, rather nice for a one show vegas trip."
Zumanity,The fishbowl chicks were hot. Other than that I was pretty bored. The drag queen was out of his effing head and had a weird body. I cant believe I spent $75 on my ticket. Boooo.
Zumanity,Definitely a sexy show! And surprisingly funny. The boyfriend and I went to celebrate his birthday and very much enjoyed the show. Zumanity encapsulates the insane Cirque gymnastics with an added bonus of vaudeville style comedy. There is even some audience involvement! Arrive early and you can take pictures with some of the Zumanity creatures roaming the theater entrance. Locals! Call the box office for local specials.
Zumanity,"Two stars is all I could give.  We bought these tickets online a got a discount, came to about 65 a ticket.  Anyways, this was last year in the summer.  I watched a Cirque show in the City years ago, this was before Vegas started showing them.  It was before Bell Park.  It was a Chinese New Year, something Dragon, cant quite remember the name.  So in my mind, I am always wondering how good the other shows are gonna be.  Decided to go to this one because many of the others were too booked.  It started off good, exciting to watch the 2 swimmers in the big bowl, then the jokers were okay, that was about it.  Serious, if you gave me free tixs, I wouldnt go again.  I just got tixs for the O show next week, that is the one I have been waiting for.  Got a 25% off at Bellagio.com, and its only for certain days at 10:30 shows."
Zumanity,Hot girls? check!  Almost naked dudes? wtf!  The girls were definitely hot and skilled but the dudes grossed me out.  Im no homophobe but I was definitely bothered by the two half naked dudes french kissing right in front of me.  Me and my ex-gf had booked the front row love seats and I guess it was a little too close for comfort during that scene.  The dudes were making out right in front of us and they stank.  Full on body odor.  That just ruined the show for me.  Everything else up to that moment was fine.  I hope the removed that act from the show.
Zumanity,"This show was FANTASTIC! The performers were all pretty hot, the acrobatics were amazing, and the show was actually really funny. It will be hard for me to go to Vegas and not see this show. Watch it with an open mind."
Zumanity,Funny and sexy and a little naughty.  A perfect show for Vegas.  Make sure youre comfortable with some nudity!
Zumanity,"Not as good as O, but still amazing. Its very sensual, so you have to be in that frame of mind to get into it. But once you get into it, its an incredible show. 
Funny story: We went to a strip club after the show, and found it sad that there were girls doing almost the same thing as Cirque for much, much more money. Bummer."
Zumanity,"My 4th cirque du soleil show... very good for its subject matter, but one word of advice... even though it has elements from the acrobatics that makes cirque famous, its not a good starter show for someone who has never seen cirque before."
Zumanity,"HOT!! Id never been to Cirque show before, so I had nothing to compare it to as far as acrobatics and whatnot, but Zumanity was sexy, sensual, beautiful, rauchy and hilarious in all the right places.  The water bowl scene was beautiful, and the bathtub scene with the milk almost gave me fits (did you see that mans BODY?). Zumanity was a great inauguration into Cirque.  I loved that it was completely indulgent, unabashed, and uninhibited.  Maybe I have simple tastes, but who doesnt love to watch hot bodies writhe and gyrate on stage?"
Zumanity,"Incredibly artistic and visually stimulating from the lesbian water contortionists to the midget and tall blond aerial silk combo. There was definitely an act for every type of sexual deviant out there no matter your flavor. For me, I fell in love with Cirque du Soleil for the amazing feats and distinguishing acts that set these people apart from those of us who cannot walk on our pinkies while twisted into a pretzel and I didnt really find that much of an ooh aah factor in this show."
Zumanity,"This is the most entertaining Cirque show that I have seen.  I would not go into expecting to see awesome acrobatics. Its not that kind of show, rather it is provocative showcase done in a tasteful manner."
Zumanity,"Perfect blend of comedy, Cirque style acrobatics, sensuality, and burlesque dance.  We had awesome seats -- front row lounge seating which means we were privy to all of the sexy and sassy antics.  Loved the scotch baggies routine.  Loved the caged routine as well -- very sensual.  Loved that Zumanity had various sized performers.  Loved the rope act.  Loved the MC.  Loved the shades of red and how light and dark played on my senses.  If you have any issues with nudity, raunchy language or suggestions, homosexuality, or eroticism then this is not a show for you.  If you say bring it on, then see Zumanity and be prepared for a treat!!"
Zumanity,"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and it was AMAZING.  It is an adult show and not for those who are offended easily.  Theres not a bad seat in the house and you can get discount tickets at a place like Tix 4 Tonight, but the closer you sit the more interactive you may be with the talent witch may or may not be what youre looking for."
Zumanity,I thought in many ways it was better than O. And not because of the boobs.  It was a very good funny show.
Zumanity,"I loved the show, especially because I was pulled up on stage! Out of all people they pulled me up! For those that watched the show, I was brought up for the knife throwing act. They give you a free 8x10 picture of you upstage after the show =]. The show is very entertaining and is more for the younger crowd ages 20-40. I had an old guy next to me that fell asleep throughout the whole show. This show is very different from other Cirque du Soleil shows so beware of what youre about to watch."
Zumanity,"Watched it 05/03/08, Im more into the acrobatics acts that O, Le Reve and KA had so I was kinda bored during the show. The acrobatics acts they  did have were more soft and sexual which definatly fit the theme of the show. So they did have a good production, but overall the show was not for me. The best part of the show was when they got the crowd involved with the jokes and all. Super funny"
Zumanity,"this is easily in the top 5 list of any live performance of any kind i have attended, right up there with the cramps and iggy pop, zumanity.

this show is beautiful, sexy, and has a little of everything for everyone.

my initial draw was that i am a huge fan of joey arias.  i dont think he is MCing this show anymore but its a fantastic show.  

of course, its gotta be your thing."
Zumanity,Tries too hard to be sensual over compensates with boobs burlesque show style.  The host was bad too.
Zumanity,"This was the very first Cirque du Soleil performance I had ever seen.  My wife told me that its very different from what I had heard about other Cirque du Soleil shows as she had seen Zumanity before.  I thought it was odd that I had to be an adult to watch the show but as soon as it started I could see why - almost nude good looking performers doing a lot of sexual innuendos on a small stage with a smaller than usual audience.  It was very entertaining but for my first Cirque du Soleil experience, it wasnt the best one.  Had I seen Mystere or O first, then maybe I would have appreciated Zumanity more now that I had something to compare it to and be more constructive.  I would say my favorite act of the show was when these 2 lady contortionists performed their acrobatics inside this glass bowl.  Amazing to watch and erotic at the same time."
Zumanity,All I can say is WOW!! I have never seen so many fit people in one place. The acrobatics and dance were awesome!! Great music and great entertainment.. The only thing if you sit near the front your going to be pulled on stage.. Scarey I think I would faint. Otherwise you have to check this out.
Zumanity,"I wonder if all the cuts they are making in Vegas to stay profitable are also affecting the shows. This is the least impressive Cirque show and not worth the ticket price. Also, compared to similar sexy shows in Europe, this is MILD! Its all like a glorified cabaret show, with some artsy fartsy thrown in: rip-off. I agree the best act was the water-bowl asian lesbian piece. As a gay man, I would have liked at least a hint of man on man action."
Zumanity,"Wow! I was in Vegas this weekend and made a last min decision to see Zumanity and I did not regret it. All I can say about it is AMAZING, the show was great, it was funny, entertaining, and incredible. I would absolutely recommend it, a must see if youre in Vegas."
Zumanity,"My husband and I werent sure what to expect when we got tickets to Zumanity, but we heard a lot of good things about this show from friends.  This show has a lot of sexuality and a little bit of comedy all rolled into one show.  The performers first come out to where the audiences are and they have quite a dirty and funny act which was hilarious and I was laughing so hard.  I dont recommend sitting in the front row unless you want to take the chance of them picking on you to ask you some intimate questions in front of everyone.  I didnt expect to get so much laughter out of this show but I did."
Zumanity,"I cant find the right words to describe this show. Its very entertaining and you will definitely have fun. Its sexy, raunchy, and overall awesome. Go see it now!!"
Zumanity,This was funny and sexy show. Its worth the money and it was quite entertaining.
Zumanity,"Ok, expected risque. Probably shouldnt have bought front row seats to this particular show if I was going to it with my entire office. Or maybe shouldnt have arrived early. Maybe then I wouldnt have had the guy that interacts with the audience before the show shoving his crotch in my face, but thats what happened. 

Not for the easily embarrassed but I still liked it. It can be very intimate at times and there is nudity."
Zumanity,"Excellent show, This is a very good show and has amazing production value for a Vegas show ( which should be expected for a Cirque Du Soleil show) If you are unsure about topless shows but want to check it out this is a must. If you have seen other topless vegas show you will also enjoy this show. We ordered our tickets though Vegas.com and got 3rd row seats at balcony price. The performers come out into the audience and interact with you and actually pulled 3 or 4 people onto the stage to be apart of the show( they were actual audience members not planted cast members. ( if you dont want to interact just tell them no thanks you and they will move on, or buy tickets further back it is a very big theater and they only seemed to pull people in the first few rows. ) The show was interesting and you almost forget there are topless woman on the stage and topless men for the ladies. I have seen a number of topless vegas shows and this is one of the best. These are very talented performers and there is a good deal of acrobatics and dancing. If you only see one show in Vegas see this one.  ** Best for Couples or a group of woman** Dont take your mom to this show it cold be awkward,**"
Zumanity,I prefer other cirque du soleil Shows.
Zumanity,"This show blows. Save your self the money and just go to a strip club thats all it is, tricks really suck. Its like a crappy crack head beach street performance with strippers no visuals nothing."
Zumanity,"ive seen this show twice and it was different each time. it is definitely not a show for kids. its very exotic and sensual. if youre not the type to be open with your sexuality, this may not be the show for you either. this particular show is a combination of burlesque (topless women) and cirque. i think that its perfectly made for vegas.  -- stars based on category, not food"
Zumanity,"My wife and I just saw this show Saturday night. It was without a doubt the worst of the Cirque du Soleil shows. While we very much enjoyed all the other shows, this Zumanity does not live up to its hype. It was not sexy unless you consider looking at women with the breasts of a 13 year old sexy. The show was just too poorly created. Dont waste your money!!!"
Zumanity,"This show definitely EARNS the 5 STARS! Its great, Im not going to compare it to any other Cirque du Soleil show. This show is an ADULT show, but its not raunchy, its fun and sexy. I thought everything about it was great. I took my girlfriend at the time and she loved it, shoot I even think it got me laid... =) But seriously, whether its just a group of girls or a guy taking your girl, you cant go wrong with this show. I will say that if youre uptight and get easily offended by sex, ummm well maybe its not for you, but then again you wouldnt be in SIN CITY anyway... As a matter of fact Im going to look for tickets to go again... I sat in section 103 in the 3rd row the theatre isnt huge so theres not really technically a bad seat, but if you like to be up close and dont want to get the sofa seats then sec 103 and 104 orchestra seats are great. Heres a tip to get great seats... CALL, dont buy them online and if you must buy them online buy them from the ny ny website. When you call you can ask them for the best available seats and they will give you choices rather than you just getting stuck with whatever you bought online."
Zumanity,this was my first experience going to a las vegas show and if i never see another one  it will be ok because zumanity was the shit! breath taking sensual exciting had me stirring in my seat all through out the show. i had the pleasure of experiencing this show with my man it was a birthday treat. he was so excited. the performances were to die for and i liked how they got the audience involved. having front row seats on a plush love seat was awsome.
Zumanity,"Why do I love watching Cirque shows so much? Oh thats right, Cause theyre all freaking totally awesome!! And Zumanity is no different. Super sexy and oh so sensual, with just the right amount of acrobatics. For the guys going to watch, there is definitely good eye candy. And for the ladies, youll be drooling as well. For me, it was the hot chick with the hula hoops. Yeah!!! those that watched the show know who Im talkin bout. hehehehe. I was sittin 3rd row on the side, so it was pretty close, and I like it! But from what I noticed all seats were good. Its definitely not as big a theater as the other Cirque shows. So wherever you sit, youll see everything worth seeing pretty well. Theres one skit where the guy has the fake ding ding on, and he steps over the audience. He crawls over my friend and hops over her seat and his fake weenis was right there in her face. I laughed so hard. HAHAHAHA, Im still crackin up just thinkin bout it. Great show. I knew what i was gettin when I watched it. Not like any other Cirque show in terms of presentation. Ok, I think I said what I wanted to get across. So yeah Zumanity in latin means A whales Vagina. JK it means AWESOME!"
Zumanity,"I enjoyed this show. I agree that some of the routines were similiar but still incredible. I saw some complaints about the humor being too campy. Its got to be dificult to find things that will be funny to most and offend as few as possible. I thought it was funny and sexy. It may be geared a little more toward men but thats typical. We sat in section 101. If I get a chance to go again, I would get section 102, 103, 203 or 303."
Zumanity,"I wasnt overly impressed. We got a great deal on tickets so we checked it out. I wouldnt have paid full price for tickets, and neither should you."
Zumanity,"Expect a lot of audience interaction and talk, not that much CDS, but the show overall provided a lot of laughs. Good music, as well. :)"
Zumanity,"I have seen a few Cirque shows and i was not really all that impressed with this particular show. Tired old sexual jokes and gags. I have seen and heard all this stuff many times many places before. I really did not like the skit about the Instant implants made with whiskey. Really dumb. Yawn. Not hot! . Not much of anything. The entire show was sort of flat.(in more ways than one)  I did like the water ballet in the huge glass at the beginning of the show, but it was downhill from there. This show has lots of talent and potential, but it is wasted by lack of creativity. It seems like they did a Slam Bam, lets put a show together quickly.much better Cirque shows in Vegas than this one....would not repeat , zzzzzz, caught myself  fake laughing and then yawning. good thing they did not get me up on stage for anything or i would have used the time to fall asleep. After seeing Bon Jovi concert the night before this was a bore."
Zumanity,"This definitely isnt the best Cirque du Soleil show Ive seen...  I watched this a few years ago, so Im not sure if they have changed it (I doubt it).  I loved the concept of potraying love in a sensual &amp; artistic way, but it just didnt wow me like the other shows."
Zumanity,"did the people on this post see that same show i saw? i hate leaving bad reviews for shows knowing how hard the performers work!! but i think the writing needs a major face lift for this show. again, not knocking the entertainers but the advertisements show that this show will be sexy...daring. it has very very mundane humor. the humor seemed like it was from a 1962 playboy or something...you know, those little cartoons they have through the magazine? i.e. nothing earth shattering. 

the mc of the show was excellent. the hula hoop girls was incredible... however, there was very limited acrobatic acts and i dunno..its just didnt work. la reve blew this away in its sexiness and physicality."
Zumanity,We sat in the first row of the balcony- good seats. I really enjoyed the show! I would recommend this to others.
