# Scalable Topic Detection Web Application


Overview:  
The goal of this project is to design a scalable user-friendly web application to automate certain tasks which replaces manual work of dealing with customer feedback. This tool allows a client to feed the topic response variables depending on their convenience and provide a robust API fetching mechanism to generate training data through a variety of methods. Once we obtain train data, we pre-train the model using a Bag-Of-Words approach to assign one of the response variables to each record. Finally, we integrate Gmail or a different third party vendor to fetch new information real-time to send an appropriate response based on the topic assigned using LDA/LSA algor
